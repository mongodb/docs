"MongoDB Enterprise includes an auditing capability for :program:`mongod` and"
" :program:`mongos` instances. The auditing facility allows administrators "
"and users to track system activity for deployments with multiple users and "
"applications. The auditing facility can write audit events to the console, "
"the :term:`syslog`, a JSON file, or a BSON file. For details on the audit "
"log messages, see :doc:`/reference/audit-message`."
