     * - :guilabel:`Database` and :guilabel:`Collection`

       - The collection to which the index applies. Specify both
         the database and the collection.

     * - :guilabel:`Field`

       - The field to index.

         You must specify a data field. TTL indexes expire 
         documents after the specified number of seconds has 
         passed since the indexed field value.

     * - :guilabel:`Expiration`

       - For a :manual:`TTL index </core/index-ttl>`, the number
         of seconds to wait after the 
         :ref:`date <document-bson-type-date>` specified in the
         indexed field before removing the document. The 
         expiration time is the field value plus the specified 
         number of seconds.
