Solution Overview
-----------------

In the competitive business landscape of manufacturing, having the right
inventory of goods in the right place at the right time is crucial.
Insufficient inventory leads to operational disruptions and missed
opportunities. Excess inventory increases costs and risks associated
with storage. Companies of all sizes struggle with inventory management.

Solutions, such as a single view of inventory, real-time analytics, and
event-driven architectures, can help businesses overcome these
challenges and improve their inventory management.

This guide covers the process of building an inventory management system
tailored for diverse industries, such as manufacturing.

Inventory Management in the Manufacturing Industry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modern manufacturing supply chains are complex, interconnected systems.
Efficient supply chains can control operational costs and ensure on-time
delivery to customers. Inventory optimization and management are key
components in achieving these goals. While maintaining higher inventory
levels enables suppliers to manage unexpected fluctuations in demand,
they come with higher inventory-holding costs that might be passed on to
customers. Thus, every player in the supply chain strives to strike a
balance between inventory levels to maximize profitability and
competitive advantage in the market. Effective inventory management
mitigates the risk of the bullwhip effect, in which sudden demands can
disrupt the supply chain costs and performance.

A significant example of inventory management challenges in
manufacturing involves overstock. `Nearly 8% of surplus stock globally
will ultimately end up as waste
<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-11-10/supply-chain-latest-inventory-waste-totals-163-billion-a-year>`__,
with approximately $163 billion of inventory discarded annually. For
manufacturers, managing and optimizing inventory levels starts with
maintaining an accurate and real-time view of inventory levels across
multiple plants, warehouses, and suppliers. This visibility is essential
because it is impossible to optimize without visibility into current
inventory levels.

Real-time data integration helps manufacturers track inventory movements
and optimize stock levels, but it also is essential for automation.
Automated alerts and workflow triggers maintain inventory levels without
constant manual oversight. This automation improves accuracy and enables
manufacturers to respond swiftly to changes in production needs or
supply chain disruptions, maintaining a smooth operation.

In this system, MongoDB helps businesses enhance service
quality, workforce efficiency, and optimize stock management by
enabling a single view of inventory, event-driven architectures,
and real-time analytics.

These capabilities lay the groundwork for other advanced scenarios,
such as:

- IoT and RFID Tag Integration

- AI/ML Forecasts for precise demand prediction

- Distributed logistics

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

The inventory management solution leverages a Next.js_ application
seamlessly integrated with `MongoDB Atlas`_, providing a flexible and
scalable backend, as shown in :ref:`Figure 2
<arch-is-event-driven-inventory-fig-2>`.

The solution uses the following components:

- `MongoDB Atlas`_ stores four key collections: ``products``,
  ``transactions``, ``users``, and ``locations``. These collections
  manage inventory, process transactions, and track user and location
  data.

- ACID-compliant_ operations ensure data consistency and integrity,
  particularly during stock level changes due to transactions. Both the
  ``products`` and ``transactions`` collections receive updates to
  maintain reliability and consistency across the system.

- The application connects to MongoDB through the :node-docs:`MongoDB
  Node.js </>` driver.

- `Atlas Search`_ enhances the applications' search capabilities,
  enabling advanced full-text search features. This allows users to
  perform complex queries, such as searching by product category or
  applying :ref:`facet <facet-tutorial>` filters.

- :ref:`triggers-overview` automate backend logic by executing functions
  in response to database changes, such as automatically reordering
  inventory when stock falls below a certain threshold.

- :ref:`changeStreams` act as real-time listeners, detecting changes in
  the database and pushing updates to the application. This enables
  real-time alerts, such as low stock notifications, to be sent to
  inventory managers.

- `Atlas Charts`_ provides a visualization tool for real-time
  analytics, allowing users to create interactive charts and
  dashboards directly from MongoDB data. This empowers
  decision-makers to track key metrics, such as inventory levels
  and sales trends, in real time.

- :ref:`Workload isolation <workload-isolation>`  analytics queries
  run on a dedicated node, which ensures that operational performance
  remains unaffected.

This cohesive architecture supports real-time data interactions and
automates key tasks to streamline processes. It allows the Next.js
application to provide a responsive and dynamic user experience, built
on MongoDB's robust data management features.

Through this integration, the solution effectively balances performance,
automation, and scalability, making it well-suited for modern inventory
management challenges.

Architecture with MongoDB

   Atlas and Next.js

Data Model Approach
-------------------

The inventory management system stores data across four collections:
``products``, ``transactions``, ``users``, and ``locations``. These
collections respectively represent stock, incoming and outgoing
movements that affect stock levels, application users, and the locations
the system serves.

What sets the document data model apart from traditional tabular models
is its remarkable flexibility. With a tabular approach, achieving a
comprehensive overview of your inventory would typically involve complex
joins across multiple tables. With MongoDB's document model, this
complexity is eliminated.

.. figure:: /includes/images/industry-solutions/event-driven-data-model.svg
   :figwidth: 1200px
   :alt: Equivalent relational model for product.

   Figure 3. Product collection equivalent in a tabular setup

The ``transactions`` collection uses the `Extended
Reference`_ pattern to reference items. As such, the transaction
document includes the ``product.id`` field for internal
reference, and the ``product.name``. This pattern allows the UI
to display relevant information to the user without using
additional queries or joins on the ``products`` collection.

The ``products`` collection contains what would require 10 separate
tables in a relational database. The individual documents include:

- Embedded arrays for product variants, allowing different
  configurations of the same product to be stored together.

- Product stock and location information, which would typically require
  additional tables in a relational database.

This flexibility provides a more intuitive design, optimizes
data access, and ensures related data is stored together.

   are embedded within the document
