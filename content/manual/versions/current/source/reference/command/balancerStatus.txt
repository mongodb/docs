Output Document
---------------

The following is an example of a document returned by the command:

.. code-block:: json

   {
      "mode" : "full",
      "inBalancerRound" : false,
      "numBalancerRounds" : NumberLong(86),
      "ok" : 1
   }

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``"mode"``

     - A string that specifies whether the balancer thread is running
       or stopped. Possible values are:

       - "full"
           Balancer thread is running but not necessarily in a
           balancing round.

       - "off"
           Balancer thread is stopped. No chunk balancing can occur in
           this mode.
   
   * - ``"inBalancerRound"``

     - A boolean that specifies if the balancer is in a
       balancing round. If ``inBalancerRound=true``, it is now
       distributing chunks.

       ``inBalancerRound`` can be ``true`` when ``mode=off``. If you turn the balancer
       off while it's in a balancing round, the server lets it finish
       rather than interrupting it.

   * - ``"numBalancerRounds"``

     - The number of balancer rounds which have occurred since the
       config servers were started. This value is not persisted and is
       reset to 0 upon restart of the config servers.

Example
-------

Connect to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance and issue the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { balancerStatus: 1 } )
