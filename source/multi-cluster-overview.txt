The beta release of the |multi-clusters| enables different levels of
resilience, depending on the needs of your enterprise application:

- **Single Region, Multi AZ**. One or more |k8s| clusters where you deploy
  each cluster's nodes in different zones in the same region. Such deployments
  protect MongoDB instances backing your enterprise applications against
  zone and |k8s| cluster failures and offer increased availability,
  disaster recovery, and data distribution within one cloud region.

- **Multi Region**. One or more |k8s| clusters where you deploy each cluster
  in a different region, and within each region, deploy cluster nodes in
  different availability zones. This gives your database resilience against
  the loss of a |k8s| cluster, a zone, or an entire cloud region.

|Multi-clusters| allow you to add MongoDB instances in global clusters
that span multiple geographic regions for increased availability and
global distribution of data.

The following diagram shows the high-level architecture of a |multi-cluster|
across regions and availability zones. To learn more, see :ref: `multi-cluster-arch-ref`.

.. note::

   We recommend that you use a service mesh to enable inter-cluster
   communication between the replica set members deployed in different
   |k8s| clusters. MongoDB development has tested this feature using |istio|,
   but any service mesh that provides FQDN resolution between Pods across
   clusters should work.
