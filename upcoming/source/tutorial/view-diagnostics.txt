|mms| collects and displays metrics for your servers, databases,
and MongoDB processes in your deployments. All hardware metrics 
include metrics or individual charts for maximum values.

View Metrics
------------

You can view metrics in the following ways:

:ref:`Replica Sets <view-replica-set-metrics>`
   View the metrics for a specific replica set in a 
   :ref:`project <projects>`.

:ref:`Sharded Clusters <view-sharded-cluster-metrics>`
   View the metrics for a specific sharded cluster in a
   :ref:`project <projects>`.

:ref:`MongoDB Processes <view-mongodb-process-metrics>`
   View the metrics for a specific MongoDB process in an 
   |mms| cluster.

:ref:`Real-Time Performance <real-time-metrics-status-tab>`
   View real-time performance metrics for a specific |mms| 
   deployment in a :ref:`project <projects>`.

Important Metrics
-----------------

You can monitor the following metrics to quickly gauge the health of 
your deployment.

   * - Chart

     - Description
  
   * - :guilabel:`Connections`

     - Number that indicates the total active connections to the 
       deployment.
       
       Monitor connections to determine whether the current connection 
       limits are sufficient.

       To learn more, see :ref:`Fix Lost Primary <no-primary>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Disk IOPS`
  
     - Number that indicates the input operations per second.

       Monitor whether disk IOPS approaches the maximum provisioned 
       IOPS. Determine whether the cluster can handle future workloads.

       To learn more, see :ref:`Fix IOPS Issues <disk-io-util>` and 
       :ref:`Fix Lost Primary <no-primary>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Query Targeting`
    
     - Number that indicates the efficiency of read operations run on   
       MongoDB.
       
       Monitor query targeting metrics to identify inefficent queries.

       To learn more, see :ref:`Fix Query Issues 
       <query-targeting-resolution>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Normalized System CPU`

     - Number that indicates CPU usage of all processes on the node, 
       scaled to a range of 0-100% by dividing by the number of CPU 
       cores.

       Monitor CPU usage to determine whether data is retrieved from 
       disk instead of memory.

       To learn more, see :ref:`Fix IOPS Issues <disk-io-util>`, 
       :ref:`Fix Lost Primary <no-primary>`, and :ref:`Fix CPU Usage 
       Issues <system-cpu>`.
