Open a Change Stream
--------------------

You can watch for changes in MongoDB using the ``watch()`` method on the
following objects:

- `Collection <{+api+}/classes/Collection.html#watch>`__
- `Database <{+api+}/classes/Db.html#watch>`__
- `MongoClient <{+api+}/classes/MongoClient.html#watch>`__

For each object, the ``watch()`` method opens a **change stream** to
emit **change event** documents when they occur.

The ``watch()`` method optionally takes an **aggregation pipeline** which consists of an array of **aggregation stages**
as the first parameter. The aggregation stages filter and transform the change events.

In the following snippet, the ``$match`` stage matches all change event documents with a ``runtime`` value of less than
15, filtering all others out.

.. code-block:: javascript

   const pipeline = [ { $match: { runtime: { $lt: 15 } } } ];
   const changeStream = myColl.watch(pipeline);

The ``watch()`` method accepts an ``options`` object as the second parameter. Refer to the links at the end of this
section for more information on the settings you can configure with this object.

The ``watch()`` method returns an instance of a `ChangeStream <{+api+}/classes/ChangeStream.html>`__. You can read events from
change streams by iterating over them or listening for events. 

Select the tab that corresponds to the way you want to
read events from the change stream:

      :tabid: Idiomatic Iteration

      Starting in version 4.12, ``ChangeStream`` objects are async
      iterables. With this change, you can use ``for-await`` loops to
      retrieve events from an open change stream:

      .. code-block:: js
         :copyable: false
      
         for await (const change of changeStream) {
           console.log("Received change: ", change);
         }

   .. tab::
      :tabid: Manual Iteration

      You can call methods on the ``ChangeStream`` object such as:

      - ``hasNext()`` to check for remaining documents in the stream
      - ``next()`` to request the next document in the stream
      - ``close()`` to close the ChangeStream


   .. tab::
      :tabid: Event

      You can attach listener functions to the ``ChangeStream``  object
      by calling the ``on()`` method. This method is inherited from the
      Javascript ``EventEmitter`` class. Pass the string ``"change"`` as
      the first parameter and your listener function as the second parameter as shown below:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         changeStream.on("change", (changeEvent) => { /* your listener function */ });

      The listener function triggers when a ``change`` event is emitted. You
      can specify logic in the listener to process the change event document
      when it is received.

      You can control the change stream by calling ``pause()`` to stop emitting events or ``resume()`` to continue to emit events.

      To stop processing change events, call the `close() <{+api+}/classes/ChangeStream.html#close>`__ method on the
      ``ChangeStream`` instance. This closes the change stream and frees resources.

      .. code-block:: javascript

         changeStream.close();

Examples

Iteration
~~~~~~~~~

The following example opens a change stream on the ``haikus`` collection in
the ``insertDB`` database and prints change events as they occur:

.. include:: /includes/connect-guide-note.rst

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: JavaScript
      :tabid: javascript

      .. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/usage-examples/changeStream.js
         :language: javascript
         :linenos:

   .. tab:: TypeScript
      :tabid: typescript

      .. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/usage-examples/changeStream.js
         :language: javascript
         :linenos:

.. note:: Identical Code Snippets

   The JavaScript and TypeScript code snippets above are identical. There are no
   TypeScript specific features of the driver relevant to this use case.

When you run this code and then make a change to the ``haikus``
collection, such as performing an insert or delete operation, you can
see the change event document printed in your terminal.

For example, if you insert a document to the collection, the code prints
the following output:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Received change:
   {
     _id: {
       _data: '...'
     },
     operationType: 'insert',
     clusterTime: new Timestamp({ t: 1675800603, i: 31 }),
     fullDocument: {
       _id: new ObjectId("..."),
       ...
     },
     ns: { db: 'insertDB', coll: 'haikus' },
     documentKey: { _id: new ObjectId("...") }
   }

.. note:: Receive Full Documents From Updates

   Change events that contain information on update operations only return the modified
   fields by default rather than the full updated document. You can configure
   your change stream to also return the most current version of the document
   by setting the ``fullDocument`` field of the options object to
   ``"updateLookup"`` as follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :emphasize-lines: 1, 5

      const options = { fullDocument: "updateLookup" };
      // This could be any pipeline.
      const pipeline = [];

      const changeStream = myColl.watch(pipeline, options);

Listener Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example opens a change stream on the ``haikus`` collection in
the ``insertDB`` database. Let's create a listener function to receive and
print change events that occur on the collection.

First, open the change stream on the collection and then define a listener
on the change stream using the ``on()`` method. Once you set the
listener, generate a change event by performing a change to the collection.

To generate the change event on the collection, let's use the ``insertOne()``
method to add a new document. Since ``insertOne()`` may run before the
listener function can register, we use a timer, defined as
``simulateAsyncPause`` to wait 1 second before executing the insert.

We also use ``simulateAsyncPause`` after the insertion of the document.
This provides ample time for the listener function to receive the change
event and for the listener to complete its execution before
closing the ``ChangeStream`` instance using the ``close()`` method.

.. note:: Reason to include timers

   The timers used in this example are only for demonstration
   purposes. They make sure that there is enough time to register
   the listener and have the listener process the change event before
   exiting.
