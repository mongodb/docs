The ``AtlasIPAccessList`` custom resource configures an :ref:`IP
access list <access-list>` for an |service| project. An IP access list
allows you to secure your project using a minimum-access policy.

.. include:: /includes/fact-ak8so-crds.rst

|ak8so| does one of the following actions using the |service|
:oas-atlas-tag:`Project IP Access List API Resource
</Project-IP-Access-List>`:

- Creates a new IP access list.
- Replace an existing IP access list.

Examples
--------

.. _atlasipaccesslist-example-basic:

Basic Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example shows an ``AtlasIPAccessList`` custom resource
that permits access to the ``my-project`` project from the following
sources:

- CIDR block ``192.168.1.0/24``
- IP address ``10.0.0.1``
- :aws:`AWS security group
  <vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-groups>`

Access from ``10.0.0.1`` expires after the 31st of March, 2025.

.. code-block::

   apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
   kind: AtlasIPAccessList
   metadata:
     name: atlasipaccesslist-sample
   spec:
     projectRef:
       name: my-project
       namespace: my-operator-namespace
     entries:
       - cidrBlock: 192.168.1.0/24
       - ipAddress: 10.0.0.1
	 deleteAfterDate: 2025-03-31T23:59:59+02:00
       - awsSecurityGroup: sg-1234

Independent CRD Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example shows an ``AtlasIPAccessList`` :ref:`independent
CRD <ak8so-independent-crd>` that permits access from the same CIDR
block and IP address permitted by the :ref:`Basic Example
<atlasipaccesslist-example-basic>`. This custom resource definition
allows you to create an IP access list in a project you manage
outside the instance of |ak8so| with which you define this
resource. To enable independent operation, you must use an
``externalProjectRef`` instead of a ``projectRef``, and you must
supply a ``connectionSecret`` directly since this resource can't
inherit API credentials from its parent project.

.. code-block::

   apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
   kind: AtlasIPAccessList
   metadata:
     name: atlasipaccesslist-sample
   spec:
     externalProjectRef:
       projectId: 66e2f2b621571b7e69a89b66
     connectionSecret:
       name: atlas-connection-secret
     entries:
       - cidrBlock: 192.168.1.0/24
       - ipAddress: 10.0.0.1
	 deleteAfterDate: 2025-03-31T23:59:59+02:00

Parameters
----------

This section describes the ``AtlasIPAccessList`` custom resource parameters available. 

.. setting:: metadata.name

   *Type*: string

   *Required*

   Name that the :ref:`atlasipaccesslist-custom-resource` uses to add
   this IP access list to a project.

.. setting:: metadata.namespace

   *Type*: string

   *Optional*

   Namespace that you want to contain the ``atlasIPAccessList`` custom
   resource. If unspecified, |ak8so| uses the current namespace set by ``kubectl``.

.. setting:: spec.connectionSecret.name

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   Name of the opaque |k8s-secret| that contains the organization ID
   and :ref:`API keys <about-org-api-keys>` that |ak8so| uses to
   :ref:`connect <ak8so-access-to-atlas-ref>` to |service|.  If
   unspecified, |ak8so| defaults to one of the following options:

   - The ``spec.connectionSecretRef.name`` parameter of the parent
     ``atlasProject``
   - The default ``global`` secret, if ``spec.connectionSecretRef.name``
     is undefined for the parent ``atlasProject``

   This parameter is required for :ref:`independent CRDs
   <ak8so-independent-crd>`.
   
   .. include:: /includes/fact-ak8so-label-secret.rst

.. setting:: spec.entries

   *Type*: array

   *Required*

   Set of connection sources from which to permit access to the
   project.

.. setting:: spec.entries.[n].awsSecurityGroup

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   Unique identifier of the :aws:`AWS security group
   <vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-groups>` from which to grant
   access to the project.

   Each entry in ``spec.entries`` must have one and only one of
   ``awsSecurityGroup``, ``cidrBlock``, or ``ipAddress``.

.. setting:: spec.entries.[n].cidrBlock

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   Range of IP addresses in CIDR block notation from which to grant
   access to the project.

   Each entry in ``spec.entries`` must have one and only one of
   ``awsSecurityGroup``, ``cidrBlock``, or ``ipAddress``.

.. setting:: spec.entries.[n].comment

   *Type*: string

   *Optional*

   Comment associated with this access list entry.

.. setting:: spec.entries.[n].deleteAfterDate

   *Type*: string

   *Optional*

   Date and time after which |service| deletes the temporary access
   list entry.

   To create a permanent access list entry, omit this parameter.

.. setting:: spec.entries.[n].ipAddress

   *Type*: string

   *Optional*

   Single IP address from which to grant access to the project.

   Each entry in ``spec.entries`` must have one and only one of
   ``awsSecurityGroup``, ``cidrBlock``, or ``ipAddress``.

.. setting:: spec.externalProjectRef.id

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   ID of the project to which the IP access list belongs. You must
   specify the project ID of an existing :ref:`Atlas Project
   <manage-projects>`. This parameter is required for IP access lists
   that belong to projects managed by either:

   - A different instance of |ak8so|
   - Tooling other than |ak8so|

   For deployments that belong to projects managed by
   the same instance of |ak8so|, use ``spec.projectRef.name`` if you
   do not use ``spec.externalProjectRef.id``.

   An IP access list can belong to only one project. To define the
   same IP access list for multiple projects, create custom resource
   definitions for each project.

.. setting:: spec.projectRef.name

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   Name of the project to which the IP access list belongs. You must
   specify an existing :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource`. This
   parameter applies only to IP access lists that belong to projects
   managed by the same instance |ak8so|.

   For deployments that belong to projects managed by either:

   - a different instance of |ak8so|
   - tooling other than |ak8so|

   use ``spec.externalProjectRef.id``.

   An IP access list can belong only to one project. To define the
   same IP access list for multiple projects, create custom resource
   definitions for each project.

.. setting:: spec.projectRef.namespace

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   Namespace in which the :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource`
   specified in ``spec.projectRef.name`` exists.

   Do not set this parameter for deployments that belong to projects
   managed by either:

   - a different instance of |ak8so|
   - tooling other than |ak8so|
