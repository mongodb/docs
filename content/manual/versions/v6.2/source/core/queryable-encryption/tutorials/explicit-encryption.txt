Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to encrypt a document with {+manual-enc+}
and a MongoDB driver.

After completing this guide, you should be able to configure a driver to
encrypt fields in a document using {+manual-enc+}. With this knowledge,
you should be able to create a client application that uses {+manual-enc+}.
with automatic decryption.
