MongoDB with C#
===============

.. include:: /includes/docs-toc.rst
   
.. introduction::

   Leverage C# to develop applications based on the .NET framework. MongoDB provides
   both a .NET/C# driver and an Entity Framework integration for you to take advantage of
   using MongoDB in this general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language.

Driver
------

Provides a high-level API for working with MongoDB databases consistent with
other MongoDB language drivers and includes a LINQ provider for
.NET-native query access and powerful aggregation and transformation queries.

`C# Driver Documentation → <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/csharp/current/>`__

Frameworks and Integrations
---------------------------

The Entity Framework Core Provider allows you to use MongoDB with Microsoft's
Entity Framework Core as an object-relational mapper. You can
manipulate data by using LINQ queries and Entity Framework's entity-based
modeling and change tracking.

Integrate Atlas Vector Search with Microsoft Semantic Kernel to build AI
applications and implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Integrate MongoDB with your Microsoft .NET-based application by using the .NET
Aspire MongoDB Database Integration.
