``System CPU`` alerts indicate that the CPU usage of the MongoDB
process has reached a specified threshold. This threshold is specified
when the alert is created.

Alert Conditions
----------------

You can configure the following alert conditions in the project-level 
:ref:`alert settings <configure-alerts>` page to trigger alerts.

:alert:`System: CPU (Steal) % is` occurs when the CPU usage exceeds the 
guaranteed baseline CPU credit accumulation rate by the specified 
threshold. For more information on CPU credit accumulation, refer to 
the |aws| documentation for `Burstable Performance Instances
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html>`__.

.. note::

   The :alert:`System: CPU (Steal) % is` alert is applicable when
   the EC2 instance credit balance is exhausted. |service| triggers
   this alert only for AWS EC2 instances that support `Burstable
   Performance Instances
   <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html>`__.
   Currently, these are ``M10`` and ``M20`` cluster types.

:alert:`System: CPU (User) % is` occurs when the CPU usage of the 
MongoDB process, as normalized by the number of CPUs, exceeds the 
specified threshold.

Common Triggers
---------------

:manual:`Unoptimized queries </core/query-optimization/>` might lead to 
``System CPU`` alerts. Also, your current cluster tier might not 
support the current workload.

Fix the Immediate Problem
-------------------------

Consider adding one or more :manual:`indexes </indexes/>` to improve
query performance.

Implement a Long-Term Solution
------------------------------

Consider upgrading your cluster to a higher tier to
reduce the CPU usage percentage utilized by the current workload.
For more information on upgrading a cluster, see
:doc:`Modify a Cluster </scale-cluster>`.

Monitor Your Progress
---------------------

View the :guilabel:`Normalized System CPU` chart to monitor CPU usage 
of all processes on the node, scaled to a range of 0-100% by dividing 
by the number of CPU cores.
