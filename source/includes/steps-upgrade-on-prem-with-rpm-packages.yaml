  On RHEL, CentOS, SUSE12 hosts that use
  `systemd <https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd>`__, issue
  the following command to stop the |application|:

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo service mongodb-mms stop

  For platforms that use ``SysVInit``, issue the following command:

  .. code-block:: sh

  .. include:: /includes/fact-opsmanager-ha-start-upgrade-mode.rst

  To install the ``.rpm`` package on the upgraded |onprem| host, issue
  the following command, where ``<version>`` is the |onprem| version:

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo rpm -Uvh mongodb-mms-<version>.x86_64.rpm

  .. admonition:: RPM Upgrade to 4.1+ modifies |mms| ``mms.conf`` file
     :class: important

     If you :doc:`modified the ports </tutorial/manage-ports>` or the
     JVM settings that Ops Manager uses, you need to re-apply those
     changes to the ``mms.conf`` file after |onprem| is upgraded.

     The upgrade to |onprem| 4.1 and 4.2 removed the ``-d64`` flag from
     the ``JAVA_MMS_UI_OPTS`` parameter.

  When upgrading to |onprem| 4.4.11, |onprem| saves the current
  :file:`/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/conf-mms.properties` file as the
  :file:`/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/conf-mms.properties.rpmsave` file.
  To avoid having to manually reconfigure |onprem|, rename
  :file:`/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/conf-mms.properties.rpmsave`
  to :file:`/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/conf-mms.properties`:

     .. code-block:: sh

        sudo mv conf-mms.properties.rpmsave conf-mms.properties

  The following existing files block upgrading an |onprem| 4.2
  installation using RPM:

  - ``/etc/init.d/mongodb-mms``
  - ``/etc/init.d/mongodb-mms-backup-daemon``

  To complete the upgrade:

  a. Issue the following commands to move the old ``init`` files:

     .. code-block:: sh

        sudo mv /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms-4.0
        sudo mv /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms-backup-daemon /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms-backup-daemon-4.0

  #. Issue the following commands to symbollically link the |onprem|
     files to their ``init`` files:

     .. code-block:: sh

        sudo ln -s /opt/mongodb/mms/bin/mongodb-mms /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms
        sudo ln -s /opt/mongodb/mms/bin/mongodb-mms-backup-daemon /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms-backup-daemon
