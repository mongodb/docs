Change streams allow applications to access real-time data changes
without the complexity and risk of tailing the :term:`oplog`.
Applications can use change streams to subscribe to all data changes on
a single collection, a database, or an entire deployment, and
immediately react to them. Because change streams use the aggregation
framework, applications can also filter for specific changes or
transform the notifications at will.

Change stream is available for :doc:`replica sets <replication>` and
:doc:`sharded clusters </sharding>` that use :ref:`WiredTiger
<storage-wiredtiger>` storage engine and replica set protocol version 1
(:rsconf:`pv1 <protocolVersion>`). Change streams can also be used on
deployments which employ MongoDB's
:ref:`encryption-at-rest<encrypted-storage-engine>` feature.

Watch Collection/Database/Deployment
------------------------------------

You can open change streams against:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85

   * - Target
     - Description

   * - A collection

     - You can open a change stream cursor for a single collection
       (except ``system`` collections, or any collections in the
       ``admin``, ``local``, and ``config`` databases)

       The examples on this page use the MongoDB drivers to open and
       work with a change stream cursor for a single collection.

       .. seealso::

          The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method
          :method:`db.collection.watch()`

   * - A database

     - Starting in MongoDB 4.0, you can open a change stream cursor for
       a single database (excluding ``admin``, ``local``, and
       ``config`` database) to watch for changes to all its non-system
       collections.

       For the MongoDB driver
       method, refer to your driver documentation.

       .. seealso::

          The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method :method:`db.watch()`.


   * - A deployment
   
     - Starting in MongoDB 4.0, you can open a change stream cursor for
       a deployment (either a replica set or a sharded cluster) to
       watch for changes to all non-system collections across all
       databases except for ``admin``, ``local``, and ``config``.

       For the MongoDB driver method, refer to your driver
       documentation.

       .. seealso::

          The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method :method:`Mongo.watch()`.

.. admonition:: Change Stream Examples
   :class: note

   The examples on this page use the MongoDB drivers to illustrate how
   to open a change stream cursor for a collection and work with the
   change stream cursor.

.. _open-change-stream:

Open A Change Stream
--------------------

For a replica set, you can open change stream for any of the
data-bearing members.

For a sharded cluster, you must issue the open change stream operation
against the :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

The following example opens a change stream for a collection and iterates over the cursor to retrieve the 
change stream documents. As long as the connection to the MongoDB deployment remains open *and* the collection exists, 
this cursor remains open until it is explicitly closed.

Lookup Full Document for Update Operations
------------------------------------------

By default, change streams only return the delta of fields during the
update operation. However, you can configure the change stream to
return the most current majority-committed version of the updated
document.

         In the example below, all update operations notifications

   If there are one or more majority-committed operations that modified
   the updated document *after* the update operation but *before* the
   lookup, the full document returned may differ significantly from the
   document at the time of the update operation.

   However, the deltas included in the change stream document always
   correctly describe the watched collection changes that applied to
   that change stream event.

   See :ref:`change-stream-output` for more information on the change
   stream response document format.

Resume a Change Stream
----------------------

Change streams are resumable, as long as the oplog has enough history
to locate the last operation that the application received.

Each :ref:`change stream response document <change-stream-output>` has
an ``_id`` field that contains a document containing a resume token.
Passing the ``_id`` to the change stream attempts to resume
notifications starting at the operation specified.

         In the example below, ``$resumeToken`` contains the change
         stream notification id. The ``resumeAfter`` option takes a
         value that must resolve to a resume token. Passing the
         ``$resumeToken`` to the ``resumeAfter`` option directs the
         change stream to attempt to resume notifications starting at
         the operation specified in the resume token.

         In the example below, ``resume_token`` contains the change
         stream notification id. The ``resume_after`` modifier takes a
         parameter that must resolve to a resume token. Passing the
         ``resume_token`` to the ``resume_after`` modifier directs the
         change stream to attempt to resume notifications starting at
         the operation specified in the resume token.

As long as that operation has not rolled off the :term:`oplog`, the
change stream can successfully resume notifications.

Use Cases
---------

Change streams can benefit architectures with reliant business systems,
informing downstream systems once data changes are durable. For example,
change streams can save time for developers when implementing Extract,
Transform, and Load (ETL) services, cross-platform synchronization,
collaboration functionality, and notification services.

Access Control
--------------

For deployments enforcing :ref:`authentication` and :ref:`authorization
<authorization>`:

- To open a change stream against specific collection, applications
  must have privileges that grant :authaction:`changeStream` and
  :authaction:`find` actions on the corresponding collection.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { resource: { db: <dbname>, collection: <collection> }, actions: [ "find", "changeStream" ] }

- To open a change stream on a single databases, applications must have
  privileges that grant :authaction:`changeStream` and
  :authaction:`find` actions on all non-``system`` collections in a
  database.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { resource: { db: <dbname>, collection: "" }, actions: [ "find", "changeStream" ] }

- To open a change stream on an entire deployment, applications must
  have privileges that grant :authaction:`changeStream` and
  :authaction:`find` actions on all non-``system`` collections for all
  databases in the deployment.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { resource: { db: "", collection: "" }, actions: [ "find", "changeStream" ] }

Event Notification
------------------

Change streams only notify on data changes that have persisted to a majority
of data-bearing members in the replica set. This ensures that notifications are
triggered only by majority-committed changes that are durable in failure
scenarios.

For example, consider a 3-member :term:`replica set` with a change stream
cursor opened against the :term:`primary`. If a client issues an insert
operation, the change stream only notifies the application of the data change
once that insert has persisted to a majority of data-bearing members.

If an operation is associated with a :doc:`multi-document transactions
</core/transactions>`, the change event document includes the
``txnNumber`` and the ``lsid``.
