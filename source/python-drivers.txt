Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official MongoDB Python
drivers. Add one of the following drivers to your application to work with
MongoDB in Python.

PyMongo
-------

You can add PyMongo to your application to work with MongoDB in Python. See
the `PyMongo documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/languages/python/pymongo-driver/current/>`__
to learn how to install and begin using the driver.

`PyMongoArrow <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/languages/python/pymongo-arrow-driver/current/>`__
is a PyMongo extension for loading MongoDB query result sets as Apache Arrow tables.

Tools and Projects
------------------

The `Full Stack FastAPI App Generator <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/full-stack-fastapi-mongodb>`__
simplifies setup of web applications that use the FastAPI, React, and MongoDB
(FARM) stack. You can learn more about this tool on the
:website:`MongoDB blog. </blog/post/introducing-full-stack-fast-api-app-generator-for-python-developers>` 

.. important::

   The MongoDB Full Stack FastAPI App Generator is an experimental project
   and is not yet supported by MongoDB.
