|service| collects and displays metrics for your servers, databases,
and MongoDB processes. 

.. include:: /includes/fact-cluster-metrics.rst

.. note::

   The number of servers that |service| displays on the 
   :guilabel:`Metrics` page at any given time depends on the browser 
   screen size. Use the :guilabel:`Toggle Members` section to control 
   which servers |service| displays. Hover over the ``S`` and ``P`` 
   icons to find out which servers they represent.

Important Metrics
-----------------

You can monitor the following metrics to quickly gauge the health of 
your {+database-deployment+}.

   :header-rows: 1
        
   * - Chart

     - Description
  
   * - :guilabel:`Connections`

     - Number that indicates the total active connections to the 
       {+database-deployment+}.
       
       .. include:: /includes/fact-connections.rst

       To learn more, see :ref:`Fix Connection Issues 
       <connection-alerts>` and :ref:`Fix Lost Primary <no-primary>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Disk IOPS`
  
     - Number that indicates the input operations per second.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-disk-iops.rst

       To learn more, see :ref:`Fix IOPS Issues <disk-io-util>` and 
       :ref:`Fix Lost Primary <no-primary>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Disk Usage`
  
     - Number that indicates the total bytes of used disk space for the 
       cluster.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-disk-usage.rst

       To learn more, see :ref:`Fix Storage Issues <disk-space-used>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Query Targeting`
    
     - Number that indicates the efficiency of read operations run on   
       MongoDB.
       
       Monitor query targeting metrics to identify inefficent queries.

       To learn more, see :ref:`Fix Query Issues 
       <query-targeting-resolution>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Normalized System CPU`

     - Number that indicates CPU usage of all processes on the node, 
       scaled to a range of 0-100% by dividing by the number of CPU 
       cores.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-system-cpu.rst

       To learn more, see :ref:`Fix IOPS Issues <disk-io-util>`, 
       :ref:`Fix Lost Primary <no-primary>`, and :ref:`Fix CPU Usage 
       Issues <system-cpu>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Oplog GB/Hour`
     
     - Number that indicates the average rate in gigabytes of 
       :term:`oplog` data that the primary generates per hour.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-oplog-gb-hour.rst

       To learn more, see :ref:`Fix Oplog Issues 
       <replication-oplog-alerts>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Util %`

     - Percentage of time that requests are issued to and serviced 
       by disk. This metric includes requests from any process, not 
       just MongoDB processes.

       To learn more, see :ref:`Fix IOPS Issues <disk-io-util>`.

.. _monitoring-storage-granularity:

Monitoring Data Storage Granularity
-----------------------------------

|service| stores metrics data at increasing granularity levels. For each
increasing granularity level, |service| computes the metrics data based
on the averages from the previous granularity level. The length of
retention depends on the granularity. |service| computes the metrics 
data based on the averages from the previous granularity level.

|service| gathers metrics data at a 1-minute granularity unless you qualify for
premium monitoring.

.. example::

   After 48 hours' worth of data is collected, each group of
   60 minutes is compacted into a single unit of an hour. After 63 days,
   each group of 24 hours is compacted into a single unit of a day.

.. _premium-monitoring:

Premium Monitoring Granularity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have at least one {+cluster+} that's ``M40`` or larger, |service|
automatically enables premium monitoring for all {+clusters+} in the project. With
premium monitoring enabled, |service| gathers metrics data at a 10-second
granularity. Premium monitoring remains enabled for all {+clusters+} in the project until you
downgrade or terminate your last ``M40`` cluster.

.. note::

  Premium monitoring will become available in stages. If you have an ``M40``
  {+cluster+} or larger but don't see the premium monitoring granularity yet, you
  should see it soon.

Metrics Data Retention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| retains metrics data for a period of time that depends on the granularity of the data:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Data Period
     - Duration of Retention

   * - 10 seconds :icon-fa5:`star`
     - 8 hours :icon-fa5:`star`
  
   * - 1 minute
     - 48 hours

   * - 5 minutes
     - 48 hours

   * - 1 hour
     - 63 days

   * - 1 day
     - Forever

:icon-fa5:`star` :ref:`Premium monitoring <premium-monitoring>` only.

|service| retains all database-specific statistics. MongoDB log data is
retained at a maximum rate of 2000 lines per 2 minutes.

{+Free-Cluster+} and {+Shared-Cluster+} Monitoring Considerations
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- ``M0`` {+free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+shared-clusters+} support a subset of
  the metrics and charts available. For complete documentation on
  the limitations of ``M0/M2/M5`` {+clusters+},
  see :ref:`atlas-free-tier`.
  
- .. include:: /includes/fact-free-tier-monitoring-pause.rst

{+Serverless-Instance+} Monitoring Considerations
-------------------------------------------------

- {+Serverless-instances+} support a subset of the metrics and charts 
  available. For complete documentation on
  the limitations of {+serverless-instances+},
  see :doc:`/reference/serverless-instance-limitations/`.
