# Upgrade a Replica Set to 3.6

Note: MongoDB 3.6 is not tested on APFS, the new filesystem in macOS 10.13 and may encounter errors. 

Important: Before you attempt any upgrade, please familiarize yourself with the content of this document. 

If you need guidance on upgrading to 3.6, [MongoDB offers major version
upgrade services](https://www.mongodb.com/products/consulting?jmp=docs) to help ensure
a smooth transition without interruption to your MongoDB application.


## Upgrade Recommendations and Checklists

When upgrading, consider the following:


### Upgrade Version Path

To upgrade an existing MongoDB deployment to 3.6, you must be
running a 3.4-series release.

To upgrade from a version earlier than the 3.4-series, you must
successively upgrade major releases until you have upgraded to
3.4-series. For example, if you are running a 3.2-series, you must
upgrade first to [upgrade first to 3.4](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.4/#upgrade) *before* you can upgrade to 3.6.


### Preparedness

Before beginning your upgrade, see the [Compatibility Changes in MongoDB 3.6](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-compatibility) document to
ensure that your applications and deployments are compatible with
MongoDB 3.6. Resolve the incompatibilities in your deployment before
starting the upgrade.

Before upgrading MongoDB, always test your application in a staging
environment before deploying the upgrade to your production
environment.


### Downgrade Consideration

Once upgraded to 3.6, we recommend [downgrading](../3.6-downgrade-replica-set/) to the latest patch release of 3.4.


### Default Bind to Localhost

Starting in MongoDB 3.6, [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) and [``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos)
instances bind to localhost by default. Remote clients, including other
members of the replica set, cannot connect to an instance bound only to
localhost. To override and bind to other ip addresses, use the
[``net.bindIp``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.bindIp) configuration file setting or the ``--bind_ip``
command-line option to specify a list of ip addresses.

The upgrade process will require that you specify the
[``net.bindIp``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.bindIp) setting (or ``--bind_ip``) if your replica set
members are run on different hosts or if you wish remote clients to
connect to your replica set.

Warning: Before you bind to other ip addresses, consider [enabling access control](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/security-checklist/#checklist-auth) and other security measures listed in [Security Checklist](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/security-checklist) to prevent unauthorized access. 

For more information, see [Localhost Binding Compatibility Changes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-compatibility/#bind-ip-compatibility)


### Initial Syncs

Before starting the upgrade, ensure that no initial sync is in
progress. Performing the upgrade while an initial sync is in
progress will cause the initial sync to restart.


## Prerequisites

To upgrade a replica set to 3.6,

* All replica set members must be running version 3.4. To upgrade a replica set from an 3.2-series and earlier, *first* [upgrade all members of the replica set to the latest 3.4-series release](../3.4-upgrade-replica-set/), and then follow the procedure to upgrade from MongoDB 3.4 to 3.6. 

* The 3.4 replica set must have ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to ``3.4``. To check ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, see [View FeatureCompatibilityVersion](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/#view-fcv). To set or update ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, see [``setFeatureCompatibilityVersion``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/#dbcmd.setFeatureCompatibilityVersion). 

* Ensure that no replica set member is in [``ROLLBACK``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/replica-states/#replstate.ROLLBACK) or [``RECOVERING``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/replica-states/#replstate.RECOVERING) state. 


## Download 3.6 Binaries


### Via Package Manager

If you installed MongoDB from the MongoDB ``apt``, ``yum``, ``dnf``, or
``zypper`` repositories, you should upgrade to 3.6 using your package
manager.

Follow the appropriate [installation instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux) for your Linux system. This will
involve adding a repository for the new release, then performing the
actual upgrade process.


### Manually

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the [MongoDB Download
Center](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=docs).

See [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation) for more information.


## Upgrade Process

You can upgrade from MongoDB 3.4 to 3.6 using a
“rolling” upgrade to minimize downtime by upgrading the members
individually while the other members are available:


### Step 1: Upgrade secondary members of the replica set.

Upgrade the [secondary](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-members/#replica-set-secondary-members)
members of the replica set one at a time:

1. Shut down the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) instance and replace the 3.4 binary with the 3.6 binary. 

2. Restart the member. 

   Important: If your replica set members are run on different hosts or if you wish remote clients to connect to your instance, you must specify the [``net.bindIp``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.bindIp) setting (or ``--bind_ip``). For more information, see [Localhost Binding Compatibility Changes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-compatibility/#bind-ip-compatibility). 


### Step 2: Step down the replica set primary.

Connect a [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell to the primary and use
[``rs.stepDown()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.stepDown/#rs.stepDown) to step down the primary and force an
election of a new primary.


### Step 3: Upgrade the primary.

When [``rs.status()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.status/#rs.status)
shows that the primary has stepped down and another member
has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, upgrade the stepped-down primary:

1. Shut down the stepped-down primary and replace the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) binary with the 3.6 binary. 

2. Restart the member. 

   Important: If your replica set members are run on different hosts or if you wish remote clients to connect to your instance, you must specify the [``net.bindIp``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.bindIp) setting (or ``--bind_ip``). 


### Step 4: Enable backwards-incompatible 3.6 features.

At this point, you can run the 3.6 binaries without the
3.6 [features that are incompatible](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-compatibility/#compatibility-enabled) with 3.4.

To enable these 3.6 features, set the feature compatibility
version to 3.6.

Tip: Enabling these backwards-incompatible features can complicate the
downgrade process since you must remove any persisted
backwards-incompatible features before you downgrade. It is recommended that after upgrading, you allow your deployment to
run without enabling these features for a burn-in period to ensure
the likelihood of downgrade is minimal. When you are confident that
the likelihood of downgrade is minimal, enable these features.

Tip: Ensure that no initial sync is in progress. Running
[``setFeatureCompatibilityVersion``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/#dbcmd.setFeatureCompatibilityVersion) command while an initial
sync is in progress will cause the initial sync to restart.

On the primary, run the [``setFeatureCompatibilityVersion``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/#dbcmd.setFeatureCompatibilityVersion) command in the ``admin`` database:

```javascript

db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.6" } )

```

This command must perform writes to an internal system
collection. If for any reason the command does not complete
successfully, you can safely retry the command on the primary as
the operation is idempotent.
