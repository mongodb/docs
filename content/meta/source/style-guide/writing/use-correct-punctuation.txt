=======================
Use Correct Punctuation
=======================

When you use correct punctuation, you help users understand the content
*the first time* they read it. Following are a few basic guidelines to
apply:

-  Use a period at the end of sentences, even imperative ones (such as
   steps).
-  Use a comma before the last item in a series (known as the *serial*
   comma).
-  Use a comma to separate independent clauses, and include a
   coordinating conjunction (such as *and*).
-  Avoid using semicolons. You can almost always use a period in the
   place of a semicolon.
-  Don't use a slash (/) to present a choice among, or a series
   of, actions or objects. Rewrite the phrase to eliminate the slash
   mark. Exceptions are established terms like *client/server* and
   *read/write*.
-  Avoid using exclamation points, question marks, ellipses, or single
   quotation marks in regular text. Although these punctuation marks
   might appear in code elements, messages, literal commands, or UIs,
   they're rarely useful when writing descriptions or instructions for
   users. One exception is the use of question marks in FAQ topics.
