.. _x509-internal-authentication:

===================================================
Use x.509 Certificate for Membership Authentication
===================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 2.6

MongoDB supports x.509 certificate authentication for use with a secure
:doc:`SSL connection </tutorial/configure-ssl>`. Sharded cluster
members and replica set members can use x.509 certificates to
:ref:`verify their membership to the cluster or the replica set
<x509-internal-authentication>` instead of using :doc:`keyfiles
</core/authentication>`. The membership authentication is an internal
process.

For client authentication with x.509, see
:doc:`configure-x509-client-authentication`.

.. _x509-member-certificate:

Member x.509 Certificate
------------------------

The member certificate, used for internal authentication to verify
membership to the sharded cluster or a replica set, must have the
following properties:

- A single Certificate Authority (CA) must issue all the x.509
  certificates for the members of a sharded cluster or a replica set.

- The Distinguished Name (``DN``), found in the member certificate's
  ``subject``, must specify a non-empty value for *at least one* of the
  following attributes: Organization (``O``), the Organizational Unit
  (``OU``) or the Domain Component (``DC``).

- The Organization attributes (``O``\'s), the Organizational Unit
  attributes (``OU``\'s), and the Domain Components (``DC``\'s) must match
  those from the certificates for the other cluster members. To match,
  the certificate must match all specifications of these attributes, or
  even the non-specification of these attributes. The order of the
  attributes does not matter.

  In the following example, the two ``DN``\'s contain matching
  specifications for ``O``, ``OU`` as well as the non-specification of
  the ``DC`` attribute.

  .. code-block:: none

     CN=host1,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US
     C=US, ST=CA, O=MongoDB, OU=Dept1, CN=host2

  However, the following two ``DN``\'s contain a mismatch for the
  ``OU`` attribute since one contains two ``OU`` specifications and
  the other, only one specification.

  .. code-block:: none

     CN=host1,OU=Dept1,OU=Sales,O=MongoDB
     CN=host2,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB

- Either the Common Name (``CN``) or one of the Subject Alternative
  Name (``SAN``) entries must match the hostname of the server, used by
  the other members of the cluster.

  For example, the certificates for a cluster could have the following
  subjects:

  .. code-block:: sh

     subject= CN=<myhostname1>,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US
     subject= CN=<myhostname2>,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US
     subject= CN=<myhostname3>,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US


Configure Replica Set/Sharded Cluster
-------------------------------------

Use Command-line Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To specify the x.509 certificate for internal cluster member
authentication, append the additional SSL options
:option:`--clusterAuthMode` and :option:`--sslClusterFile`, as in the
following example for a member of a replica set:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --replSet <name> --sslMode requireSSL --clusterAuthMode x509 --sslClusterFile <path to membership certificate and key PEM file> --sslPEMKeyFile <path to SSL certificate and key PEM file> --sslCAFile <path to root CA PEM file>

Include any additional options, SSL or otherwise, that are required for
your specific configuration. For instance, if the membership key is
encrypted, set the :option:`--sslClusterPassword` to the passphrase to
decrypt the key or have MongoDB prompt for the passphrase. See
:ref:`ssl-certificate-password` for details.

Use Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may also specify these options in the :doc:`configuration file
</reference/configuration-options>`.

YAML Formatted Configuration File
`````````````````````````````````

Starting in MongoDB 2.6, you can specify the configuration for MongoDB
in a :doc:`YAML format </reference/configuration-options>`, as in the
following example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   security:
      clusterAuthMode: x509
   net:
      ssl:
         mode: requireSSL
         PEMKeyFile: <path to SSL certificate and key PEM file>
         CAFile: <path to root CA PEM file>
         clusterFile: <path to x.509 membership certificate and key PEM file>

See :setting:`security.clusterAuthMode`, :setting:`net.ssl.mode`,
:setting:`net.ssl.PEMKeyFile`, :setting:`net.ssl.CAFile`, and
:setting:`net.ssl.clusterFile` for more information on the settings.

v2.4 Configuration File
```````````````````````

For backwards compatibility, you can also specify the configuration
using the :v2.4:`v2.4 configuration file format
</reference/configuration>`, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: ini

   sslMode = requireSSL
   sslPEMKeyFile = <path to SSL certificate and key PEM file>
   sslCAFile = <path to root CA PEM file>
   clusterAuthMode = x509
   sslClusterFile = <path to membership certificate and key PEM file>

.. _upgrade-to-x509-internal-authentication:

Upgrade from Keyfile Authentication to x.509 Authentication
-----------------------------------------------------------

To upgrade clusters that are currently using keyfile authentication to
x.509 authentication, use a rolling upgrade process.

Clusters Currently Using SSL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For clusters using SSL and keyfile authentication, to upgrade to x.509
cluster authentication, use the following rolling upgrade process:

#. For each node of a cluster, start the node with the option
   :option:`--clusterAuthMode` set to ``sendKeyFile`` and the option
   :option:`--sslClusterFile` set to the appropriate path of the node's
   certificate. Include other :doc:`SSL options
   </tutorial/configure-ssl>` as well as any other options that are
   required for your specific configuration. For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --replSet <name> --sslMode requireSSL --clusterAuthMode sendKeyFile --sslClusterFile <path to membership certificate and key PEM file> --sslPEMKeyFile <path to SSL Certificate and key PEM file>  --sslCAFile <path to root CA PEM file>

   With this setting, each node continues to use its keyfile to
   authenticate itself as a member. However, each node can now accept
   either a keyfile or an x.509 certificate from other members to
   authenticate those members. Upgrade all nodes of the cluster to
   this setting.

#. Then, for each node of a cluster, connect to the node and use the
   :dbcommand:`setParameter` command to update the :parameter:`clusterAuthMode`
   to ``sendX509``. [#update-mode-alternative]_ For example,

   .. code-block:: sh

      db.getSiblingDB('admin').runCommand( { setParameter: 1, clusterAuthMode: "sendX509" } )

   With this setting, each node uses its x.509 certificate, specified
   with the :option:`--sslClusterFile` option in the previous step, to
   authenticate itself as a member. However, each node continues to
   accept either a keyfile or an x.509 certificate from other members
   to authenticate those members. Upgrade all nodes of the cluster to
   this setting.

#. Optional but recommended. Finally, for each node of the cluster,
   connect to the node and use the :dbcommand:`setParameter` command to
   update the :parameter:`clusterAuthMode` to ``x509`` to only use the
   x.509 certificate for authentication. [#update-mode-alternative]_
   For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      db.getSiblingDB('admin').runCommand( { setParameter: 1, clusterAuthMode: "x509" } )

#. After the upgrade of all nodes, edit the :doc:`configuration file
   </reference/configuration-options>` with the appropriate x.509
   settings to ensure that upon subsequent restarts, the cluster uses
   x.509 authentication.

See :option:`--clusterAuthMode` for the various modes and their
descriptions.

Clusters Currently Not Using SSL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For clusters using keyfile authentication but not SSL, to upgrade to
x.509 authentication, use the following rolling upgrade process:

#. For each node of a cluster, start the node with the option
   :option:`--sslMode` set to ``allowSSL``, the option
   :option:`--clusterAuthMode` set to ``sendKeyFile`` and the option
   :option:`--sslClusterFile` set to the appropriate path of the node's
   certificate. Include other :doc:`SSL options
   </tutorial/configure-ssl>` as well as any other options that are
   required for your specific configuration. For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --replSet <name> --sslMode allowSSL --clusterAuthMode sendKeyFile --sslClusterFile <path to membership certificate and key PEM file> --sslPEMKeyFile <path to SSL certificate and key PEM file>  --sslCAFile <path to root CA PEM file>

   The :option:`--sslMode allowSSL <--sslMode>` setting allows the
   node to accept both SSL and non-SSL incoming connections. Its
   outgoing connections do not use SSL.

   The :option:`--clusterAuthMode sendKeyFile <--clusterAuthMode>`
   setting allows each node continues to use its keyfile to
   authenticate itself as a member. However, each node can now accept
   either a keyfile or an x.509 certificate from other members to
   authenticate those members.

   Upgrade all nodes of the cluster to these settings.

#. Then, for each node of a cluster, connect to the node and use the
   :dbcommand:`setParameter` command to update the :parameter:`sslMode`
   to ``preferSSL`` and the :parameter:`clusterAuthMode` to
   ``sendX509``. [#update-mode-alternative]_ For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      db.getSiblingDB('admin').runCommand( { setParameter: 1, sslMode: "preferSSL", clusterAuthMode: "sendX509" } )

   With the :parameter:`sslMode` set to ``preferSSL``, the node accepts
   both SSL and non-SSL incoming connections, and its outgoing
   connections use SSL.

   With the :parameter:`clusterAuthMode` set to ``sendX509``, each node
   uses its x.509 certificate, specified with the
   :option:`--sslClusterFile` option in the previous step, to
   authenticate itself as a member. However, each node continues to
   accept either a keyfile or an x.509 certificate from other members
   to authenticate those members.

   Upgrade all nodes of the cluster to these settings.

#. Optional but recommended. Finally, for each node of the cluster,
   connect to the node and use the :dbcommand:`setParameter` command to
   update the :parameter:`sslMode` to ``requireSSL`` and the
   :parameter:`clusterAuthMode` to ``x509``. [#update-mode-alternative]_
   For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      db.getSiblingDB('admin').runCommand( { setParameter: 1, sslMode: "requireSSL", clusterAuthMode: "x509" } )

   With the :parameter:`sslMode` set to ``requireSSL``, the node only uses
   SSL connections.

   With the :parameter:`clusterAuthMode` set to ``x509``, the node only
   uses the x.509 certificate for authentication.

#. After the upgrade of all nodes, edit the :doc:`configuration file
   </reference/configuration-options>` with the appropriate SSL and
   x.509 settings to ensure that upon subsequent restarts, the cluster
   uses x.509 authentication.

See :option:`--clusterAuthMode` for the various modes and their
descriptions.

.. [#update-mode-alternative] As an alternative to using the
   :dbcommand:`setParameter` command, you can also
   restart the nodes with the appropriate SSL and x509 options and
   values.
