:driver:`Drivers </>`. For a list of drivers and links to
driver documentation, see :driver:`Drivers </>`.

Connection String Formats
-------------------------

You can specify the MongoDB connection string using either:

- the :ref:`connections-standard-connection-string-format` or 

- the :ref:`connections-dns-seedlist`.


.. _connections-standard-connection-string-format:

Standard Connection String Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the standard format of the MongoDB connection
URI used to connect to a MongoDB deployment: standalone, replica set,
or a sharded cluster.

The standard URI connection scheme has the form:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,...hostN[:portN]][/[defaultauthdb][?options]]

Examples
````````

.. tabs::

   tabs:

      - id: standalone
        name: Standalone
        content: |

           - For a standalone:

             .. code-block:: bash

                mongodb://mongodb0.example.com:27017

           - For a standalone that :doc:`enforces access control
             </tutorial/enable-authentication>`:

             .. code-block:: bash

                mongodb://myDBReader:D1fficultP%40ssw0rd@mongodb0.example.com:27017/?authSource=admin

             .. include:: /includes/fact-pct-encode-uri.rst

      - id: repl
        name: Replica Set
        content: |

           .. note::

              .. include:: /includes/fact-uri-rs-hostnames.rst

              For a replica set, include the :urioption:`replicaSet`
              option.

           - For a replica set:

             .. code-block:: bash

                mongodb://mongodb0.example.com:27017,mongodb1.example.com:27017,mongodb2.example.com:27017/?replicaSet=myRepl
            
           - For a replica set that :doc:`enforces access control
             </tutorial/enable-authentication>`, include
             user credentials:

             .. code-block:: bash

                mongodb://myDBReader:D1fficultP%40ssw0rd@mongodb0.example.com:27017,mongodb1.example.com:27017,mongodb2.example.com:27017/?authSource=admin&replicaSet=myRepl

             .. include:: /includes/fact-pct-encode-uri.rst

      - id: sharded
        name: Sharded Cluster
        content: |

           .. note::

              For a connection string to a sharded cluster, specify
              :binary:`~bin.mongos` hosts in the connection string.

           - For a sharded cluster:

             .. code-block:: bash

                mongodb://mongos0.example.com:27017,mongos1.example.com:27017,mongos2.example.com:27017

           - For a sharded cluster that :doc:`enforces access
             control </tutorial/enable-authentication>`, include
             user credentials:

             .. code-block:: bash

                mongodb://myDBReader:D1fficultP%40ssw0rd@mongos0.example.com:27017,mongos1.example.com:27017,mongos2.example.com:27017/?authSource=admin

             .. include:: /includes/fact-pct-encode-uri.rst

      - id: atlas
        name: Atlas Deployment
        content: |

           MongoDB Atlas provides the connection strings for 
           your deployment when you click the :atlas:`Connect
           </connect-to-database-deployment/>` button in the Atlas UI. 
           To register a new Atlas account, start at the 
           `MongoDB Atlas registration page 
           <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register?tck=docs_server_connection_cta>`__. To learn more, see
           :atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started/>`.

           Your Atlas connection string might resemble the following 
           example:

           .. code-block:: bash

              mongosh "mongodb+srv://cluster0.example.mongodb.net myFirstDatabase" --username JohnDoe

For more examples, see :ref:`connections-connection-examples`.

Components
``````````

The standard URI connection string includes the following components:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Component
     - Description

   * - ``mongodb://``

     - A required prefix to identify that this is a string in the
       standard connection format.

   * - ``username:password@``

     - Optional. Authentication credentials. 
     
       If specified, the client will attempt to authenticate the
       user to the :urioption:`authSource`. If
       :urioption:`authSource` is unspecified, the client will
       attempt to authenticate the user to the ``defaultauthdb``.
       And if the ``defaultauthdb`` is unspecified, to the ``admin``
       database.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-pct-encode-uri.rst

       See also :urioption:`authSource`.

   * - ``host[:port]``

     - The host (and optional port number) where the
       :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance (or :binary:`~bin.mongos`
       instance for a sharded cluster) is running. You can specify a
       hostname, IP address, or UNIX domain socket. Specify as many
       hosts as appropriate for your deployment topology:

       - For a standalone, specify the hostname of the standalone
         :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

       - .. include:: /includes/fact-uri-rs-hostnames.rst

       - For a sharded cluster, specify the hostname(s) of the
         :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance(s).

       If the port number is not specified, the default port ``27017``
       is used.


   * - ``/defaultauthdb``
     
     - Optional. The authentication database to use if the
       connection string includes ``username:password@``
       authentication credentials but the :urioption:`authSource` option
       is unspecified.

       If both :urioption:`authSource` and ``defaultauthdb`` are
       unspecified, the client will attempt to authenticate the
       specified user to the ``admin`` database.

   * - ``?<options>``

     - Optional. A query string that specifies connection specific
       options as ``<name>=<value>`` pairs. See
       :ref:`connections-connection-options` for a full description of
       these options.

       If the connection string does not specify a database/ you must
       specify a slash (``/``) between the last ``host`` and the
       question mark (``?``) that begins the string of options.

.. _connections-dns-seedlist:

DNS Seed List Connection Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the standard connection format, MongoDB supports a
:abbr:`DNS (Domain Name Service)`-constructed :term:`seed list`. Using 
DNS to construct the available servers list allows more flexibility of
deployment and the ability to change the servers in rotation without
reconfiguring clients.

In order to leverage the DNS seed list, use a connection string prefix of
``mongodb+srv`` rather than the standard ``mongodb``. The ``+srv``
indicates to the client that the hostname that follows corresponds to a
DNS SRV record. The driver or :binary:`~bin.mongosh` will then
query the DNS for the record to determine which hosts are running the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

.. note::

   Use of the ``+srv`` connection string modifier
   automatically sets the :urioption:`tls` (or the equivalent
   :urioption:`ssl`) option to ``true`` for the connection. You can
   override this behavior by explicitly setting the :urioption:`tls`
   (or the equivalent :urioption:`ssl`) option to ``false`` with
   ``tls=false`` (or ``ssl=false``) in the query string.

The following example shows a typical connection string for a DNS
:term:`seed list` connection string:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb+srv://server.example.com/

The corresponding DNS configuration might resemble:

.. code-block:: none

   Record                            TTL   Class    Priority Weight Port  Target
   _mongodb._tcp.server.example.com. 86400 IN SRV   0        5      27317 mongodb1.example.com.
   _mongodb._tcp.server.example.com. 86400 IN SRV   0        5      27017 mongodb2.example.com.

When a client connects to a member of the :term:`seed list`, the client 
retrieves a list of replica set members it can connect to. Clients 
often use DNS aliases in their seed lists which means the host may
return a server list that differs from the original seed list. If this
happens, clients will use the hostnames provided by the replica set 
rather than the hostnames listed in the seed list to ensure that 
replica set members can be reached via the hostnames in the resulting
replica set config. 

.. important::

   The hostnames returned in SRV records must share the same parent
   domain (in this example, ``example.com``) as the given hostname. If
   the parent domains and hostname do not match, you will not be able to
   connect.

Like the standard connection string, the DNS seed list connection string
supports specifying options as a query string. With a DNS seed list
connection string, you can *also* specify the following options via a
TXT record:

- ``replicaSet``
- ``authSource``

You may only specify one TXT record per :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.
If multiple TXT records appear in the DNS and/or if the TXT
record contains an option other than ``replicaSet`` or ``authSource``,
the client will return an error.

The TXT record for the ``server.example.com`` DNS entry would resemble:

.. code-block:: none

   Record              TTL   Class    Text
   server.example.com. 86400 IN TXT   "replicaSet=mySet&authSource=authDB"

Taken together, the DNS SRV records and the options specified in the TXT
record resolve to the following standard format connection string:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://mongodb1.example.com:27317,mongodb2.example.com:27017/?replicaSet=mySet&authSource=authDB

You can override the options specified in a TXT record by passing the option
in the query string. In the following example, the query string has provided
an override for the ``authSource`` option configured in the TXT record
of the DNS entry above.

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb+srv://server.example.com/?connectTimeoutMS=300000&authSource=aDifferentAuthDB

Given the override for the ``authSource``, the equivalent connection
string in the standard format would be:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://mongodb1.example.com:27317,mongodb2.example.com:27017/?connectTimeoutMS=300000&replicaSet=mySet&authSource=aDifferentAuthDB

.. note::
   The ``mongodb+srv`` option will fail if there is no available DNS
   with records that correspond to the hostname identified in the
   connection string. In addition, use of the ``+srv`` connection string modifier
   automatically sets the :urioption:`tls` (or the equivalent
   :urioption:`ssl`) option to ``true`` for the connection. You can
   override this behavior by explicitly setting the :urioption:`tls`
   (or the equivalent :urioption:`ssl`) option to ``false`` with
   ``tls=false`` (or ``ssl=false``) in the query string.

.. see::

   :ref:`example-connect-mongo-using-srv` provides an example of
   connecting :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to a replica set using
   the DNS Seed list Connection Format.


.. _connections-connection-options:

Connection String Options
-------------------------

This section lists all connection options.

Connection options are pairs in the following form: ``name=value``.

- The option ``name`` is case insensitive when using a driver.

- The option ``name`` is case insensitive when using
  :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, or the version 4.2 or later legacy
  :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

- The option ``name`` is case sensitive when using a version 4.0 and
  earlier legacy :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

- The ``value`` is always case sensitive.

Separate options with the ampersand (i.e. ``&``) character
``name1=value1&name2=value2``. In the following example, a
connection includes the :urioption:`replicaSet` and
:urioption:`connectTimeoutMS` options:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://db1.example.net:27017,db2.example.net:2500/?replicaSet=test&connectTimeoutMS=300000

.. note:: Semi-colon separator for connection string arguments

   To provide backwards compatibility, drivers currently accept
   semi-colons (i.e. ``;``) as option separators.

.. _replica-set-option:

Replica Set Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following connection string to a replica set named ``myRepl`` with
members running on the specified hosts:

.. code-block:: bash

   mongodb://db0.example.com:27017,db1.example.com:27017,db2.example.com:27017/?replicaSet=myRepl

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: replicaSet

     - Specifies the name of the :term:`replica set`, if the
       :binary:`~bin.mongod` is a member of a replica set.

       When connecting to a replica set, provide a :term:`seed list` of 
       the replica set member(s) to the ``host[:port]`` component of the
       uri. For specific details, refer to your :driver:`driver </>` 
       documentation.

Connection Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _uri-options-tls:

TLS Options
```````````

The following connection string to a replica set includes 
:urioption:`tls=true <tls>` option (available starting in MongoDB 4.2):

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://db0.example.com,db1.example.com,db2.example.com/?replicaSet=myRepl&tls=true

Alternatively, you can also use the equivalent :urioption:`ssl=true
<ssl>` option:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://db0.example.com,db1.example.com,db2.example.com/?replicaSet=myRepl&ssl=true

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: tls

     - Enables or disables TLS/SSL for the connection:

       - ``true``: Initiate the connection with TLS/SSL. Default for
         :ref:`connections-dns-seedlist`.

       - ``false``: Initiate the connection without TLS/SSL. Default for
         :ref:`connections-standard-connection-string-format`.

       .. note::

          The :urioption:`tls` option is equivalent to the
          :urioption:`ssl` option.

       If the :binary:`mongo` shell specifies additional
       :ref:`tls/ssl <mongo-shell-tls>` options from the
       command-line, use the :option:`--tls <mongosh --tls>`
       command-line option instead.
       
       .. versionadded:: 4.2

   * - .. urioption:: ssl

     - A boolean to enable or disables TLS/SSL for the connection:
  
       - ``true``: Initiate the connection with TLS/SSL. Default for
         :ref:`connections-dns-seedlist`.
      
       - ``false``: Initiate the connection without TLS/SSL. Default
         for :ref:`connections-standard-connection-string-format`.

       .. note::

          The :urioption:`ssl` option is equivalent to the
          :urioption:`tls` option.

       If the :binary:`mongo` shell specifies additional
       :ref:`tls/ssl <mongo-shell-ssl>` options from the
       command-line, use the ``--ssl``
       command-line option instead.

   * - .. urioption:: tlsCertificateKeyFile

     - Specifies the location of a local :file:`.pem` file that
       contains either the client's TLS/SSL X.509 certificate or the
       client's TLS/SSL certificate and key.

       The client presents this file to the
       :binary:`~bin.mongod`/:binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

       .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-certificate-expiry-warning.rst

       .. versionadded:: 4.2

   * - .. urioption:: tlsCAFile

     - Specifies the location of a local :file:`.pem` file that
       contains the root certificate chain from the Certificate
       Authority. This file is used to validate the certificate
       presented by the :binary:`~bin.mongod`/:binary:`~bin.mongos`
       instance.

       This option is not supported by all drivers. Refer to the
       :driver:`Drivers </>` documentation.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-uri-option-availability.rst

       .. versionadded:: 4.2

   * - .. urioption:: tlsAllowInvalidCertificates
   
     - Bypasses validation of the certificates presented by the
       :binary:`~bin.mongod`/:binary:`~bin.mongos` instance

       Set to ``true`` to connect to MongoDB instances even if the
       server's present invalid certificates.

       This option is not supported by all drivers. Refer to the
       :driver:`Drivers </>` documentation.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-uri-option-availability.rst

       .. warning::

   * - .. urioption:: tlsAllowInvalidHostnames

     - Disables hostname validation of the certificate presented by
       the :binary:`~bin.mongod`/:binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

       Set to ``true`` to connect to MongoDB instances even if the
       hostname in the server certificates do not match the server's
       host.

       This option is not supported by all drivers. Refer to the

Timeout Options
````````````````

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: connectTimeoutMS

     - The time in milliseconds to attempt a connection before timing
       out. The default is never to timeout, though different drivers
       might vary. See the :driver:`driver </>`
       documentation.

   * - .. urioption:: socketTimeoutMS

     - The time in milliseconds to attempt a send or receive on a
       socket before the attempt times out. The default is never to
       timeout, though different drivers might vary. See the
       :driver:`driver </>` documentation.

Compression Options
```````````````````

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: compressors

     - Comma-delimited string of compressors to enable
       network compression for communication between this
       client and a :binary:`~bin.mongod`/:binary:`~bin.mongos`
       instance.

       You can specify the following compressors:	

       - :term:`snappy`

       - :term:`zlib` (Available in MongoDB 3.6 or greater)

       - :term:`zstd` (Available in MongoDB 4.2 or greater)

       If you specify multiple compressors, then the order in which you list
       the compressors matter as well as the communication initiator. For
       example, if the client specifies the following network
       compressors ``"zlib,snappy"`` and the :binary:`~bin.mongod` specifies
       ``"snappy,zlib"``, messages between the client and the
       :binary:`~bin.mongod` uses ``zlib``.

       .. important::

          Messages are compressed when both parties enable network
          compression. Otherwise, messages between the parties are
          uncompressed.

          If the parties do not share at least one common compressor,
          messages between the parties are uncompressed.

       :binary:`~bin.mongosh` supports the uri connection string
       option :urioption:`compressors`.

   * - .. urioption:: zlibCompressionLevel

     - An integer that specifies the compression level if using
       :term:`zlib` for :urioption:`network compression <compressors>`.

       You can specify an integer value ranging from ``-1`` to ``9``:

       .. list-table::
          :header-rows: 1
          :widths: 25 75

          * - Value
            - Notes

          * - ``-1``

            - Default compression level, usually level ``6`` compression.

          * - ``0``
            - No compression

          * - ``1`` - ``9``

            - Increasing level of compression but at the cost of speed, with:

              - ``1`` providing the best speed but least compression, and

              - ``9`` providing the best compression but at the slowest speed.

       Not supported by :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.

.. _connection-pool-options:

Connection Pool Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most drivers implement some kind of connection pool handling.
Some drivers do not support connection
pools. See your :driver:`driver </>` documentation
for more information on the connection pooling implementation. These
options allow applications to configure the connection pool when
connecting to the MongoDB deployment.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: maxPoolSize

     - The maximum number of connections in the connection pool. The
       default value is ``100``.

   * - .. urioption:: minPoolSize

     - The minimum number of connections in the connection pool. The
       default value is ``0``.

       .. note::
          The :urioption:`minPoolSize` option is not supported by all
          drivers. For information on your driver, see the
          :driver:`Drivers </>` documentation.

   * - .. urioption:: maxIdleTimeMS

     - The maximum number of milliseconds that a connection can remain
       idle in the pool before being removed and closed.

       This option is not supported by all drivers.

   * - .. urioption:: waitQueueMultiple

     - A number that the driver multiplies the :urioption:`maxPoolSize`
       value to, to provide the maximum number of threads allowed to
       wait for a connection to become available from the pool. For
       default values, see the :driver:`driver </>`
       documentation.

       This option is not supported by all drivers.

   * - .. urioption:: waitQueueTimeoutMS

     - The maximum time in milliseconds that a thread can wait for a
       connection to become available. For default values, see the
       :driver:`driver </>` documentation.

       This option is not supported by all drivers.

.. _connections-write-concern:

Write Concern Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Write concern <write-concern>` describes the level of
acknowledgment requested from MongoDB. The write concern option is
supported by the:

- MongoDB drivers

- :binary:`~bin.mongosh`

- :binary:`~bin.mongofiles`

- :binary:`~bin.mongoimport`

- :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`

You can specify the write concern both in the connection string and
as a parameter to methods like ``insert`` or ``update``. If the
write concern is specified in both places, the method parameter
overrides the connection-string setting.

The following connection string to a replica set specifies
:writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern and a 5 second
timeout using the :urioption:`wtimeoutMS` write concern parameter:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://db0.example.com,db1.example.com,db2.example.com/?replicaSet=myRepl&w=majority&wtimeoutMS=5000

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: w

     - Corresponds to the write concern :ref:`wc-w`. The ``w`` option
       requests acknowledgement that the write operation has propagated
       to a specified number of :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances or to
       :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances with specified tags.

       You can specify a :writeconcern:`number <\<number\>>`, the
       string :writeconcern:`majority <"majority">`, or a
       :writeconcern:`tag set <\<custom write concern name\>>`.

       For details, see :ref:`wc-w`.

   * - .. urioption:: wtimeoutMS

     - Corresponds to the write concern :ref:`wc-wtimeout`.
       :urioption:`wtimeoutMS` specifies a time limit, in milliseconds,
       for the write concern.

       When ``wtimeoutMS`` is ``0``, write operations will never time
       out. For more information, see :ref:`wc-wtimeout`.

   * - .. urioption:: journal

     - Corresponds to the write concern :ref:`wc-j` option. The
       :urioption:`journal` option requests acknowledgement from
       MongoDB that the write operation has been written to the
       :doc:`journal </core/journaling>`. For details, see :ref:`wc-j`.

       If you set :urioption:`journal` to ``true``, and specify a
       :urioption:`w` value less than 1, :urioption:`journal` prevails.

       If you set :urioption:`journal` to true, and the
       :binary:`~bin.mongod` does not have journaling enabled, as with
       :setting:`storage.journal.enabled`, then MongoDB will error.

For more information, see :doc:`/reference/write-concern`.

``readConcern`` Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the WiredTiger storage engine, MongoDB 3.2 introduces the
readConcern option for replica sets and replica set shards.

:doc:`/reference/read-concern` allows clients to choose a level of
isolation for their reads from replica sets.

The following connection string to a replica set specifies
:urioption:`readConcernLevel=majority <readConcernLevel>`:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://db0.example.com,db1.example.com,db2.example.com/?replicaSet=myRepl&readConcernLevel=majority

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: readConcernLevel

     - The level of isolation. Can accept one of the following values:

       - :readconcern:`local <"local">`
       - :readconcern:`majority <"majority">`
       - :readconcern:`linearizable <"linearizable">`
       - :readconcern:`available <"available">`

       This connection string option is not available for
       :binary:`~bin.mongosh`. Specify the read concern as an
       :ref:`option to the specific operation
       <read-concern-operations>`.

For more information, see :doc:`/reference/read-concern`.

.. _connections-read-preference:

Read Preference Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`Read preferences </core/read-preference>` describe the
behavior of read operations with regards to :term:`replica sets
<replica set>`. These parameters allow you to specify read preferences
on a per-connection basis in the connection string.

.. note::

   To specify the hedged reads option using the drivers, refer to the
   :driver:`drivers' read preference API </>`.

For example:

- The following connection string to a replica set specifies
  :readmode:`secondary` read preference mode and a
  :urioption:`maxStalenessSeconds` value of 120 seconds:

  .. code-block:: none

     mongodb://db0.example.com,db1.example.com,db2.example.com/?replicaSet=myRepl&readPreference=secondary&maxStalenessSeconds=120

- The following connection string to a sharded cluster specifies
  :readmode:`secondary` read preference mode and a
  :urioption:`maxStalenessSeconds` value of 120 seconds:

  .. code-block:: none

     mongodb://mongos1.example.com,mongos2.example.com/?readPreference=secondary&maxStalenessSeconds=120

- The following connection string to a sharded cluster specifies
  :readmode:`secondary` read preference mode as well as three
  :urioption:`readPreferenceTags`:

  .. code-block:: none

     mongodb://mongos1.example.com,mongos2.example.com/?readPreference=secondary&readPreferenceTags=dc:ny,rack:r1&readPreferenceTags=dc:ny&readPreferenceTags=

Order matters when using multiple ``readPreferenceTags``. The
``readPreferenceTags`` are tried in order until a match is found. Once
found, that specification is used to find all eligible matching
members and any remaining ``readPreferenceTags``  are ignored.
For details, see :ref:`read-preference-tag-order-matching`.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: readPreference

     - Specifies the :doc:`read preferences </core/read-preference>`
       for this connection. Possible values are:

       - :readmode:`primary` (*Default*)
       - :readmode:`primaryPreferred`
       - :readmode:`secondary`
       - :readmode:`secondaryPreferred`
       - :readmode:`nearest`

       .. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-read-pref.rst

       This connection string option is not available for the
       :binary:`mongo` shell. See :method:`cursor.readPref()` and
       :method:`Mongo.setReadPref()` instead.

   * - .. urioption:: maxStalenessSeconds

     - Specifies, in seconds, how stale a secondary can be before the client
       stops using it for read operations. For details, see
       :ref:`replica-set-read-preference-max-staleness`.

       By default, there is no maximum staleness and clients will not consider a
       secondary's lag when choosing where to direct a read operation.

       The minimum :urioption:`maxStalenessSeconds` value is 90
       seconds. Specifying a value between 0 and 90 seconds will produce
       an error. MongoDB drivers treat a ``maxStalenessSeconds`` value
       of ``-1`` as "no max staleness", the same as if
       ``maxStalenessSeconds`` is omitted.

       .. important::
          To use ``maxStalenessSeconds``, all of the
          MongoDB instances in your deployment must be using MongoDB 3.4 or
          later. If any instances are on an earlier version of MongoDB, the
          driver or :binary:`~bin.mongod`/:binary:`~bin.mongos` will raise an error.

   * - .. urioption:: readPreferenceTags

     - Specifies the :ref:`tags document
       <replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>` as a comma-separated
       list of colon-separated key-value pairs. For example,
       
       - To specify the tags document ``{ "dc": "ny", "rack": "r1" }``,
         use ``readPreferenceTags=dc:ny,rack:r1`` in the connection
         string.
         
       - To specify an empty tags document ``{ }``, use
         ``readPreferenceTags=`` without setting the value.

       To specify a *list* of tag documents, use multiple
       ``readPreferenceTags``. For example,
       ``readPreferenceTags=dc:ny,rack:r1&readPreferenceTags=``.

       Order matters when using multiple ``readPreferenceTags``. The
       ``readPreferenceTags`` are tried in order until a match is
       found. For details, see
       :ref:`read-preference-tag-order-matching`.
       
       This connection string option is not available for the
       :binary:`mongo` shell. See :method:`cursor.readPref()` and
       :method:`Mongo.setReadPref()` instead.

For more information, see :doc:`Read preferences </core/read-preference>`.

.. _connection-string-auth-options:

Authentication Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following connection string to a replica set specifies the
:urioption:`authSource` to the ``admin`` database. That is, the user
credentials are authenticated against the ``admin`` database.

.. code-block:: bash

   mongodb://myDBReader:D1fficultP%40ssw0rd@mongodb0.example.com:27017,mongodb1.example.com:27017,mongodb2.example.com:27017/?replicaSet=myRepl&authSource=admin

.. include:: /includes/fact-pct-encode-uri.rst

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: authSource

     - Specify the database name associated with the user's
       credentials. If :urioption:`authSource` is unspecified,
       :urioption:`authSource` defaults to the ``defaultauthdb``
       specified in the connection string. If ``defaultauthdb`` is
       unspecified, then :urioption:`authSource` defaults to ``admin``.

       The ``PLAIN`` (LDAP), ``GSSAPI`` (Kerberos), and ``MONGODB-AWS``
       (IAM) authentication mechanisms require that
       :urioption:`authSource` be set to ``$external``, as these
       mechanisms delegate credential storage to external services.

       MongoDB will ignore :urioption:`authSource` values if no username
       is provided, either in the connection string or via the
       ``--username`` parameter.

   * - .. urioption:: authMechanism

     - Specify the authentication mechanism that MongoDB will use to
       authenticate the connection. Possible values include:

       - :ref:`SCRAM-SHA-1 <authentication-scram-sha-1>`

       - :ref:`SCRAM-SHA-256 <authentication-scram-sha-256>` (*Added in MongoDB 4.0*)

       - :ref:`MONGODB-X509 <security-auth-x509>`

       - ``MONGODB-AWS`` (*Added in MongoDB 4.4*)

       - :ref:`GSSAPI <security-auth-kerberos>` (Kerberos)

       - :ref:`PLAIN <security-auth-ldap>` (LDAP SASL)

       MongoDB 4.0 removes support for the ``MONGODB-CR``
       authentication mechanism. You cannot specify ``MONGODB-CR`` as
       the authentication mechanism when connecting to MongoDB 4.0+
       deployments.

       Only MongoDB Enterprise :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
       :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances provide ``GSSAPI`` (Kerberos) and
       ``PLAIN`` (LDAP) mechanisms.
       
       To use ``MONGODB-X509``, you must have TLS/SSL Enabled.

       To use ``MONGODB-AWS``, you must be connecting to a
       `MongoDB Atlas
       <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_server>`__ cluster
       which has been configured to support authentication via
       `AWS IAM credentials
       <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html>`__
       (i.e. an AWS access key ID and a secret access key, and
       optionally an `AWS session token
       <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html>`__).
       The ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism requires that the
       :urioption:`authSource` be set to ``$external``.

       When using ``MONGODB-AWS``, provide your AWS access key ID as the
       username and the secret access key as the password. If using an
       `AWS session token
       <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html>`__
       as well, provide it with the ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN``
       :urioption:`authMechanismProperties` value.

       .. note::

          If the AWS access key ID, secret access key, or session token
          include the following characters:

          .. code-block:: none

             : / ? # [ ] @

          those characters must be converted using `percent encoding
          <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1>`__.

       Alternatively, if the AWS access key ID, secret access key, or
       session token are defined on your platform using their respective
       `AWS IAM environment variables
       <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-list>`__
       :binary:`~bin.mongosh` will use these environment
       variable values to authenticate; you do not need to specify them
       in the connection string.

       See :ref:`Connect to an Atlas Cluster
       <connections-string-example-mongodb-aws>` for example usage of
       the ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism using both a
       connection string and the environment variables method.

       See :doc:`/core/authentication` for more information about the
       authentication system in MongoDB. Also consider
       :doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication` for more
       information on x509 authentication.

   * - .. urioption:: authMechanismProperties

     - Specify properties for the specified :urioption:`authMechanism`
       as a comma-separated list of colon-separated key-value pairs.

       Possible key-value pairs are:

       ``SERVICE_NAME:<string>``
         Set the Kerberos service name when connecting to Kerberized
         MongoDB instances. This value must match the service name set
         on MongoDB instances to which you are connecting. Only valid
         when using the :ref:`GSSAPI<security-auth-kerberos>`
         authentication mechanism.

         ``SERVICE_NAME`` defaults to ``mongodb`` for all clients and
         MongoDB instances. If you change the
         :parameter:`saslServiceName` setting on a MongoDB instance, you
         must set ``SERVICE_NAME`` to match that setting. Only valid
         when using the :ref:`GSSAPI<security-auth-kerberos>`
         authentication mechanism.

       ``CANONICALIZE_HOST_NAME:true|false``
         Canonicalize the hostname of the client host machine when
         connecting to the Kerberos server. This may be required when
         hosts report different hostnames than what is in the Kerberos
         database. Defaults to ``false``. Only valid when using the
         :ref:`GSSAPI<security-auth-kerberos>` authentication
         mechanism.

       ``SERVICE_REALM:<string>``
         Set the Kerberos realm for the MongoDB service. This may be
         necessary to support cross-realm authentication where the user
         exists in one realm and the service in another. Only valid when
         using the :ref:`GSSAPI<security-auth-kerberos>` authentication
         mechanism.

       ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN:<security_token>``
         Set the AWS session token for authentication with temporary
         credentials when using an `AssumeRole
         <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html>`__
         request, or when working with AWS resources that specify this
         value such as Lambda. Only valid when using the ``MONGODB-AWS``
         authentication mechanism. You must have an AWS access key ID
         and a secret access key as well. See
         :ref:`Connect to an Atlas Cluster
         <connections-string-example-mongodb-aws>` for example usage.

   * - .. urioption:: gssapiServiceName

     - Set the Kerberos service name when connecting to Kerberized
       MongoDB instances. This value must match the service name set on
       MongoDB instances to which you are connecting.

       :urioption:`gssapiServiceName` defaults to ``mongodb`` for all
       clients and MongoDB instances. If you change
       :parameter:`saslServiceName` setting on a MongoDB instance, you
       must set :urioption:`gssapiServiceName` to match that setting.

       :urioption:`gssapiServiceName` is a deprecated aliases for
       :urioption:`authMechanismProperties=SERVICE_NAME:mongodb
       <authMechanismProperties>`. For more information on which
       options your driver supports and their relative priority to each
       other, reference the documentation for your preferred driver
       version.

.. _selection-discovery-options:

Server Selection and Discovery Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides the following options to configure how MongoDB drivers
and :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances select a server to which to direct read
or write operations.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: localThresholdMS

     - The size (in milliseconds) of the latency window for selecting
       among multiple suitable MongoDB instances. *Default*: 15
       milliseconds.

       All drivers use :urioption:`localThresholdMS`. Use the
       ``localThreshold`` alias when specifying the latency window size
       to :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

   * - .. urioption:: serverSelectionTimeoutMS

     - Specifies how long (in milliseconds) to block for server
       selection before throwing an exception. *Default*: 30,000
       milliseconds.

   * - .. urioption:: serverSelectionTryOnce

     - **Single-threaded drivers only**. When ``true``, instructs the
       driver to scan the MongoDB deployment exactly once after server
       selection fails and then either select a server or raise an
       error. When ``false``, the driver blocks and searches for a
       server up to the :urioption:`serverSelectionTimeoutMS` value.
       *Default*: ``true``.

       Multi-threaded drivers and :binary:`~bin.mongos` do not support
       :urioption:`serverSelectionTryOnce`.

   * - .. urioption:: heartbeatFrequencyMS

     - :urioption:`heartbeatFrequencyMS` controls when the driver
       checks the state of the MongoDB deployment. Specify the interval
       (in milliseconds) between checks, counted from the end of the
       previous check until the beginning of the next one.

       *Default*:

       - Single-threaded drivers: 60 seconds.
       - Multi-threaded drivers: 10 seconds.

       :binary:`~bin.mongos` does not support changing the frequency of
       the heartbeat checks.

Miscellaneous Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: appName

     - Specify a custom app name. The app name appears in

       - :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` :doc:`logs
         </reference/log-messages>`,

       - the :data:`currentOp.appName` field in the :dbcommand:`currentOp`
         command and :method:`db.currentOp()` method output,

       - the :data:`system.profile.appName` field in the :doc:`database
         profiler </reference/database-profiler>` output.

       The :urioption:`appName` connection option is only applicable
       when provided to a :ecosystem:`MongoDB Driver </>`. This
       parameter has no effect when supplied to a client application
       such as :compass:`MongoDB Compass </>` or :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.

       .. versionadded:: 4.0

   * - .. urioption:: retryReads

     - Enables :ref:`retryable reads <retryable-reads>`.

       Possible values are:

       - ``true``. Enables retryable reads for the connection. 

         Official MongoDB drivers compatible with 
         MongoDB Server 4.2 and later default to ``true``.

       - ``false``. Disables retryable reads for the connection.
       
       :binary:`~bin.mongosh` does not support retryable reads.

       .. versionadded:: 4.2

   * - .. urioption:: retryWrites

     - Enable :ref:`retryable writes <retryable-writes>`.

       Possible values are:

       - ``true``. Enables retryable writes for the connection. 

         Official MongoDB 4.2+ compatible drivers default to ``true``.

       - ``false``. Disables retryable writes for the connection. 
       
         Official MongoDB 4.0 and 3.6-compatible drivers default to ``false``.

       MongoDB drivers retry 
       :ref:`transaction commit and abort operations <transactions-retry>`
       regardless of the value of :urioption:`retryWrites`. For more 
       information on transaction retryability, see
       :ref:`transactions-retry`. 

   * - .. urioption:: uuidRepresentation

     - Possible values are:

       ``standard``
         The standard binary representation.

       ``csharpLegacy``
         The default representation for the C# driver.

       ``javaLegacy``
         The default representation for the Java driver.

       ``pythonLegacy``
         The default representation for the Python driver.

       For the default, see the :driver:`Drivers </>`
       documentation for your driver.

       .. note::
          Not all drivers support the :urioption:`uuidRepresentation`
          option. For information on your driver, see the :driver:`drivers
          </>` documentation.

Connecting to Atlas using AWS IAM credentials in this manner uses the
``MONGODB-AWS`` :urioption:`authentication mechanism <authMechanism>`
and the ``$external`` :urioption:`authSource`, as shown in this example.

If using an `AWS session token
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html>`__,
as well, provide it with the ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN``
:urioption:`authMechanismProperties` value, as follows:

.. code-block:: none

   mongosh 'mongodb+srv://<aws access key id>:<aws secret access key>@cluster0.example.com/testdb?authSource=$external&authMechanism=MONGODB-AWS&authMechanismProperties=AWS_SESSION_TOKEN:<aws session token>'

.. note::

   If the AWS access key ID, the secret access key, or the session token
   include the following characters:

   .. code-block:: none

      : / ? # [ ] @

   those characters must be converted using `percent encoding
   <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1>`__. 

You may also set these credentials on your platform using standard
`AWS IAM environment variables
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-list>`__.
:binary:`~bin.mongosh` checks for the following environment
variables when you use the ``MONGODB-AWS``
:urioption:`authentication mechanism <authMechanism>`:

- ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID``
- ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``
- ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN``

If set, these credentials do not need to be specified in the connection
string.

The following example sets these environment variables in the ``bash``
shell:

.. code-block:: none

   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='<aws access key id>'
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='<aws secret access key>'
   export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN='<aws session token>'

Syntax for setting environment variables in other shells will be
different. Consult the documentation for your platform for more
information.

You can verify that these environment variables have been set with the
following command:

.. code-block:: none

   env | grep AWS

Once set, the following example connects to a MongoDB Atlas cluster
using these environment variables:

.. code-block:: none

   mongosh 'mongodb+srv://cluster0.example.com/testdb?authSource=$external&authMechanism=MONGODB-AWS'
