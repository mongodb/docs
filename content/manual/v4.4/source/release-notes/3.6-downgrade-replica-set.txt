Before you attempt any downgrade, familiarize yourself with the content

Downgrade Path
--------------

.. include:: /includes/3.6-downgrade-path.rst

Create Backup
-------------

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before downgrading the binaries, you must downgrade the feature
compatibility version and remove any |newversion| features
:ref:`incompatible <3.6-compatibility-enabled>` with |oldversion| or earlier
versions as generally outlined below. These steps are necessary only if
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` has ever been set to ``"3.6"``.

.. |target| replace:: primary

.. _3.6-downgrade-feature-compatibility-rs:

1. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tip::

   - Ensure that no initial sync is in progress. Running
     :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command while an
     initial sync is in progress will cause the initial sync to restart.

   - Ensure that no replica set member is in :replstate:`ROLLBACK` or
     :replstate:`RECOVERING` state.

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the |target|.

#. .. include:: /includes/3.6-downgrade-fcv.rst

To ensure that all members of the replica set reflect the updated
``featureCompatibilityVersion``, connect to each replica set member and
check the ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

All members should return a result that includes:

.. code-block:: javascript

   "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.4" }

If any member returns a ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` that includes
either a ``version`` value of ``"3.6"`` or a ``targetVersion`` field,
wait for the member to reflect version ``"3.4"`` before proceeding.

For more information on the returned ``featureCompatibilityVersion``
value, see :ref:`view-fcv`.

2. Remove Backwards Incompatible Persisted Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/remove-3.6-fcv-features.rst

Procedure
---------

.. warning::

   Before proceeding with the downgrade procedure, ensure that all
   replica set members, including delayed replica set members, reflect
   the prerequisite changes. That is, check the
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` and the removal of incompatible
   features for each node before downgrading.
