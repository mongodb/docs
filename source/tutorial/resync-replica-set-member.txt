Resync a Member of a Replica Set
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

When a secondary's replication process falls so far behind that
:term:`primary` overwrites oplog entries that the secondary has not yet
replicated, that secondary cannot catch up and becomes "stale." When
that occurs, you must completely resynchronize the member by removing
its data and performing an initial sync.

To do so, use one of the following approaches:

- Restart the :program:`mongod` with an empty data directory and let
  MongoDB's normal initial syncing feature restore the data. This
  is the more simple option, but may take longer to replace the data.

  See :ref:`replica-set-auto-resync-stale-member`.

- Restart the machine with a copy of a recent data directory from
  another member in the :term:`replica set`. This procedure can replace
  the data more quickly but requires more manual steps.

  See :ref:`replica-set-resync-by-copying`.

.. index:: replica set; resync
.. _replica-set-auto-resync-stale-member:

Automatically Resync a Stale Member
-----------------------------------

This procedure relies on MongoDB's regular process for initial
sync. This will restore the data on the stale member to reflect the
current state of the set. For an overview of MongoDB initial sync
process, see the :ref:`replica-set-syncing` section.

To resync the stale member:

1. Stop the stale member's :program:`mongod` instance. On Linux
   systems you can use :option:`mongod --shutdown` Set
   :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` to the member's data
   directory, as in the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --dbpath /data/db/ --shutdown

#. Delete all data and sub-directories from the member's data
   directory.  By removing the data :setting:`dbpath`, MongoDB will
   perform a complete resync. Consider making a backup first.

#. Restart the :program:`mongod` instance on the member.  For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --dbpath /data/db/ --replSet rsProduction

   At this point, the :program:`mongod` will perform an initial
   sync. The length of the initial sync may process depends on the
   size of the database and network connection between members of the
   replica set.

   Initial sync operations can impact the other members of the set and
   create additional traffic to the primary, and can only occur if
   another member of the set is accessible and up to date.

.. index:: replica set; resync
.. _replica-set-resync-by-copying:

Resync by Copying All Datafiles from Another Member
---------------------------------------------------

This approach uses a copy of the data files from an existing member of
the replica set, or a back of the data files to "seed" the stale member.

The copy or backup of the data files **must** be sufficiently recent
to allow the new member to catch up with the :term:`oplog`, otherwise
the member would need to perform an initial sync.

.. note::

   In most cases you cannot copy data files from a running
   :program:`mongod` instance to another, because the data files will
   change during the file copy operation. Consider the
   :doc:`/core/backups` documentation for several methods
   that you can use to capture a consistent snapshot of a running
   :program:`mongod` instance.

.. important:: You must always copy the content of the ``local``
   database when using data files to resync a member of a replica
   set.

After you have copied the data files from the "seed" source, start the
:program:`mongod` instance and allow it to apply all operations from
the oplog until it reflects the current state of the replica set.
