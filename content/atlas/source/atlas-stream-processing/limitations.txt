The following limitations apply to {+atlas-sp+}:

- The ``state.stateSize`` of a stream processor can't exceed 80% of
  the RAM available for its pod. For example, the maximum size of a
  stream processor in the ``SP30`` tier, which has 8GB of RAM, is
  6.4GB. If the ``state.stateSize`` of any of your stream processors
  is approaching 80% of its available RAM, consider stopping the
  processor and restarting it on a higher tier. If your stream
  processor already runs at the maximum tier enabled for your
  {+spw+}, consider adjusting your {+spw+} configuration to enable
  higher-tier stream processors.

  When a stream processor crosses the 80% RAM threshold, it fails 
  with a ``stream processing workspace out of memory`` error. You can 
  view the ``state.stateSize`` value of each stream processor with the 
  ``sp.processor.stats()`` command. See :ref:`View Statistics of a Stream 
  Processor <atlas-sp-manage-processor-stats>` to learn more.

- A {+spw+} can use only {+clusters+} in the same project as sources or
  sinks.

- An {+atlas-sp+} pipeline definition cannot exceed 16 MB.

- Only users with the :authrole:`Project Owner` or 
  :atlasrole:`Atlas admin` roles can use {+atlas-sp+}.

- {+atlas-sp+} currently supports only the following connection types:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 30 70
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Connection Type
       - Usage

     * - {+kafka+}
       - Source or Sink

     * - {+service+} Database
       - Source or Sink

     * - Sample Connection
       - Source Only

- For {+atlas-sp+} using {+kafka+} as a :ref:`$source
  <atlas-sp-agg-source>`, if the {+kafka+} topic acting as :ref:`$source 
  <atlas-sp-agg-source>` to the running processor adds a partition,
  {+atlas-sp+} continues running without reading the partition.
  The processor fails when it detects the new partition after you restore
  it from a checkpoint after a failure, or you restart it after stopping it. 
  You must recreate the processors that read from topics with
  the newly added partitions. 

- For {+kafka+} connections, {+atlas-sp+} currently supports only the
  following security protocols:

  - ``SASL_PLAINTEXT``
  - ``SASL_SSL``
  - ``SSL``
  
  For ``SASL``, {+atlas-sp+} supports the following mechanisms:

  - ``PLAIN``
  - ``SCRAM-SHA-256``
  - ``SCRAM-SHA-512``
  - ``OAUTHBEARER``

  For ``SSL``, you must provide the following assets
  for your {+kafka+} system mutual TLS authentication with {+atlas-sp+}:

  - a Certificate Authority (if you are using one other than the default {+kafka+} CA)
  - a client TLS certificate
  - a TLS keyfile, used to sign your TLS certificate

- {+atlas-sp+} currently supports
  :manual:`$function </reference/operator/aggregation/function/>`
  JavaScript :abbr:`UDFs (user-defined functions)` only on AWS.

- {+atlas-sp+} supports a subset of the Aggregation Pipeline Stages available 
  in |service|, allowing you to perform many of the same operations on streaming 
  data that you can perform on data-at-rest. For a full list of supported 
  Aggregation Pipeline Stages, see the :ref:`Stream Aggregation documentation <atlas-sp-aggregation>`.
 
- {+atlas-sp+} doesn't support the aggregation variables ``$$NOW``, 
  ``$$CLUSTER_TIME``, ``$$USER_ROLES``, and ``$SEARCH_META``.
