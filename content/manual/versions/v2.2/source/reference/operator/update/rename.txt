.. update:: $rename

   .. versionadded:: 1.7.2

   *Syntax*: ``{$rename: { <old name1>: <new name1>, <old name2>: <new name2>, ... } }``

   The :update:`$rename` operator updates the name of a field. The
   new field name must differ from the existing field name.

   Consider the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.students.update( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { 'nickname': 'alias', 'cell': 'mobile' } } )

   This operation renames the field ``nickname`` to ``alias``, and the
   field ``cell`` to ``mobile``.

   If the document already has a field with the *new* field name, the
   :update:`$rename` operator removes that field and renames the
   field with the *old* field name to the *new* field name.

   The :update:`$rename` operator will expand arrays and
   sub-documents to find a match for field names. When renaming a field
   in a sub-document to another sub-document or to a regular field, the
   sub-document itself remains.

   Consider the following examples involving the sub-document of the
   following document:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "_id": 1,
        "alias": [ "The American Cincinnatus", "The American Fabius" ],
        "mobile": "555-555-5555",
        "nmae": { "first" : "george", "last" : "washington" }
      }

   - To rename a sub-document, call the :update:`$rename` operator
     with the name of the sub-document as you would any other field:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.students.update( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { "nmae": "name" } } )

     This operation renames the sub-document ``nmae`` to ``name``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { "_id": 1,
          "alias": [ "The American Cincinnatus", "The American Fabius" ],
          "mobile": "555-555-5555",
          "name": { "first" : "george", "last" : "washington" }
        }

   - To rename a field within a sub-document, call the
     :update:`$rename` operator using the
     :ref:`dot notation <document-dot-notation>`
     to refer to the field.
     Include the name of the sub-document in the new field name to
     ensure the field remains in the sub-document:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.students.update( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { "name.first": "name.fname" } } )

     This operation renames the sub-document field ``first`` to ``fname``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { "_id" : 1,
          "alias" : [ "The American Cincinnatus", "The American Fabius" ],
          "mobile" : "555-555-5555",
          "name" : { "fname" : "george", "last" : "washington" }
        }

   - To rename a field within a sub-document and move it to another
     sub-document, call the :update:`$rename` operator using the
     :ref:`dot notation <document-dot-notation>`
     to refer to the field. Include the name of the new sub-document in
     the ``new name``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.students.update( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { "name.last": "contact.lname" } } )

     This operation renames the sub-document field ``last`` to ``lname`` and
     moves it to the sub-document ``contact``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { "_id" : 1,
          "alias" : [ "The American Cincinnatus", "The American Fabius" ],
          "contact" : { "lname" : "washington" },
          "mobile" : "555-555-5555",
          "name" : { "fname" : "george" }
        }

     If the new field name does not include a sub-document name, the
     field moves out of the subdocument and becomes a regular document
     field.

   Consider the following behavior when the specified old field name
   does not exist:

   - When renaming a single field and the existing field name refers to a
     non-existing field, the :update:`$rename` operator does
     nothing, as in the following:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.students.update( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { 'wife': 'spouse' } } )

     This operation does nothing because there is no field named
     ``wife``.

   - When renaming multiple fields and **all** of the old field names
     refer to non-existing fields, the :update:`$rename` operator
     does nothing, as in the following:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.students.update( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { 'wife': 'spouse',
                                                     'vice': 'vp',
                                                     'office': 'term' } } )

     This operation does nothing because there are no fields named
     ``wife``, ``vice``, and ``office``.

   - When renaming multiple fields and **some** but not all old field
     names refer to non-existing fields, the :update:`$rename`
     operator performs the following operations:

     .. versionchanged:: 2.2

     - Renames the fields that exist to the specified new field names.

     - Ignores the non-existing fields.

     Consider the following query that renames both an existing field
     ``mobile`` and a non-existing field ``wife``. The field named
     ``wife`` does not exist and :update:`$rename` sets the field to
     a name that already exists ``alias``.

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.students.update( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { 'wife': 'alias',
                                                     'mobile': 'cell' } } )

     This operation renames the ``mobile`` field to ``cell``, and has
     no other impact
     action occurs.

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { "_id" : 1,
          "alias" : [ "The American Cincinnatus", "The American Fabius" ],
          "cell" : "555-555-5555",
          "name" : { "lname" : "washington" },
          "places" : { "d" : "Mt Vernon", "b" : "Colonial Beach" }
        }


     .. note::

        Before version 2.2, when renaming multiple fields and only some (but
        not all) old field names refer to non-existing fields:

        - For the fields with the old names that do exist, the
          :update:`$rename` operator renames these fields to the
          specified new field names.

        - For the fields with the old names that do **not** exist:

          - **if** no field exists with the new field name, the
            :update:`$rename` operator does nothing.

          - **if** fields already exist with the new field names, the
            :update:`$rename` operator drops these fields.

        Consider the following operation that renames both the field
        ``mobile``, which exists, and the field ``wife``, which does
        not exist. The operation tries to set the field named ``wife``
        to ``alias``, which is the name of an existing field:

        .. code-block:: javascript

           db.students.update( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { 'wife': 'alias', 'mobile': 'cell' } } )

        Before 2.2, the operation renames the field ``mobile`` to
        ``cell`` *and* drops the ``alias`` field even though the field
        ``wife`` does not exist:

        .. code-block:: javascript

           { "_id" : 1,
             "cell" : "555-555-5555",
             "name" : { "lname" : "washington" },
             "places" : { "d" : "Mt Vernon", "b" : "Colonial Beach" }
           }
