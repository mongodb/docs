The database profiler captures data information about read and write
operations, cursor operations, and database commands. To configure the
database profile and set the thresholds for capturing profile data,
see the :doc:`/tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler` section.

The database profiler writes data in the :data:`system.profile
<<database>.system.profile>` collection,
which is a :term:`capped collection`. To view the profiler's output,
use normal MongoDB queries on the :data:`system.profile
<<database>.system.profile>` collection.

.. note::

   Because the database profiler writes data to the
   :data:`system.profile <<database>.system.profile>` collection in a
   database, the profiler will profile some write activity, even for
   databases that are otherwise read-only.

Example ``system.profile`` Document
-----------------------------------

The documents in the :data:`system.profile
<<database>.system.profile>` collection have the following form. This
example document reflects an update operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "op" : "update",
       "ns" : "social.users",
       "query" : {
           "name" : "j.r."
       },
       "updateobj" : {
           "$set" : {
               "likes" : [
                   "basketball",
                   "trekking"
               ]
           }
       },
       "nscanned" : 1,
       "nscannedObjects" : 1,
       "moved" : true,
       "nmoved" : 1,
       "nMatched" : 1,
       "nModified" : 1,
       "keyUpdates" : 0,
       "numYield" : 0,
       "lockStats" : {
           "timeLockedMicros" : {
               "r" : NumberLong(0),
               "w" : NumberLong(258)
           },
           "timeAcquiringMicros" : {
               "r" : NumberLong(0),
               "w" : NumberLong(7)
           }
       },
       "millis" : 0,
       "execStats" : {
       },
       "ts" : ISODate("2012-12-10T19:31:28.977Z"),
       "client" : "127.0.0.1",
       "allUsers" : [ ],
       "user" : ""
   }

Output Reference
----------------

For any single operation, the documents created by the database
profiler will include a subset of the following fields. The precise
selection of fields in these documents depends on the type of
operation.

.. data:: system.profile.op

   The type of operation. The possible values are:

   - ``insert``
   - ``query``
   - ``update``
   - ``remove``
   - ``getmore``
   - ``command``

.. data:: system.profile.ns

   The :term:`namespace` the operation targets. Namespaces in MongoDB
   take the form of the :term:`database`, followed by a dot (``.``),
   followed by the name of
   the :term:`collection`.

.. data:: system.profile.query

   The :ref:`query document <read-operations-query-document>` used.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/profiler-getmore-operation-query-field.rst

.. data:: system.profile.command

   The command operation.

.. data:: system.profile.updateobj

   The ``<update>`` document passed in
   during an :doc:`update </tutorial/modify-documents>` operation.

.. data:: system.profile.cursorid

   The ID of the cursor accessed by a ``getmore`` operation.

.. data:: system.profile.ntoreturn

   .. versionchanged:: 2.2
      In 2.0, MongoDB includes this field for ``query`` and
      ``command`` operations. In 2.2, this information MongoDB also
      includes this field for ``getmore`` operations.

   The number of documents the operation specified to return. For
   example, the :dbcommand:`profile` command would return one document
   (a results document) so the :data:`~system.profile.ntoreturn` value would be ``1``. The
   :method:`limit(5) <cursor.limit()>` command would return five
   documents so the :data:`~system.profile.ntoreturn` value would be ``5``.

   If the :data:`~system.profile.ntoreturn` value is ``0``, the command did not specify a
   number of documents to return, as would be the case with a simple
   :method:`~db.collection.find()` command with no limit
   specified.

.. data:: system.profile.ntoskip

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   The number of documents the :method:`~cursor.skip()` method
   specified to skip.

.. data:: system.profile.nscanned

   The number of documents that MongoDB scans in the :doc:`index </indexes>` in order to
   carry out the operation.

   In general, if :data:`~system.profile.nscanned` is much higher than :data:`~system.profile.nreturned`, the
   database is scanning many objects to find the target objects.
   Consider creating an index to improve this.

.. data:: system.profile.nscannedObjects

   The number of documents that MongoDB scans from the collection in
   order to carry out the operation.

.. data:: system.profile.moved

   This field appears with a value of ``true`` when an update operation
   moved one or more documents to a new location on disk. If the operation
   did not result in a move, this field does not appear. Operations that
   result in a move take more time than in-place updates and typically
   occur as a result of document growth.

.. data:: system.profile.nmoved

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   The number of documents the operation moved on disk. This field appears
   only if the operation resulted in a move. The field's implicit value is
   zero, and the field is present only when non-zero.

.. data:: system.profile.scanAndOrder

   :data:`~system.profile.scanAndOrder` is a boolean that is ``true`` when
   a query **cannot** use the order of documents in the index for
   returning sorted results: MongoDB must sort the documents after it
   receives the documents from a cursor.

   If :data:`~system.profile.scanAndOrder` is ``false``, MongoDB *can* use
   the order of the documents in an index to return sorted results.

   .. Based on informal tests, it looks like:data:`~system.profile.scanAndOrder`  is
      only included in the profiler data when scanAndOrder is true.

.. data:: system.profile.ndeleted

   The number of documents deleted by the operation.

.. data:: system.profile.ninserted

   The number of documents inserted by the operation.

.. data:: system.profile.nMatched

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   The number of documents that match the :data:`system.profile.query`
   condition for the update operation.

.. data:: system.profile.nModified

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   The number of documents modified by the update operation.

.. data:: system.profile.upsert

   A boolean that indicates the update operation's ``upsert`` option
   value. Only appears if ``upsert`` is true.

.. data:: system.profile.keyUpdates

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   The number of :doc:`index </indexes>` keys the update changed in
   the operation. Changing an index key
   carries a small performance cost because the database must remove the old
   key and inserts a new key into the B-tree index.

.. data:: system.profile.numYield

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   The number of times the operation yielded to allow other operations
   to complete. Typically, operations yield when they need access to
   data that MongoDB has not yet fully read into memory. This allows
   other operations that have data in memory to complete while MongoDB
   reads in data for the yielding operation. For more information,
   see :ref:`the FAQ on when operations yield <faq-concurrency-yielding>`.

.. data:: system.profile.lockStats

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   The time in microseconds the operation spent acquiring and holding
   locks. This field reports data for the following lock types:

   - ``R`` - global read lock
   - ``W`` - global write lock
   - ``r`` - database-specific read lock
   - ``w`` - database-specific write lock

   .. data:: system.profile.lockStats.timeLockedMicros

      The time in microseconds the operation held a specific lock. For
      operations that require more than one lock, like those
      that lock the ``local`` database to update the :term:`oplog`,
      this value may be longer than the total length of the
      operation (i.e. :data:`~system.profile.millis`.)

   .. data:: system.profile.lockStats.timeAcquiringMicros

      The time in microseconds the operation spent waiting to acquire a
      specific lock.

.. data:: system.profile.nreturned

   The number of documents returned by the operation.

.. data:: system.profile.responseLength

   The length in bytes of the operation's result document. A large
   :data:`~system.profile.responseLength` can affect performance.
   To limit the size of the
   result document for a query operation, you can use any of the
   following:

   - :ref:`Projections <read-operations-projection>`
   - :method:`The limit() method <cursor.limit()>`
   - :method:`The batchSize() method <cursor.batchSize()>`

   .. note:: When MongoDB writes query profile information to the log,
      the :data:`~system.profile.responseLength` value is in a field
      named ``reslen``.

.. data:: system.profile.millis

   The time in milliseconds from the perspective of the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` from the beginning of the operation to the end of
   the operation.

.. data:: system.profile.execStats

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   A document that contains the execution statistics of the query
   operation. For other operations, the value is an empty document.

   The :data:`system.profile.execStats` presents the staticstics as a
   tree; each node provides the statistics for the operation executed
   during that stage of the query operation.

   .. note::

      The following fields list for :data:`~system.profile.execStats`
      is not meant to be exhaustive as the returned fields vary per
      stage.

   .. data:: system.profile.execStats.type

      The descriptive name for the operation performed as part of the
      query execution; e.g.

      - ``COLLSCAN`` for a collection scan
      - ``IXSCAN`` for scanning index keys
      - ``FETCH`` for retrieving documents

   .. data:: system.profile.execStats.children

      An array that contains statistics for the operations that are the
      children of the current stage.

.. data:: system.profile.ts

   The timestamp of the operation.

.. data:: system.profile.client

   The IP address or hostname of the client connection where the
   operation originates.

   For some operations, such as :method:`db.eval()`, the client is
   ``0.0.0.0:0`` instead of an actual client.

.. data:: system.profile.allUsers

   An array of authenticated user information (user name and database)
   for the session. See also :ref:`client-authentication`.

.. data:: system.profile.user

   The authenticated user who ran the operation. If the operation was
   not run by an authenticated user, this field's value is an empty
   string.
