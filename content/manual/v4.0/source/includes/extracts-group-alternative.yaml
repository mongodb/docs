   .. note::
      Because {{group}} uses JavaScript, it is
      subject to a number of performance limitations. For most cases the
      :pipeline:`$group` operator in the :doc:`aggregation pipeline
      </core/aggregation-pipeline>` provides a suitable alternative with
      fewer restrictions.
