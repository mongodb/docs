To delete your |service| account, you must ensure that you have no:

- Outstanding invoices
- Active clusters
- Projects  
- Organizations


This document walks you through deleting your 
|service| account.



Delete All Projects
-------------------

.. admonition:: Prerequisites
   :class: important

   To delete a project for an organization:

   - You must either have the ``Owner`` role for the project or have the ``Organization 
     Owner`` role for the project's organization.

   - The project must have no outstanding invoices.

   - The project must have no active clusters.


Check Project Invoices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To learn how to view your project's invoices, see
:ref:`atlas-invoices`.


Terminate All Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Terminating a cluster also deletes any backup snapshots for that
   cluster. See :ref:`retention-policy`.

To terminate an |service| cluster:

.. include:: /includes/steps/terminate-atlas-cluster.rst

|service| executes the terminate operation after completing any
in-progress deployment changes.


Delete a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete a project for an organization either from the
organization's :guilabel:`Projects` view or the project's
:guilabel:`Project Setting` view:

.. tabs::

   tabs:

   - id: projects-view

     name: "Delete from Projects view"

     content: |
       .. include:: /includes/steps/delete-project.rst

   - id: project-setting-view

     name: "Delete from Project Setting view"

     content: |
       .. include:: /includes/steps/delete-project-from-settings.rst


Delete All Organizations
------------------------

.. important::

   To delete an organization, you must have :authrole:`Organization
   Owner` role for the organization.

   You cannot delete an organization that has active projects. You must
   delete the organization's projects before you can delete the
   organization.

.. include:: /includes/steps/delete-organization.rst

Email Atlas Support to Finalize Deletion Process
------------------------------------------------

.. important::

   Once you delete all active clusters, projects, and organizations, you
   will no longer be billed for any |service| activity and will no
   longer receive |service| alerts.

To finalize the deletion process, send an email with the subject line
:guilabel:`Request for Atlas Account Deletion` to the |service| support
team at: `cloud-account-support@mongodb.com <mailto:cloud-account-support@mongodb.com?subject=Request%20for%20Atlas%20Account%20Deletion&body=Hello%2C%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20would%20like%20to%20delete%20my%20account.%20My%20username%20is%3A%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20understand%20my%20cloud%20projects%20and%20cloud%20organizations%20associated%20with%20my%20account%20must%20be%20deleted.%0D%0AI%20understand%20I%20cannot%20reuse%20the%20email%20address%20that%20is%20associated%20with%20the%20deleted%20account%20to%20create%20a%20new%20Atlas%20account.%0D%0A%0D%0AThank%20you%2C>`__.

For security purposes, you must send the email from the same email
address associated with the |service| account you want to delete.

.. important::
   
   You cannot reuse the email address that is associated with the 
   deleted account to create a new |service| account.
