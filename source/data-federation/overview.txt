About {+adf+}
---------------------------

{+adf+} is a distributed query engine that allows you to natively 
query, transform, and move data across various sources inside & outside 
of |service-fullname|. 

Sample Uses 
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use {+adf+} to: 

- Copy |service| cluster data into Parquet or |csv| files written to 
  |aws| |s3| buckets. 
- Query across multiple |service| clusters to get a holistic view of 
  your data.
- Materialize aggregations across |service| clusters and |aws| |s3| 
  data.
- Read and import data from your |aws| |s3| buckets into an |service| 
  cluster.

Key Concepts 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. expression:: Federated Database Instance 

   A {+fdi+} is a deployment of {+adf+}. Each {+fdi+} contains virtual 
   databases and collections that map to data in your data stores.

.. expression:: Data Store 

   Data store refers to the location of your data. {+adf+} supports the 
   following data stores: 

   - |service| cluster 
   - {+adl+} datasets
   - |aws| |s3| buckets 
   - |http| endpoints

.. expression:: Storage Configuration 

   Storage configuration contains mappings between your virtual 
   databases and collections and data sources in |json| format. You can 
   define these mappings in the storage configuration to access and run 
   queries against your data.

{+adf+} Regions 
-----------------------------

.. note::

   To prevent excessive charges on your bill, create your {+adf+} in 
   the same |aws| region as your |s3| data source.

{+adf+} routes your federated database requests through one of the 
following regions:

.. include:: /includes/list-table-adf-supported-aws-regions.rst

.. note::

   You will incur charges when running federated queries. For more 
   information, see :ref:`atlas-data-federation-billing`.
