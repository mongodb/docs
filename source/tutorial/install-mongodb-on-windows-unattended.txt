Prerequisites
-------------

Platform Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB requires x86 64-architecture and supports the following:

- Windows 7/Server 2008 R2

- Windows 8/2012 R2 and later

See :ref:`mongodb-supported-platforms` for more information.

Windows Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows 2012 Server and Windows 10 need `KB2999226
<https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2999226/update-for-universal
-c-runtime-in-windows>`__ to provide Universal C Runtime support for
Windows.

Production Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before deploying MongoDB in a production environment, consider the
:doc:`/administration/production-notes` document.

Install |mdb-edition|
---------------------

.. note::

   You can also spin up MongoDB on Azure using Atlas, our fully-managed
   database-as-a-service. Atlas enables you to configure anything from a free
   sandbox environment to a globally sharded production cluster. `Set up a free
   cluster now
   <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?utm_source=install-mongodb-on-windows&utm_campaign=20-docs-in-20-days&utm_medium=docs>`_.

You can install MongoDB |mdb-edition| unattended on Windows from the
`Windows command prompt/interpreter
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-
commands/cmd>`__ (``cmd.exe``) using ``msiexec.exe``.

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-mongodb-on-windows-unattended.rst

Start |mdb-edition| from the Command Interpreter
------------------------------------------------

Open a `Windows command prompt/interpreter
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-
commands/cmd>`__ (``cmd.exe``) as an :guilabel:`Administrator`.
 
.. important::

   You must open the command interpreter as an
   :guilabel:`Administrator`.

Run |mdb-edition| as a Windows Service
----------------------------------------

.. _manually-create-windows-service:

Start |mdb-edition| as a Windows Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 4.0, you can install and configure MongoDB as a
:guilabel:`Windows Service` during the install, and the MongoDB service
is started upon successful installation. 

You can also manually manage the service from the command line. To
start the MongoDB service from the command line, open a `Windows
command prompt/interpreter
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-
commands/cmd>`__ (``cmd.exe``) as an :guilabel:`Administrator`, and
run the following command:

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-manually-windows-service-for-mongodb.rst

Stop |mdb-edition| as a Windows Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To stop/pause the MongoDB service, you can use the Services console:

#. From the Services console, locate the MongoDB service.


#. Right-click on the MongoDB service and click :guilabel:`Stop` (or :guilabel:`Pause`).

You can also manage the service from the command line. To stop the
MongoDB service from the command line, open a `Windows command
prompt/interpreter
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-
commands/cmd>`__ (``cmd.exe``) as an :guilabel:`Administrator`, and
run the following command:
  
.. code-block:: bat

   net stop MongoDB

Remove |mdb-edition| as a Windows Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remove the MongoDB service, first use the Services console to stop
the service. Then open a `Windows command prompt/interpreter
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-
commands/cmd>`__ (``cmd.exe``) as an :guilabel:`Administrator`, and
run the following command:

.. code-block:: bat

   sc.exe delete MongoDB

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

Security
~~~~~~~~

Starting with MongoDB 3.6, MongoDB binaries, :binary:`mongod.exe
<bin.mongod.exe>` and :binary:`mongos.exe <bin.mongos.exe>`, bind to
``localhost`` by default.

When bound only to the localhost, these binaries can only accept
connections from clients that are running on the same machine. Remote
clients cannot connect to the binaries bound only to localhost. For
more information, including how to override and bind to other ip
addresses, see :ref:`3.6-bind_ip-compatibility`.

Point Releases and ``.msi``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you installed MongoDB with the Windows installer (``.msi``), the
``.msi`` automatically upgrades within the :ref:`same release series
<release-version-numbers>` (e.g. 4.0.1 to 4.0.2).

Upgrading a full release series (e.g. 4.0 to 4.2) requires a new
installation.

Add MongoDB binaries to the System PATH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All command-line examples in this tutorial are provided as absolute
paths to the MongoDB binaries. You can add ``C:\Program
Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\bin`` to your System ``PATH`` and then
omit the full path to the MongoDB binaries.
