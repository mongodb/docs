name: maxConns
args: <number>
directive: option
description: |
  Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous connections that
  :program:`mongos` will accept. This setting will have no effect if the
  value of this setting is higher than your operating system's configured
  maximum connection tracking threshold.

  This setting is particularly useful for :program:`mongos` if you have a
  client that creates a number of collections but allows them to timeout
  rather than close the collections. When you set :setting:`~net.maxIncomingConnections`,
  ensure the value is slightly higher than the size of the connection pool
  or the total number of connections to prevent erroneous connection
  spikes from propagating to the members of a :term:`sharded cluster`.

  .. versionchanged:: 2.6
     MongoDB removed the upward limit on the :setting:`~net.maxIncomingConnections` setting.

name: configdb

directive: option
description: |
  Specifies the :term:`configuration database <config database>` for the
  :term:`sharded cluster`. You must specify either 1 or 3 configuration
  servers, in a comma separated list.

  All :program:`mongos` instances **must** specify the hosts in the
  {{role}} option in the in the same order.

  If your configuration databases reside in more that one data center,
  order the hosts so that the config database that is closest to the
  majority of your :program:`mongos` instances is first servers in the
  list.

  .. warning::

     Never remove a config server from this setting, even if the config
     server is not available or offline.

program: mongos
name: chunkSize
args: <value>
default: 64
directive: option
description: |
  Determines the size in megabytes of each :term:`chunk` in the
  :term:`sharded cluster`. A size of 64 megabytes is ideal in most
  deployments: larger chunk size can lead to uneven data distribution;
  smaller chunk size can lead to inefficient movement of chunks between
  nodes.

  This option affects chunk size *only* when you initialize the cluster
  for the first time. If you later modify the option, the new value has no
  effect. See the :doc:`/tutorial/modify-chunk-size-in-sharded-cluster`
  procedure if you need to change the chunk size on an existing sharded
  cluster.
optional: true

program: mongos
name: localThreshold
args: null
default: 15
directive: option
description: |
  Affects the logic that :program:`mongos` uses when selecting
  :term:`replica set` members to pass read operations to from clients.
  Specify a value in milliseconds. The default value of ``15``
  corresponds to the default value in all of the client :doc:`drivers
  </applications/drivers>`.

  When :program:`mongos` receives a request that permits reads to
  :term:`secondary` members, the :program:`mongos` will:

  - Find the member of the set with the lowest ping time.

  - Construct a list of replica set members that is within a ping time of
    15 milliseconds of the nearest suitable member of the set.

    If you specify a value for the {{role}} option, :program:`mongos` will
    construct the list of replica members that are within the latency
    allowed by this value.

  - Select a member to read from at random from this list.

  The ping time used for a member compared by the {{role}} setting is a
  moving average of recent ping times, calculated at most every 10
  seconds. As a result, some queries may reach members above the threshold
  until the :program:`mongos` recalculates the average.

  See the :ref:`replica-set-read-preference-behavior-member-selection`
  section of the :doc:`read preference </core/read-preference>`
  documentation for more information.

program: mongos
name: noAutoSplit
args: null
directive: option
description: |
  Prevents :program:`mongos` from automatically inserting metadata splits
  in a :term:`sharded collection <sharding>`. If set on all
  :program:`mongos` instances, this prevents MongoDB from creating new
  chunks as the data in a collection grows.

  Because any :program:`mongos` in a cluster can create a split, to
  totally disable splitting in a cluster you must set {{role}} on all
  :program:`mongos`.

  .. warning::

     With {{role}} enabled, the data in your sharded
     cluster may become imbalanced over time. Enable with caution.
