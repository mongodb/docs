Save and Reuse Queries 
======================

.. meta::
   :description: Save and reuse queries across multiple charts using the Query Library, allowing modifications to impact all connected charts.

The  :guilabel:`Query Library` allows you to reuse a query across 
multiple charts. If you save a query to the library, any user on your 
charts project can apply the same query on their own charts. Any 
changes to a query stored in the library impact all charts thar are 
connected to that query.

.. _charts-query-library-save:

Save Aggregation Pipeline Queries 
---------------------------------

After you apply an aggregation pipeline query to a chart, you can save 
it to the :guilabel:`Query Library`. This makes the query available 
for use on other charts created by you and other users on the same 
charts project. 

To save a query:

.. include:: /includes/steps/save-agg-pipeline-query.rst 

.. _charts-query-library-load:

Load Saved Queries 
------------------

To use a previously saved query from the :guilabel:`Query Library` on 
a chart, use the :guilabel:`Library` dropdown to load the saved query. 
You can access queries saved by any user in the project. 

To load saved queries:

.. include:: /includes/steps/load-saved-agg-pipeline-query.rst

.. _charts-query-library-modify-disconnect:

Modify or Disconnect Saved Queries 
----------------------------------

After you :ref:`load a saved query <charts-query-library-load>`, you 
can modify or disconnect the query from the library. 

**To modify**, make changes to the query in the query bar and save the 
query under its original name, only if you created the query or have 
the :authrole:`Project Owner` role, or save the query under a new name. 
  
If you save the modified query under the same name, all other charts 
using the same named query will inherit the modified query for reuse.

If you save the modified query in the library under a new name, the 
modified query, although unused by other charts initially, will be 
available for reuse in the future.

**To disconnect**, modify the query in the query bar and click 
:guilabel:`Apply` after changing the query. The query is disconnected 
from the library, which makes the modified query *private* to this 
chart. You must save the query to the library if you wish to reuse this 
query on other charts in the future. If you save the query under the 
same name in the library, all charts connected to it will inherit the 
new query.

Alternatively, click :guilabel:`Revert` before applying the query to 
the chart to undo the changes.

.. _charts-query-library-manage:

Manage Saved Queries 
--------------------

When you :ref:`load a saved query <charts-query-library-load>`, the 
query author or user with the :authrole:`Project Owner` role can 
rename or delete the queries in the library.

.. include:: /includes/steps/manage-saved-agg-pipeline-query.rst
