# MongoDB Documentation Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that follow
tutorials and code examples in MongoDB's official [Atlas Vector Search documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/). You can run, download, and modify these notebooks as you learn how to use MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for your use case.

## Overview

Each notebook corresponds to a page or example in our documentation.
Refer to the docs page linked in each notebook for prerequisites, set-up instructions, and detailed explanations of the code.

The following table summarizes the contents of the notebooks in each directory:
