Synopsis
--------

The :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` utility makes it possible to manipulate files
stored in your MongoDB instance in :term:`GridFS` objects from the
command line. It is particularly useful as it provides an interface
between objects stored in your file system and GridFS.

All :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` commands have the following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongofiles <options> <commands> <filename>

The components of the :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` command are:

1. :ref:`Options <mongofiles-options>`. You may use one or more of
   these options to control the behavior of :binary:`~bin.mongofiles`.

2. :ref:`Commands <mongofiles-commands>`. Use one of these commands to
   determine the action of :binary:`~bin.mongofiles`.

3. A filename which is either: the name of a file on your local's file
   system, or a GridFS object.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/require-cmd-line-mongofiles.rst

.. important:: For :term:`replica sets <replica set>`,
   :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` can only read from the set's
   :term:`primary`.

Required Access
---------------

In order to connect to a :binary:`~bin.mongod` that enforces authorization
with the :option:`--auth <mongod --auth>` option, you must use the
:option:`--username <mongofiles --username>` and :option:`--password
<mongofiles --password>` options. The connecting user must possess, at a
minimum:

- the :authrole:`read` role for the accessed database when using the
  ``list``, ``search`` or ``get`` commands,

- the :authrole:`readWrite` role for the accessed database when using
  the ``put`` or ``delete`` commands.

Read Preference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` uses read preference
:readmode:`primary`. To override the default, you can specify the
:ref:`read preference <replica-set-read-preference>` in the
:option:`--readPreference <mongofiles --readPreference>` command line
option or in the :option:`--uri connection string <mongofiles --uri>`.

Starting in version 4.2, if you specify read preference in the URI
string and the :option:`--readPreference <mongofiles
--readPreference>`, the :option:`--readPreference <mongofiles
--readPreference>` value overrides the read preference specified in the
URI string.

In earlier versions, the two options are incompatible.

Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 4.2, you can specify both the
:option:`--writeConcern <mongofiles --writeConcern>` and the
:option:`--uri connection string <mongofiles --uri>` option. If write
concern is specified using both options, the
:option:`--writeConcern <mongofiles --writeConcern>` value overrides
the write concern specified in the URI string.

In earlier versions, the two options are incompatible.

.. _mongofiles-commands:

Commands
--------

.. describe:: list <prefix>

   Lists the files in the GridFS store. The characters specified after
   ``list`` (e.g. ``<prefix>``) optionally limit the list of
   returned items to files that begin with that string of characters.

.. describe:: search <string>

   Lists the files in the GridFS store with names that match any
   portion of ``<string>``.

.. describe:: put <filename>

   Copy the specified file from the local file system into GridFS
   storage.

   Here, ``<filename>`` refers to the name the object will have in
   GridFS, and :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` assumes that this reflects the name the
   file has on the local file system. If the local filename is
   different use the :option:`mongofiles --local` option.

.. describe:: get <filename>

   Copy the specified file from GridFS storage to the local file
   system.

   Here, ``<filename>`` refers to the name the object will have in
   GridFS. :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` writes the file to the local
   file system using the file's ``filename`` in GridFS. To choose a
   different location for the file on the local file system, use the
   :option:`--local <mongofiles --local>` option.

.. describe:: get_id "<_id>"

   .. versionadded:: 3.2.0

   Copy the file, specified by its ``<_id>``, from GridFS storage to the
   local file system.

   Here ``<_id>`` refers to the extended JSON ``_id`` of the
   object in GridFS:

   - Starting in MongoDB 4.2, ``get_id`` can accept either ObjectId
     values or non-ObjectId values for ``<_id>``.

   - In MongoDB 4.0 and earlier, ``get_id`` only   
     accepts ``<ObjectId>`` values.
   
   :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` writes the file to the local
   file system using the file's ``filename`` in GridFS. To choose a
   different location for the file on the local file system, use the
   :option:`--local <mongofiles --local>` option.

.. describe:: delete <filename>

   Delete the specified file from GridFS storage.

.. describe:: delete_id "<_id>"

   .. versionadded:: 3.2.0

   Delete the file, specified by its ``<_id>``, from GridFS storage:

   - Starting in MongoDB 4.2, ``delete_id`` can accept    
     either ObjectId values or non-ObjectId values for ``<_id>``. 

   - In MongoDB 4.0 and earlier, ``delete_id`` only   
     accepts ``<ObjectId>`` values.

Examples
--------

To return a list of all files in a :term:`GridFS` collection in the
``records`` database, use the following invocation at the system shell:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongofiles -d records list

This :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` instance will connect to the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance running on the ``27017`` localhost
interface to specify the same operation on a different port or
hostname, and issue a command that resembles one of the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongofiles --port 37017 -d records list
   mongofiles --host db1.example.net -d records list
   mongofiles --host db1.example.net --port 37017 -d records list

Modify any of the following commands as needed if you're connecting
the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances on different ports or hosts.

To upload a file named ``32-corinth.lp`` to the GridFS collection in
the ``records`` database, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongofiles -d records put 32-corinth.lp

To delete the ``32-corinth.lp`` file from this GridFS collection in
the ``records`` database, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongofiles -d records delete 32-corinth.lp

To search for files in the GridFS collection in the ``records``
database that have the string ``corinth`` in their names, you can use
following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongofiles -d records search corinth

To list all files in the GridFS collection in the ``records`` database
that begin with the string ``32``, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongofiles -d records list 32

To fetch the file from the GridFS collection in the ``records``
database named ``32-corinth.lp``, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongofiles -d records get 32-corinth.lp

To fetch the file from the GridFS collection in the ``records`` database
with ``_id: ObjectId("56feac751f417d0357e7140f")``, you can use
the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongofiles -d records get_id 'ObjectId("56feac751f417d0357e7140f")'

You must include quotation marks around the ``_id``.
