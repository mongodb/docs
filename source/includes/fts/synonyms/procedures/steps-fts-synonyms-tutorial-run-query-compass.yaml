  |fts| query results vary based on the type of word mapping defined in 
  the synonyms source collection.

  .. tabs:: 

     .. tab:: equivalent Mapping Type
        :tabid: equivalent

        The query searches the ``title`` field for the word 
        ``automobile`` and uses the synonym mapping definition named 
        ``transportSynonyms`` to search for words configured as 
        synonyms of the query word ``automobile`` in the synonyms 
        source collection named ``transport_synonyms``. The query includes the 
        following stages: 

        - :manual:`$limit </reference/operator/aggregation/limit>` 
          stage to limit the output to 10 results 
        - :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` 
          stage to exclude all fields except ``title`` and add a field 
          named ``score``

        To run this query in |compass|:

        a. Click the :guilabel:`Aggregations` tab.
        #. Click :guilabel:`Select...`, then configure each of the 
           following pipeline stages by selecting the stage from the 
           dropdown and adding the query for that stage. Click 
           :guilabel:`Add Stage` to add additional stages.
