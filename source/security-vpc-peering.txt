   :class: note

   |service| supports :ref:`VPC <security-vpc>` peering with other AWS VPCs in
   the same region.

For |service| clusters backed by :ref:`google-gcp`, use :doc:`Group IP
Whitelisting </security-whitelist>` to allow your :abbr:`GCP (Google Cloud
Platform)` services to access the |service| group.

.. important::

   To set up a VPC peering connection, you must be the group owner.

From the :guilabel:`Clusters` view, select the :guilabel:`Security`
tab, then click :guilabel:`Peering`, then :guilabel:`New Peering
Connection`.

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/steps/add-vpc-connection.rst

Once set up, you can edit or terminate VPC peering connection from the
:guilabel:`Peering` table.

To use, you must add your VPC CIDR block address (or subset) or the
Security Group associated with the peer VPC to the :ref:`whitelist
<whitelist>`.
