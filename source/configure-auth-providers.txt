|charts| uses tokens passed with the Embedding SDK to authenticate users
who want to view embedded charts or dashboards that require 
authentication.

|charts-short| doesn't render the chart or dashboard in any of the 
following scenarios:

- The details in the token don't match criteria you specify.
- The token is invalid.
- A token isn't present.

Considerations
--------------
- You must be an |service|
  :atlas:`Project Owner </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>` to
  configure embedding authentication providers for your linked 
  |charts-short| instance.

- |charts-short| supports these authentication providers:

  - :stitch:`Realm </authentication/>`
  - Google
  - Custom |jwt|

Realm Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|charts-short| considers tokens from Realm providers valid if they:

- Are syntactically valid |jwt|\s.

- Are issued by the relevant authority.

- Match the Realm App ID you configure the provider to accept.

Google Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|charts-short| considers tokens from Google providers valid if they:

- Are syntactically valid |jwt|\s.

- Are issued by the relevant authority.

- Match the Google Client ID you configure the provider to accept.

JWT Providers
