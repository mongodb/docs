Manage the Monitoring and Backup Agents with Automation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When configured so, Automation can maintain a deployments
Monitoring and Backup agents. You can configure Automation to maintain
one or both agent type. Automated maintenance includes starting a fresh
agent if necessary, restarting an agent stops, and upgrading
or downgrading the agent to the most stable version as needed.

Automation allows only one agent per machine for per agent type and
will remove additional agents. For example, when maintaining Backup
Agents, automation will remove one of the Backup
Agents from a machine that has two Backup Agents.

Automation maintains agents only if the configured appropriately in
the :doc:`cluster configuration file
</reference/cluster-configuration>`:

- To automate the maintenance of **Monitoring Agents**, add each
  Monitoring Agent's information to the :data:`monitoringVersions`
  array in the :doc:`cluster configuration file
  </reference/cluster-configuration>`.

- To automate the maintenance of **Backup Agents**, add each Backup
  Agent's information to the :data:`backupVersions` array in the
  :doc:`cluster configuration file
  </reference/cluster-configuration>`.
