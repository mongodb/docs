===================================
Enable Backup for a Sharded Cluster
===================================

.. start-content
   
To backup a sharded cluster, you need to enable the cluster for backup.

.. note::
   The sharded-cluster must be MongoDB version 2.4 or later.

To enable the cluster,

#. Go to :guilabel:`Backups`.

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Sharded Cluster` tab to see the list of your
   replica sets and their backup details.

#. For the sharded cluster you want to enable, select
   :guilabel:`Enabled` in the :guilabel:`Status` column.

#. Specify which instances to you want to use for the initial sync. To
   minimize the impact on the primaries, sync off of the secondaries.

Your MongoDB Backup Service Agent will start polling the the specified
instance for this sharded cluster.
