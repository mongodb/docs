  a. (Optional) Click the :icon-fa4:`pencil` for the:
  
     - :guilabel:`Data Lake` to specify a name for your {+dl+}. 
       Defaults to ``Data Lake[n]``. 

     - Database to edit the database name. Defaults to ``Database[n]``. 

       Corresponds to :datalakeconf:`databases.[n].name` |json| 
       configuration setting.

     - Collection to edit the collection name. Defaults to 
       ``Collection[n]``. 
       
       Corresponds to :datalakeconf:`databases.[n].collections.name` 
       |json| configuration setting.

     - View to edit the view name. 

     You can click: 
     
     - :guilabel:`Create Database` to add databases and collections. 
     - :icon-fa4:`plus` associated with the database to add collections 
       to the database. 
     - :icon-fa4:`plus` associated with the collection to add 
       :manual:`views </core/views/>` on the collection. To create a 
       view, you must specify: 
       
       - The name of the view.
       - The :manual:`pipeline 
         </core/aggregation-pipeline/#std-label-aggregation-pipeline>` 
         to apply to the view.

         .. note:: 

            The view definition pipeline cannot include the ``$out`` or 
            the ``$merge`` stage. If the view definition includes 
            nested pipeline stages such as ``$lookup`` or ``$facet``, 
            this restriction applies to those nested pipelines as well.

       To learn more about views, see: 

       - :manual:`Views </core/views/>`
       - :manual:`db.createView </reference/method/db.createView/>`

     - :icon-fa4:`trash-o` associated with the database, collection, or 
       view to remove it.

  #. Drag and drop the data store to map with the collection.

     Corresponds to 
     :datalakeconf:`databases.[n].collections.[n].dataSources` |json| 
     configuration setting.
