title: Create the data directory.
stepnum: 1
ref: create-dbpath
pre: |
  Before you start MongoDB for the first time, create the directory to
  which the :program:`mongod` process will write data. By default, the
  :program:`mongod` process uses the ``/data/db`` directory. If you create
  a directory other than this one, you must specify that directory in the
  :setting:`dbpath` option when starting the :program:`mongod` process
  later in this procedure.
action:
  pre: |
    The following example command creates the default ``/data/db`` directory:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mkdir -p /data/db
---
title: Set permissions for the data directory.
stepnum: 2
ref: set-dbpath-permission
action:
  pre: |
    Before running :program:`mongod` for the first time, ensure that the
    user account running :program:`mongod` has read and write permissions
    for the directory.
---
title: Run MongoDB.
stepnum: 3
ref: start-mdb
pre: |
  To run MongoDB, run the :program:`mongod` process at the system prompt.
  If necessary, specify the path of the :program:`mongod` or data
  directory. See the following examples.
action:
  - heading: Run without specifying paths
    pre: |
      If your system ``PATH`` variable includes the location of the
      :program:`mongod` binary and if you use the default data directory
      (i.e., ``/data/db``), simply enter ``mongod`` at the system prompt:
    language: sh
    code: |
      mongod
  - heading: Specify the path of the :program:`mongod`
    pre: |
      If your ``PATH`` does not include the location of the
      :program:`mongod` binary, enter the full path to the :program:`mongod`
      binary at the system prompt:
    language: sh
    code: |
      <path to binary>/mongod
  - heading: Specify the path of the data directory
    pre: |
      If you do not use the default data directory (i.e., ``/data/db``),
      specify the path to the data directory using the :option:`--dbpath
      <mongod --dbpath>` option:
    language: sh
    code: |
      mongod --dbpath <path to data directory>
---
title: Stop MongoDB as needed.
stepnum: 4
ref: stop-mdb
pre: |
  To stop MongoDB, press ``Control+C`` in the terminal where the
  :program:`mongod` instance is running.
---
title: Begin using MongoDB.
stepnum: 5
ref: begin
pre: |
  To begin using MongoDB, see :doc:`/tutorial/getting-started`.
