Sources of Data Transfer Costs
------------------------------

|service| data transfer costs depend on the cloud service provider
where you deployed the cluster. Multi-region clusters may have higher
data transfer costs depending on the number and location of additional
regions, as well as the number of clusters deployed to each region.

|service| tabulates data transfer costs daily.

.. admonition:: Exceptions to Data Transfer Cost
   :class: note

   |service| doesn't charge for data transfer for:

   - Incoming or outgoing data on ``M0``, ``M2``, or ``M5`` cluster
     tiers.

   - Incoming data to an |service| node.

|aws|
~~~~~

|service| charges for data transfer between the |service| node and
another node. Data transfer charges increase, from lowest to highest,
when you transfer data between your |service| node and another node:

- In the same |aws| region.

- In a different |aws| region.

- Outside of any |aws| region, excluding incoming transfers to the
  |service| node.

|gcp|
~~~~~

|service| charges for data transfer between the |service| node and
another node. Data transfer charges increase, from lowest to highest,
when you transfer data between your |service| node and another node:

- In the same region but in different zones.

- In different regions in the United States of America.

- On a different continent.

- On the same continent (excluding USA) but a different region.

- Outside of a |gcp| data center, excluding incoming transfers to the
  |service| node.

|azure|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| charges for data transfer between your |service| node and
another node. Data transfer charges increase, from lowest to highest,
when you transfer data between your |service| node and another node:

- Between Availability Zones. |service| on |azure| uses Availability
  Zones in new cluster deployments in regions that support them.

- Using in-region VNet peering.

- In a different region. Data transfer charges for an |service| cluster
  depend on the geographic location of the source node.

- Using cross-region VNet peering.

Live Migrate Your Data to |service|
-----------------------------------

MongoDB hosts and operates the free |service| Live Migration Service to
help users migrate existing MongoDB databases to |service-fullname|.
MongoDB doesn't charge for any incoming data transfers to an |service|
cluster. :website:`Learn more </cloud/atlas/migrate?tck=docs_atlas>`

How to Reduce Data Transfer Costs
---------------------------------

The vast majority of |service| customers spend less than 10% of their
budget on data transfer. If you are spending significantly more, some
of these optimizations may reduce your data transfer costs:

- Check all applications and processes that access your data for
  inefficiencies. Ensure that queries do not:

  - Re-read data that already exists on the client.

  - Re-write existing data to your cluster.

- Ensure that queries originate from the same cloud
  region and provider as your |service| cluster whenever possible.

  When cross-region queries are necessary:

  - Ensure read queries
    :manual:`use the preference "nearest."</core/read-preference>`

  - Source write queries from your :guilabel:`Highest Priority Region`
    whenever possible. For more information on region priorities, see
    :ref:`Electable Nodes for High Availability
    <deploy-across-multiple-regions>`.

- Use the :manual:`Aggregation Framework </aggregation>` to preprocess
  your data before you transfer it. For example, you can project
  document fields using the :pipeline:`$project` aggregation stage to
  reduce the size of a document before you transfer it.

- Ensure that your client driver
  :manual:`uses wire protocol compression </reference/configuration-options#net.compression.compressors>`
  to communicate with MongoDB. |service| always compresses intra-cluster communication. To learn how to configure
  your driver, refer to your :driver:`Driver's Documentation </>`.

.. note::

   Queries from non-cloud environments into |service|, across cloud
   providers, or between continents on the same cloud provider incur
   the greatest data transfer costs.
