Overview
--------

.. short-description::
   
   Configure a network connection to allow your users to access the 
   database deployments in your project.

After creating your cluster, Atlas directs you to a page called
:guilabel:`Security Quickstart`. In the previous guide, we completed the
first section, which added a user to the database. 

In this guide, you will configure a network connection with the
last section of the page.

What You'll Need
----------------

- A MongoDB account. See :ref:`guides-create-atlas-account`.
- An Atlas cluster. See :ref:`guides-create-a-cluster`.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Select :guilabel:`My Local Environment`.

      In the :guilabel:`Where would you like to connect from?` section,
      select the box labeled :guilabel:`My Local Environment`.

      .. figure:: /images/network-env.png
         :figwidth: 600px
         :alt: network-env
      
   .. step:: Add your IP address

      In the box labeled :guilabel:`Add entries to your IP Access List`, 
      click :guilabel:`Add My Current IP Address`.

      .. figure:: /images/network-ip.png
         :figwidth: 600px

      Now, you see your IP address at the bottom of the box.
