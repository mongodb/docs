1. Have either the :authrole:`Project Owner` or
   :authrole:`Organization Owner` role in |service|.

#. Have an |aws| user account with an |iam| user policy that
   grants permissions to create, modify, describe, and delete
   endpoints. For more information on controlling the use of
   interface endpoints, see the :aws:`AWS Documentation 
   </vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html>`.

#. **(Recommended)**:
   :aws:`Install the AWS CLI 
   </cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html>`.

#. If you have not already done so, create your |vpc| and EC2
   instances in |aws|. See the :aws:`AWS documentation
   </index.html>` for guidance.
