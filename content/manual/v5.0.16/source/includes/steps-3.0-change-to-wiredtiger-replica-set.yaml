content: |
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` with WiredTiger will not start if the
  :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` directory contains data files created with a
  different storage engine.

  For the stopped secondary member, either delete the content of the
  data directory or create a new data directory. If creating a new
  directory, ensure that the user account running :binary:`~bin.mongod` has
  read and write permissions for the new directory.

title: "Restart the secondary member with WiredTiger."
level: 5
ref: 3.0-upgrade-restart-secondary-w-wiredtiger
pre: |
  Restart the 3.0 :binary:`~bin.mongod`, specifying ``wiredTiger`` as the
  :option:`--storageEngine <mongod --storageEngine>` and the data directory for WiredTiger as
  the :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>`. Specify additional options as appropriate for
  the member.
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
     mongod --storageEngine wiredTiger --dbpath <newWiredTigerDBPath>
post: |
  Since no data exists in the ``--dbpath``, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` will
  perform an initial sync. The length of the initial sync process
  depends on the size of the database and network connection between
  members of the replica set.
