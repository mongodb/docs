## Summary emphasizes defining zones/ranges before sharding

ref: zoned-sharding-pre-define-zone
content: |

   By defining the zones and the zone ranges *before* sharding an empty
   or a non-existing collection, the shard collection operation creates
   chunks for the defined zone ranges as well as any additional chunks
   to cover the entire range of the shard key values and performs an
   initial chunk distribution based on the zone ranges. This initial
   creation and distribution of chunks allows for faster setup of zoned
   sharding. After the initial distribution, the balancer manages the
   chunk distribution going forward.
   
   See :ref:`pre-define-zone-range-example` for an example.

## Summary emphasizes sharding operation can distribute chunks

ref: zoned-sharding-shard-operation-chunk-distribution
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.0.3, the shard collection operation can
   perform an initial chunk creation and distribution for empty or
   non-existing collections if :doc:`zones and zone ranges
   </core/zone-sharding>` have been defined for the collection. Initial
   creation and distribution of chunk allows for faster setup of zoned
   sharding. After the initial distribution, the balancer manages the
   chunk distribution going forward per usual.

   The shard collection operation (i.e. :dbcommand:`shardCollection`
   command and the :method:`sh.shardCollection()` helper) can perform
   initial chunk creation and distribution for an empty or a
   non-existing collection if :doc:`zones and zone ranges
   </core/zone-sharding>` have been defined for the collection. Initial
   chunk distribution allows for a faster setup of zoned sharding.
   After the initial distribution, the balancer manages the chunk
   distribution going forward per usual.

content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.0.2, you can run
   :dbcommand:`updateZoneKeyRange` database command and its helpers
   :method:`sh.updateZoneKeyRange()` and :method:`sh.addTagRange()` on
   an unsharded collection or a non-existing collection.

   Starting in MongoDB 4.0.2, dropping a collection deletes its
   associated zone/tag ranges.
