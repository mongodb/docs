title: Disable the Balancer (Optional)
level: 4
ref: sharding_tiered_storage_stop_balancer
pre: |
  To reduce performance impacts, the balancer may be disabled on the collection
  to ensure no migrations take place while configuring the new tags.
action:
  - pre: |
      Use :method:`sh.disableBalancing()`, specifying the namespace of the
      collection, to stop the balancer.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.disableBalancing("chat.message")
post: |
  Use :method:`sh.isBalancerRunning()` to check if the balancer process 
  is currently running. Wait until any current balancing rounds have completed
  before proceeding.

title: Tag each shard
level: 4
ref: sharding_pinning-applications-tag-shards
action:
  - pre: |
      Tag each shard in the North American data center with the ``NA`` tag.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.addShardTag(<shard name>, "NA")
  - pre: |
      Tag each shard in the European data center with the ``EU`` tag.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.addShardTag(<shard name>, "EU")
post: |
  You can review the tags assigned to any given shard by running 
  :method:`sh.status()`.

title: Define ranges for each tag
level: 4
ref: sharding_pinning-applications-define-ranges
action:  
  - pre: |
      For shard key values where ``country : US``, define a shard key range
      and associate it to the ``NA`` tag using the :method:`sh.addTagRange()`
      method. This method requires:
        
      * The full namespace of the target collection. 
      * The inclusive lower bound of the range. 
      * The exclusive upper bound of the range. 
      * The name of the tag.
      
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.addTagRange( 
        "chat.messages",
        { "country" : "US", "userid" : MinKey },
        { "country" : "US", "userid" : MaxKey }, 
        "NA"
      )
  - pre: |
      For shard key values where ``country : UK``, define a shard key range
      and associate it to the ``EU`` tag using the :method:`sh.addTagRange()`
      method. This method requires:
      
      * The full namespace of the target collection. 
      * The inclusive lower bound of the range. 
      * The exclusive upper bound of the range. 
      * The name of the tag.
      
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.addTagRange( 
        "chat.messages",
        { "country" : "UK", "userid" : MinKey },
        { "country" : "UK", "userid" : MaxKey }, 
        "EU"
      )
  - pre: |
      For shard key values where ``country : DE``, define a shard key range
      and associate it to the ``EU`` tag using the :method:`sh.addTagRange()`
      method. This method requires:
      
      * The full namespace of the target collection. 
      * The inclusive lower bound of the range. 
      * The exclusive upper bound of the range. 
      * The name of the tag.
      
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.addTagRange( 
        "chat.messages",
        { "country" : "DE", "userid" : MinKey },
        { "country" : "DE", "userid" : MaxKey }, 
        "EU"
      )
post: |
  The :bsontype:`MinKey` and :bsontype:`MaxKey` values are reserved special 
  value for comparisons. :bsontype:`MinKey` always compares as lower than every
  other possible value, while :bsontype:`MaxKey` always compares as higher than
  every other possible value. The configured ranges captures every user for
  each ``device``. 
   
  Both ``country : UK`` and ``country : DE`` are assigned to the ``EU`` tag. 
  This associates any document with either ``UK`` or ``DE`` as the value for
  ``country`` to the EU data center.

title: Enable the Balancer (Optional)
level: 4
ref: sharding_tiered_storage_start_balancer
pre: |
  If the balancer was disabled in previous steps, re-enable the balancer at
  the completion of this procedure to rebalance the cluster.
action:
  - pre: |
      Use :method:`sh.enableBalancing()`, specifying the namespace of the
      collection, to start the balancer.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.enableBalancing("chat.message")
post: |
  Use :method:`sh.isBalancerRunning()` to check if the balancer process 
  is currently running.

stepnum: 5
title: Review the Changes
level: 4
ref: sharding_tiered_storage_review
pre: |
  The next time the :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` runs, it 
  :ref:`splits <sharding-chunk-split>` chunks where necessary and
  :ref:`migrates <sharding-chunk-migration>` chunks across the 
  shards respecting the tag ranges and tags.
  
  Once balancing finishes, the shards tagged as ``NA`` should only
  contain documents with ``country : NA``, while shards tagged as ``EU``
  should only contain documents with ``country : UK`` or ``country : DE``. 
  
  A document with a value for ``country`` other than ``NA``, ``UK``, or 
  ``DE`` can reside on any shard in the cluster.
  
  You can confirm the chunk distribution by running :method:`sh.status()`.
