Refining a collection's shard key allows for a more fine-grained
data distribution and can address situations where the existing key
has led to :ref:`jumbo chunks <jumbo-chunks>` due to insufficient
:ref:`cardinality <shard-key-cardinality>`.

.. include:: /includes/refine-shard-key-index-type.rst

.. note::

   Starting in MongoDB 5.0, you can also :ref:`reshard your collection
   <sharding-resharding>` by providing a new shard key for the
   collection. To learn whether you should reshard your collection 
   or refine your shard key, see :ref:`change-a-shard-key`.

To refine a collection's shard key, use the
:dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command. The
:dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` adds a suffix field
or fields to the existing key to create the new shard key.

For example, you may have an existing ``orders`` collection in a
``test`` database with the shard key ``{ customer_id: 1 }``. You can
use the :dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command to change the
shard key to the new shard key ``{ customer_id: 1, order_id: 1 }``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( {
      refineCollectionShardKey: "test.orders",
      key: { customer_id: 1, order_id: 1 }
   } )
