Overview
--------

Use the guides on this page to identify the potentially *breaking changes* that each
version of the {+driver-short+} introduces. This page also provides information about
breaking compatibility changes between the driver and MongoDB.

A breaking change is a modification of a convention or a behavior starting in
a specific version of the driver. This type of change may prevent your application from
working properly if you don't address it.

.. tip:: {+stable-api+}

   To minimize the number of changes your application might require when
   you upgrade driver versions in the future, consider using the
   :ref:`{+stable-api+} <csharp-stable-api>`.

Server Release Compatibility Changes
------------------------------------

A server release compatibility change is a modification
to the {+driver-long+} that discontinues support for a set of
{+mdb-server+} versions.

The driver discontinues support for a {+mdb-server+} version after it reaches
end-of-life (EOL).

To learn more about the MongoDB support for EOL products,
see the `Legacy Support Policy <https://www.mongodb.com/support-policy/legacy>`__.

.. _csharp-server-8.1-incompatibility:

Server Version 8.1 Support Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot use v2.14.1 or earlier versions of the {+driver-short+} to connect to a
deployment running {+mdb-server+} v8.1. Starting in {+mdb-server+} v8.1,
the ``buildinfo`` command requires authentication, causing an
incompatibility with these driver versions.
