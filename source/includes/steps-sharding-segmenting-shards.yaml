title: Disable the Balancer
stepnum: 1
level: 4
ref: sharding_tiered_storage_stop_balancer
pre: |
  The balancer must be disabled on the collection
  to ensure no migrations take place while configuring the new tags.
action:
  - pre: |
      Use :method:`sh.disableBalancing()`, specifying the namespace of the
      collection, to stop the balancer.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.disableBalancing("chat.message")
post: |
  Use :method:`sh.isBalancerRunning()` to check if the balancer process 
  is currently running. Wait until any current balancing rounds have completed
  before proceeding.

title: Tag each shard
level: 4
ref: sharding_pinning-applications-tag-shards
action:
  - pre: |
      Tag ``shard0000`` with the ``robot`` tag.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.addShardTag("shard0000", "robot")
  - pre: |
      Tag ``shard0001`` with the ``robot`` tag.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.addShardTag("shard0001", "robot")
  - pre: |
      Tag ``shard0002`` with the ``fruitos`` tag.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.addShardTag("shard0002", "fruitos")
  - pre: |
      Tag ``shard0003`` with the ``fruitos`` tag.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.addShardTag("shard0003", "fruitos")
post: |
  Run :method:`sh.status()` to review the tags configured for the sharded
  cluster.

title: Define ranges for each tag
level: 4
ref: sharding_pinning-applications-define-ranges
action:
  - pre: |
      Define range for the ``robot`` client and associate it to the ``robot`` 
      tag using the :method:`sh.addTagRange()` method. 
      
      This method requires: 
        
      * The full namespace of the target collection
      
      * The inclusive lower bound of the range
      
      * The exclusive upper bound of the range 
      
      * The name of the tag
      
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.addTagRange( 
        "gamify.users",
        { "client" : "robot", "userid" : MinKey },
        { "client" : "robot", "userid" : MaxKey }, 
        "robot"
      )
  - pre: |
      Define range for the ``fruitos`` client and associate it to the 
      ``fruitos`` tag using the :method:`sh.addTagRange()` method.
      
      This method requires: 
      
      * The full namespace of the target collection
      * The inclusive lower bound of the range
      * The exclusive upper bound of the range 
      * The name of the tag
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.addTagRange( 
        "gamify.users",
        { "client" : "fruitos", "userid" : MinKey },
        { "client" : "fruitos", "userid" : MaxKey }, 
        "fruitos"
      )
post: |

  The :bsontype:`MinKey` and :bsontype:`MaxKey` values are reserved special
  values for comparisons. :bsontype:`MinKey` always compares as lower than
  every other possible value, while :bsontype:`MaxKey` always compares as
  higher than every other possible value. The configured ranges captures every
  user for each ``client``.

title: Enable the Balancer
level: 4
ref: sharding_tiered_storage_start_balancer
pre: |
  Re-enable the balancer to rebalance the cluster.
action:
  - pre: |
      Use :method:`sh.enableBalancing()`, specifying the namespace of the
      collection, to start the balancer.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.enableBalancing("chat.message")
post: |
  Use :method:`sh.isBalancerRunning()` to check if the balancer process 
  is currently running.

stepnum: 5
title: Review the changes
level: 4
ref: sharding_tiered_storage_review
pre: |
  The next time the :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` runs, it 
  :ref:`splits <sharding-chunk-split>` and
  :ref:`migrates <sharding-chunk-migration>` chunks across the 
  shards respecting the tag ranges and tags. 
  
  Once balancing finishes, the shards tagged as ``robot`` only
  contain documents with ``client : robot``, while shards tagged as ``fruitos``
  only contain documents with ``client : fruitos``.
  
  You can confirm the chunk distribution by running :method:`sh.status()`.
