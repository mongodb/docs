Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: grantPrivilegesToRole

   Assigns additional privileges to a :ref:`user-defined
   <user-defined-roles>` role defined on the database on which the
   command is run. The :dbcommand:`grantPrivilegesToRole` command uses
   the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { grantPrivilegesToRole: "<role>",
        privileges: [
                      { resource: { <resource> }, actions: [ "<action>", ... ] },
                      ...
                    ],
        writeConcern: { <write concern> }
      }

   The :dbcommand:`grantPrivilegesToRole` command has the following
   fields:

   .. include:: /reference/command/grantPrivilegesToRole-field.rst

Required Access
---------------

To issue the :dbcommand:`grantPrivilegesToRole` command, a user must
have access that includes the :authaction:`grantAnyRole` action for the
database the privilege targets. To grant a privilege on multiple
databases or on the ``cluster`` resource, a user must have access that includes
:authaction:`grantAnyRole` action on the ``admin`` database.

Example
-------

The following :dbcommand:`grantPrivilegesToRole` command grants two
additional privileges to the ``service`` role that exists in the
database that the command is run:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { grantPrivilegesToRole: "service",
     privileges: [
       { resource: { db: "products", collection: "" }, actions: [ "find" ] },
       { resource: { db: "", collection: "system.indexes" }, actions: [ "find" ] }
     ],
     writeConcern: { w: "majority" , wtimeout: 5000 }
   }

The first privilege in the ``privileges`` array allows the user to
search on all non-system collections in the ``products`` database. The
privilege does not allow searches on :doc:`system collections
</reference/system-collections>`, such as the :data:`system.indexes
<<database>.system.indexes>` collection. To grant access to these
system collections, explicitly provision access in the ``privileges``
array. See :doc:`/reference/resource-document`.

The second privilege explicitly allows the :authaction:`find` action on
:data:`system.indexes <<database>.system.indexes>` collections on all
databases.
