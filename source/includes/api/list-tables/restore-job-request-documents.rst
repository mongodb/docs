     - The number of hours the download :abbr:`URL (Uniform Resource
       Locator)` is valid once the restore job is complete.

       Only needed if ``"delivery.methodName" : "HTTP"``.

   * - delivery.formatName
     - string
     - Format in which data from an :abbr:`SCP (secure copy)` restore
       should be written to the destination. Value may be one of the
       following:

       Only needed if ``"delivery.methodName" : "SCP"``.

   * - delivery.hostname
     - string
     - Hostname of the server to which the data should be written
       for an :abbr:`SCP (secure copy)` restore.

       Only needed if ``"delivery.methodName" : "SCP"``.

   * - delivery.maxDownloads
     - number
     - The number of times the download :abbr:`URL (Uniform Resource
       Locator)` can be used. This must be ``1`` or greater.

       Only needed if ``"delivery.methodName" : "HTTP"``.

       .. note::

          If you specify ``AUTOMATED_RESTORE`` in the request , the
          response shows the ``delivery.methodName`` as ``HTTP``. An
          automated restore uses the ``HTTP`` method to deliver the
          restore job to the target host.

       .. important::

          - If your group (``GROUP-ID``) has the client-side :abbr:`PIT
            (point-in-time)` restore feature enabled, including
            ``timestamp`` in your request results in an error.

          - If your group (``GROUP-ID``) does not have the client-side
            :abbr:`PIT (point-in-time)` restore feature enabled,
            including ``timestamp`` in your request triggers a
            server-side :abbr:`PIT (point-in-time)` restore job.
