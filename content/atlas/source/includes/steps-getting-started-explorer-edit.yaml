  You can use the {+atlas-ui+}'s :guilabel:`Filter` bar
  to search for specific documents. The following query filters the
  documents in the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection for movies with
  the ``title`` Titanic and the ``year`` 1997.
  
  a. Copy the following filter into your filter bar:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { "title": "Titanic", "year": 1997 }

  #. Click :guilabel:`Find`.
 
     The {+atlas-ui+} should return a single document
     after you apply this filter.
