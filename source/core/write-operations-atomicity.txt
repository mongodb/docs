Atomicity
---------

In MongoDB, a write operation is atomic on the level of a single
document, even if the operation modifies multiple embedded documents
*within* a single document. 

Multi-Document Transactions

Concurrency Control
-------------------

Concurrency control allows multiple applications to run concurrently
without causing data inconsistency or conflicts.

One approach is to create a :ref:`unique index <index-type-unique>` on a
field that can only have unique values. This prevents insertions or
updates from creating duplicate data. Create a unique index on multiple
fields to force uniqueness on that combination of field values. For
examples of use cases, see :ref:`update() and Unique Index
<update-with-unique-indexes>` and :ref:`findAndModify() and Unique Index
<upsert-and-unique-index>`.

Another approach is to specify the expected current value of a field in
the query predicate for the write operations.
