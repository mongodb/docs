ref: _alert-status
content: |
  When |mms| detects an alert condition, it opens an alert. If the {{alert}}
  configuration contains no notification delay, the alert status goes
  immediately to ``OPEN``. If the configuration contains a delay, |mms| sets
  the alert to ``TRACKING`` until the delay period ends, after which |mms|
  sets the alert to ``OPEN`` if the condition persists.

  If the {{alert}} configuration has multiple notifications, each with its own
  notification delay, |mms| uses the smallest delay value to determine when to
  move an alert from ``TRACKING`` to ``OPEN``. An alert configuration sets
  notification delay in the ``delayMin`` field in the ``notification`` array.
