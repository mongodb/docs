.. method:: db.createView()

   .. note::

      The following page discusses views. For discussion of on-demand
      materialized views, see :pipeline:`$merge` instead.

   Creates a :doc:`view </core/views>` as the result of the applying
   the specified :ref:`aggregation pipeline <aggregation-pipeline>` to
   the source collection or view. Views act as read-only collections,
   and are computed on demand during read operations. You must create
   views in the same database as the source collection. MongoDB
   executes read operations on views as part of the underlying
   aggregation pipeline.

Syntax
------

``db.createView`` has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createView(<view>, <source>, <pipeline>, <options>)

The method accepts the following parameters:


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Parameter

     - Type

     - Description

   * - ``view``

     - string

     - The name of the view to create.
       
       

   * - ``source``

     - string

     - The name of the source collection or view from which to create the
       view. The name is not the full namespace of the collection or
       view; i.e. does not include the database name and implies the same
       database as the view to create. You must create views in the same
       database as the source collection.
       
       

   * - ``pipeline``

     - array

     - An array that consists of the :ref:`aggregation pipeline stage(s)
       <aggregation-pipeline>`.  :method:`db.createView` creates the view by
       applying the specified ``pipeline`` to the ``source`` collection or view.
       
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-restriction-output-to-disk.rst
               
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-public-definition.rst
       
       

   * - ``options``

     - document

     - Optional. Additional options for the method.
          
          
   


The options document contains the following option field:


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Field

     - Type

     - Description

   * - ``collation``

     - document

     - Optional. Specifies the default :ref:`collation <collation>` for the view.
       
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-description.rst
       
       If the underlying ``source`` is a collection, the view does not
       inherit the collection's collation settings. 
       
       If no collation is specified, the view's default collation is the
       "simple" binary comparison collator.
       
       If the underlying ``source`` is another view, the view must specify
       the same collation settings.
       
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-option-specification.rst
       
       .. versionadded:: 3.4
          
          
   


The :method:`db.createView()` method wraps the following
:dbcommand:`create` command operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { create: <view>, viewOn: <source>, pipeline: <pipeline>, collation: <collation> } )

Operations that lists collections, such as
:method:`db.getCollectionInfos()` and
:method:`db.getCollectionNames()`, includes views in their outputs.

.. important::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-public-definition.rst

To remove a view, use the :method:`~db.collection.drop()` method on the
view.

Examples
--------

Create a View from a Single Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given a collection ``survey`` with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: 1, empNumber: "abc123", feedback: { management: 3, environment: 3 }, department: "A" }
   { _id: 2, empNumber: "xyz987", feedback: { management: 2, environment: 3 }, department: "B" }
   { _id: 3, empNumber: "ijk555", feedback: { management: 3, environment: 4 }, department: "A" }

The following operation creates a ``managementFeedback`` view with
the ``_id``, ``feedback.management``, and ``department`` fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createView(
      "managementFeedback",
      "survey",
      [ { $project: { "management": "$feedback.management", department: 1 } } ]
   )

Query a View
````````````

To query the view, you can use :method:`db.collection.find()` on
the view:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.managementFeedback.find()

The operation returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "department" : "A", "management" : 3 }
   { "_id" : 2, "department" : "B", "management" : 2 }
   { "_id" : 3, "department" : "A", "management" : 3 }

Perform Aggregation Pipeline on a View
``````````````````````````````````````

The following operation performs an aggregation on the
``managementFeedback`` view, using the :pipeline:`$sortByCount` to
group by the ``department`` field and sort in descending order by the
count of each distinct department:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.managementFeedback.aggregate([ { $sortByCount: "$department" } ] )

The operation returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : "A", "count" : 2 }
   { "_id" : "B", "count" : 1 }

Create a View from Multiple Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given the following two collections:

- The ``orders`` collection:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { "_id" : 1, "item" : "abc", "price" : NumberDecimal("12.00"), "quantity" : 2 }
     { "_id" : 2, "item" : "jkl", "price" : NumberDecimal("20.00"), "quantity" : 1 }
     { "_id" : 3, "item" : "abc", "price" : NumberDecimal("10.95"), "quantity" : 5 }
     { "_id" : 4, "item" : "xyz", "price" : NumberDecimal("5.95"), "quantity" : 5 }
     { "_id" : 5, "item" : "xyz", "price" : NumberDecimal("5.95"), "quantity" : 10 }

- The ``inventory`` collection:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { "_id" : 1, "sku" : "abc", description: "product 1", "instock" : 120 }
     { "_id" : 2, "sku" : "def", description: "product 2", "instock" : 80 }
     { "_id" : 3, "sku" : "ijk", description: "product 3", "instock" : 60 }
     { "_id" : 4, "sku" : "jkl", description: "product 4", "instock" : 70 }
     { "_id" : 5, "sku" : "xyz", description: "product 5", "instock" : 200 }

The following :method:`db.createView()` example specifies a
:pipeline:`$lookup` stage to create a view from the join of the two
collections:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createView (
      "orderDetails",
      "orders",
      [
        { $lookup: { from: "inventory", localField: "item", foreignField: "sku", as: "inventory_docs" } },
        { $project: { "inventory_docs._id": 0, "inventory_docs.sku": 0 } }
      ]
   )

Query a View
````````````

To query the view, you can use :method:`db.collection.find()` on
the view:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orderDetails.find()

The operation returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : 1,
      "item" : "abc",
      "price" : NumberDecimal("12.00"),
      "quantity" : 2,
      "inventory_docs" : [ { "description" : "product 1", "instock" : 120 } ]
   }
   {
      "_id" : 2,
      "item" : "jkl",
      "price" : NumberDecimal("20.00"),
      "quantity" : 1,
      "inventory_docs" : [ { "description" : "product 4", "instock" : 70 } ]
   }
   {
      "_id" : 3,
      "item" : "abc",
      "price" : NumberDecimal("10.95"),
      "quantity" : 5,
      "inventory_docs" : [ { "description" : "product 1", "instock" : 120 } ]
   }
   {
      "_id" : 4,
      "item" : "xyz",
      "price" : NumberDecimal("5.95"),
      "quantity" : 5,
      "inventory_docs" : [ { "description" : "product 5", "instock" : 200 } ]
   }
   {
      "_id" : 5,
      "item" : "xyz",
      "price" : NumberDecimal("5.95"),
      "quantity" : 10,
      "inventory_docs" : [ { "description" : "product 5", "instock" : 200 } ]
   }

Perform Aggregation Pipeline on a View
``````````````````````````````````````

The following operation performs an aggregation on the ``orderDetails``
view, using the :pipeline:`$sortByCount` to group by the ``item``
field and sort in descending order by the count of each distinct item:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orderDetails.aggregate( [ { $sortByCount: "$item" } ] )

The operation returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : "xyz", "count" : 2 }
   { "_id" : "abc", "count" : 2 }
   { "_id" : "jkl", "count" : 1 }

.. _create-view-w-collation:

Create a View with Default Collation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given the ``places`` collection with the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: 1, category: "café" }
   { _id: 2, category: "cafe" }
   { _id: 3, category: "cafE" }

The following operation creates a view, specifying :ref:`collation
<collation>` at the view level:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createView(
      "placesView", 
      "places",
      [ { $project: { category: 1 } } ],
      { collation: { locale: "fr", strength: 1 } } 
   )

String comparisons on the view use the view's default collation. For
example, the following operation uses the view's collation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.placesView.count( { category: "cafe" } )

The operation returns ``3``.

An operation that attempts to change or override a view's default
collation will fail with an error.
