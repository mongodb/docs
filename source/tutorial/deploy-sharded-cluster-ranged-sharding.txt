Overview
--------

In ranged-based sharding, MongoDB automatically divides data into contiguous
ranges determined by the shard key values. In this model, documents with
"close" shard key values are likely to be in the same :term:`chunk` or
:term:`shard`. This allows for efficient queries where reads target documents
within a contiguous range. However, both read and write performance may
decrease with poor shard key selection. See :ref:`sharding-ranged-shard-key`.

If you already have a sharded cluster deployed, skip to 
:ref:`deploy-ranged-sharded-cluster-shard-collection`.

CloudManager and OpsManager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are currently using or are planning to use Cloud Manager or
Ops Manager, consider using their built-in features for
deploying a :term:`sharded cluster`.

See ``Deploy a Sharded Cluster`` in the
:mms-docs:`Cloud Manager manual</tutorial/deploy-sharded-cluster>` or in the
:opsmgr:`Ops Manager manual</tutorial/deploy-sharded-cluster>`.

Considerations
--------------

Operating System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial uses the :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`
programs. Windows users should use the :program:`mongod.exe` and
:program:`mongos.exe` programs instead.

Security
~~~~~~~~

This tutorial does *not* include the required steps for configuring
:doc:`/core/security-internal-authentication` or :doc:`/core/authorization`.
See :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-sharded-cluster-with-keyfile-access-control` for a
tutorial on deploying a sharded cluster with a
:ref:`keyfile<internal-auth-keyfile>`.

In production environments, sharded clusters should employ at
minimum :doc:`/core/security-x.509` security for internal authentication
and client access.

For details on using x.509 for internal authentication, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-member-authentication`.

For details on using x.509 for client authentication, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication`.

.. note::

   Enabling internal authentication also enables
   :doc:`/core/authorization`.

Deploy Sharded Cluster with Ranged Sharding
-------------------------------------------

The following procedures involve creating a new sharded cluster that consists
of a :program:`mongos`, the config servers, and two shards.

.. _deploy-ranged-sharded-cluster-config-server:

Create the Config Server Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps deploys a config server replica set.

For a production deployment, deploys a config server replica set with at
least three members. For testing purposes, you can create a
single-member replica set.

.. include:: /includes/steps/deploy-sharded-cluster-config-server-noauth.rst

Once the config server replica set (CSRS) is initiated and up, proceed
to creating the shard replica sets.

Create the Shard Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a production deployment, use a replica set with at least three
members. For testing purposes, you can create a single-member replica
set.

.. include:: /includes/steps/deploy-sharded-cluster-shard-replica-noauth.rst

Connect a ``mongos`` to the Sharded Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/deploy-sharded-cluster-connect-noauth.rst

Add Shards to the Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the :method:`sh.addShard()` method to add each shard to the cluster. If
the shard is a replica set, specify the name of the replica set and specify a
member of the set. In production deployments, *all* shards should be replica
sets.

The following operation adds a single shard replica set to the cluster:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.addShard( "<replSetName>/s1-mongo1.example.net:27017")

The following operation is an example of adding a standalone :program:`mongod`
shard to the cluster:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.addShard( "s1-mongo1.example.net:27017")

Repeat these steps until the cluster includes all shards.

.. _deploy-ranged-sharded-cluster-shard-database:

Enable Sharding for a Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To proceed, you must be connected to a :program:`mongos` associated to the
target sharded cluster.

Enabling sharding on a database makes it possible to shard collections
within a database. Use the :method:`sh.enableSharding()` method to
enable sharding on the target database.

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.enableSharding("<database>")

.. _deploy-ranged-sharded-cluster-shard-collection:

Shard a Collection using Ranged Sharding
----------------------------------------

To proceed, you must be connected to a :program:`mongos` associated to the
target sharded cluster.

To shard a collection, use the :method:`sh.shardCollection()` method. You must
specify the full namespace of the collection and a document containing the
shard key. The database must have sharding
:ref:`enabled<deploy-ranged-sharded-cluster-shard-database>`.

Your selection of shard key affects the efficiency of sharding, as well as
your ability to take advantage of certain sharding features such as
:ref:`zones <zone-sharding>`. See the selection considerations listed
in the :ref:`sharding-ranged-shard-key`.

If the collection already contains data, you must create an index on the
:term:`shard key` using the :method:`db.collection.createIndex()` method before
using :method:`~sh.shardCollection()`.

If the collection is empty, MongoDB creates the index as part of
:method:`sh.shardCollection()`.

The following operation shards the target collection using the
:doc:`ranged</core/ranged-sharding>` sharding strategy.

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.shardCollection("<database>.<collection>", { <key> : <direction> } )
