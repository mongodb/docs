.. note::

   If you have multiple |onprem| hosts using a single Application
   Database, you are running your |onprem| deployment with high
   availability. After you upgrade one |onprem| host of a highly
   available |onprem| deployment, that deployment enters **Upgrade
   Mode**. You should not upgrade more than one |onprem| host at a
   time.
