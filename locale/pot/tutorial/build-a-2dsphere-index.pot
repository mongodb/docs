A ``2dsphere`` index can be a :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` and does not require the location field to be the first field indexed."

msgid "The first example creates a simple geospatial index on the location field ``loc``. The second example creates a compound index where the second field contains non-location data. The third example creates an index where the location field is not the primary field: the location field does not have to be the first field in a ``2dsphere`` index. The fourth example creates a compound index with three fields. You can include as many fields as you like in a ``2dsphere`` index."
