  This query uses the following pipeline stages: 
  
  .. list-table:: 
     :stub-columns: 1

     * - :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` 
       - - Prefilters the documents to search for movies in the
           ``Action`` genre, and not in the ``Western`` genre.
         - Searches the ``plot_embedding`` field for exact nearest
           neighbors by using vector embeddings for the string
           ``thrilling heist with twists``. 
         - Limits the output to only 10 results.

     * - :pipeline:`$project` 
       - - Excludes all fields except ``plot``, ``title``, and
           ``genres`` from the documents in the results.  
         - Adds a field named ``score`` that shows the score of the
           documents the results.

  The top nine documents in the example |enn| and |ann| query results
  are the same and have the same score. This shows a high-level of
  similarity in the top results for the query. However, the tenth
  document in the |enn| and |ann| query results is different, which
  reflects a slight variation in the exact and approximate nearest
  neighbor search.  

  |enn| search examines all possible candidates and returns the
  closest match to the query based on the similarity score. |ann| search
  uses approximations to speed up the search, which might alter the
  score of the documents. If you increase the ``numCandidates`` value in
  the |ann| query, the results will be a closer match to the |enn|
  query results. However, this would consume additional computational
  resources and might reduce query speed. The tenth document in the
  results reflects the trade-off between accuracy and speed. 
  
  After quantitatively evaluating results against the |enn| ground
  truth, we recommend testing a set of 100 queries in the same manner
  and computing the "jaccard similarity" between the result sets.
  Jaccard similarity can be computed by dividing the intersection
  between two sets, that is, the overlapping items, by the total set
  size. This gives a sense for recall performance of |ann| queries,
  including those performed against quantized vectors. 
  
  If you notice large discrepancies between your |enn| and |ann| query
  results, we recommend tuning the ``numCandidates`` value to strike an 
  ideal balance between accuracy and speed for your application.
