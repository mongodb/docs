Finalize Cutover Process

You can finalize a migration and transfer your application
workload from the source to the destination cluster using the
:ref:`mongosync <c2c-mongosync>` cutover process.

``mongosync`` should remain active until it reaches the
:ref:`COMMITTED <c2c-state-committed>` state. This allows ``mongosync`` to sync
any additional writes that occur during the migration.

.. note::

   Before you switch your application workload to the
   destination cluster, you should always verify a successful sync.
   For more information, see :ref:`c2c-verification`.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Verify the status of mongosync.

      Call the :ref:`progress <c2c-api-progress>` endpoint to determine
      the status of ``mongosync`` before starting the cutover process.
      Ensure that the ``mongosync`` process status indicates the
      following values:

      - ``canCommit`` is ``true``.

      - ``lagTimeSeconds`` is small (near ``0``).

        If ``lagTimeSeconds`` isn't close to ``0`` when the cutover
        starts, cutover might take a long time.

      The following example returns the status of the
      synchronization process.

      Request
      ~~~~~~~

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/api/requests/progress.sh
         :language: shell

      Response
      ~~~~~~~~

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/api/responses/progress.json
         :language: json
         :copyable: false
         :emphasize-lines: 5, 8

   .. step:: Stop any write operations to the synced collections on the source.

      - Wait for all transactions on the source cluster to either commit or 
        abort.
      - If you start ``mongosync`` with ``enableUserWriteBlocking``
        set to ``true``, ``mongosync`` blocks all write operations on
        the entire source cluster during the commit (step 4) for you.
      - If you didn't start ``mongosync`` with
        ``enableUserWriteBlocking``, ensure that you disable writes.
        For example, run the :dbcommand:`setUserWriteBlockMode` command on the
        source cluster:

        .. code-block:: javascript

           db.adminCommand( {
               setUserWriteBlockMode: 1,
               global: true 
           } )

      - If ``mongosync`` uses filtered sync, it's not necessary to
        disable writes to the entire source cluster. However, you must ensure
        that you stop write operations for the collections that the
        filter includes.

   .. step:: Send a :ref:`commit <c2c-api-commit>` request to ``mongosync``.

      If you start multiple ``mongosync`` instances for your
      migration, you must issue a commit request for each ``mongosync``
      instance.

      Request
      ~~~~~~~~

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/api/requests/commit.sh
         :language: shell

      Response
      ~~~~~~~~

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/api/responses/success.json
         :language: json
         :copyable: false

      .. note::

         After you submit a ``commit`` request, call the ``progress`` endpoint
         to ensure that the ``mongosync`` state is ``COMMITTING`` or
         ``COMMITTED``.

      Once you complete this step, ``mongosync`` blocks writes on the source
      cluster.
      
      If your source cluster contains Persistant Query Settings (PQS), you must
      :ref:`manually migrate PQS <c2c-migrate-pqs>` to your destination cluster.

      If you previously set ``enableUserWriteBlocking``
      to ``true``, ``mongosync`` blocks writes on the source cluster
      once you complete this step.

   .. step:: Wait until you can perform writes on the destination cluster.

      Call the ``progress`` endpoint to determine if ``canWrite`` is
      ``true``. If ``canWrite`` is ``false``, wait until ``progress``
      shows ``canWrite`` is ``true``.

      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: true

         .. input::
            :language: bash

            curl -sS localhost:27182/api/v1/progress -XGET | jq ".progress.canWrite"

         .. output::
            :language: json

            true

   .. step:: Verify data transfer.

      Verify the successful sync of data from the source to the
      destination cluster.

      For more information, see :ref:`c2c-verification`.

   .. step:: If you manually blocked writes on the destination cluster by using :dbcommand:`setUserWriteBlockMode`, enable application writes on the destination cluster.

      To enable writes, update :dbcommand:`setUserWriteBlockMode`:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.adminCommand(
            {
               setUserWriteBlockMode: 1,
               global: false
            }
         )

      Then, transfer your application workload to the destination cluster.

      If you started ``mongosync``
      with write-blocking by using the ``enableUserWriteBlocking`` option on
      the :ref:`/start <c2c-api-start>` endpoint, you do not need
      to complete this step.

   .. step:: Call the ``progress`` endpoint to determine the status of the ``mongosync`` process.

      When the ``mongosync`` progress response indicates that the
      ``mongosync`` state is ``COMMITTED``, the cutover process is
      complete.

      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: true

         .. input::
            :language: bash

            curl -sS localhost:27182/api/v1/progress -XGET | jq ".progress.state"

         .. output::
            :language: json

            "COMMITTED"
   
Behavior
--------

.. _c2c-canWrite-committed:

canWrite and COMMITTED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``mongosync`` permits writes on the destination cluster at an
earlier stage than the ``COMMITTED`` state.

In the initial sync, ``mongosync`` replicates unique indexes on
the source cluster as non-unique indexes on the destination
cluster. During commit, the relevant non-unique indexes on the
destination cluster are set to ``prepareUnique``. When this is
done, the ``/progress`` endpoint begins to return ``canWrite:
true``. Collections with ``prepareUnique`` indexes reject
new documents that violate the unique index constraint.
``mongosync`` then converts the ``prepareUnique``
indexes into unique indexes. When this is done, ``mongosync``
changes its state to ``COMMITTED``.

.. note::

   The conversion of ``prepareUnique`` indexes to unique
   indexes can be resource intensive when syncing large
   collections. This can result in a long time between the
   ``/progress`` endpoint returning ``canWrite: true`` and
   ``mongosync`` reaching the ``COMMITTED`` state.
