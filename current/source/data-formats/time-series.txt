Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to store
and interact with **time series data**.

Time series data is composed of the following components:

- Measured quantity
- Timestamp for the measurement
- Metadata that describes the measurement

The following table describes sample situations for which you could store time
series data:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33, 33, 33
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Situation
     - Measured Quantity
     - Metadata

   * - Recording monthly sales by industry
     - Revenue in USD
     - Company, country

   * - Tracking weather changes
     - Precipitation level
     - Location, sensor type

   * - Recording fluctuations in housing prices
     - Monthly rent price
     - Location, currency

.. _kotlin-sync-time-series-create:

Create a Time Series Collection
-------------------------------

.. important:: Server Version for Time Series Collections

   To create and interact with time series collections, you must be
   connected to a deployment running {+mdb-server+} 5.0 or later.

You can create a time series collection to store time series data.  
To create a time series collection, pass the following parameters to the 
``createCollection()`` method:

- The name of the new collection to create

- A `CreateCollectionOptions <{+core-api+}/client/model/CreateCollectionOptions.html>`__
  object with the `TimeSeriesOptions <{+core-api+}/client/model/TimeSeriesOptions.html>`__ set
  using the ``timeSeriesOptions()`` method

.. _kotlin-sync-time-series-create-example:

Example
~~~~~~~

This example creates the ``october2024`` time series collection in the
``fall_weather`` database with the ``timeField`` option set to the ``"timestamp"`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-formats/time-series.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :start-after: start-create-time-series
   :end-before: end-create-time-series
   :dedent:

To verify that you successfully created the time series collection, run
the ``listCollections()`` method on the database and print the results:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/data-formats/time-series.kt
      :language: kotlin
      :start-after: start-print-time-series
      :end-before: end-print-time-series
      :dedent:

   .. output::

      {
        "name": "october2024",
        "type": "timeseries",
        "options": {
          "timeseries": {
            "timeField": "temperature",
            "granularity": "seconds",
            "bucketMaxSpanSeconds": 3600
          }
        },
        "info": {
          "readOnly": false
        }
     }
     ...

.. _kotlin-sync-time-series-store:

Store Time Series Data
----------------------

You can insert data into a time series collection by using the ``insertOne()``
or ``insertMany()`` methods and specifying the measurement, timestamp, and metadata
in each inserted document.

.. tip::

  To learn more about inserting documents into a collection, see the :ref:`kotlin-sync-write-insert`
  guide.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example inserts New York City temperature data into the ``october2024``
time series collection created in the :ref:`Create a Time Series Collection example
<kotlin-sync-time-series-create-example>`. Each document contains the following fields:

- ``temperature``, which stores temperature measurements in degrees Fahrenheit
- ``location``, which stores location metadata
- ``timestamp``, which stores the time of the measurement collection

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-formats/time-series.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :start-after: start-insert-time-series-data
   :end-before: end-insert-time-series-data
   :dedent:

.. _kotlin-sync-time-series-query:

Query Time Series Data
----------------------

You can use the same syntax and conventions to query data stored in a time 
series collection as you use when performing read or aggregation operations on
other collections. To learn more about these operations, see
the :ref:`Additional Information <kotlin-sync-time-series-addtl-info>` section.

.. _kotlin-sync-time-series-addtl-info:

Additional Information
----------------------

To learn more about the concepts mentioned in this guide, see the
following {+mdb-server+} manual entries:

- :manual:`Time Series </core/timeseries-collections/>`
- :manual:`Create and Query a Time Series Collection </core/timeseries/timeseries-procedures/>`
- :manual:`Set Granularity for Time Series Data </core/timeseries/timeseries-granularity/>`

To learn more about performing read operations, see :ref:`kotlin-sync-read`.

To learn more about performing aggregation operations, see the :ref:`kotlin-sync-aggregation`
guide.
