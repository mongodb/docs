The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is a set of regulations 
that the European Union (EU) adopted to help ensure the digital 
operational resilience of financial institutions and service providers.

DORA applies to a wide range of regulated financial services providers 
within the EU, such as banks, credit institutions, payment 
institutions, investment firms, and asset management companies. It also 
covers entities like crypto-asset services providers, trading venues, 
and credit rating agencies.

The key requirements for DORA fall under five pillars: 
information and communication technology (ICT) risk management, 
ICT-related incident reporting, digital operational resilience testing, 
ICT third-party risk management, and information sharing.

To learn more about how MongoDB can support you with DORA compliance, 
see the `EU Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) 
<https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/trust/dora>`__ page in the 
MongoDB Trust Center.

Pillar 1: ICT Risk Management
-----------------------------

DORA requires regulated companies to establish a framework 
to identify, assess, and mitigate ICT risks. This framework includes 
conducting regular risk assessments, implementing controls to address 
identified risks, and having a plan for incident response.

The following |service-fullname| features support compliance in this 
area.

- :ref:`High availability <arch-center-high-availability>` including 
  database replication and automatic failover.
- :ref:`Backups <arch-center-backups>` including cloud backups, 
  continuous cloud backups, multi-region snapshot distribution, and a 
  backup compliance policy.
- :ref:`Disaster recovery <arch-center-dr>` including recovery point 
  objectives, and recovery time objectives.
- :ref:`Features to support compliance with external standards 
  <arch-center-compliance>` including ISO/IEC 27001, SOC2 Type II, and 
  PCI DSS.
- :ref:`Network security <arch-center-network-security>` including  TLS/
  SSL encryption, IP access lists, firewall configuration, and private 
  endpoints.
- :ref:`Authentication <arch-center-authentication-recs>` including UI, 
  database, API, federated, AWS IAM role, multi-factor, and SCRAM 
  password authentication. This feature and guidance also includes 
  X.509 certificates, API keys, and secrets management.
- :ref:`Authorization <arch-center-authorization-recs>` including Role 
  Based Access Control (RBAC), pre-defined roles, federated identity 
  providers, and just-in-time access.
- :ref:`Auditing <arch-center-auditing>` including database auditing, 
  creating and enabling audit filters, and recommended audit events.
- :ref:`Logging <arch-center-logging>` including accessing audit logs 
  manually and programmatically.
- :ref:`Data encryption <arch-center-data-encryption>` including 
  encryption in transit (TLS), at rest (AES-256, BYOK, CMK, KMS, or 
  TDE), and in use (CSFLE, random, and queryable encryption).

Pillar 2: ICT-Related Incident Management
-----------------------------------------

DORA requires regulated companies to have processes in place to detect, 
report, and investigate ICT-related incidents. These processes include 
having clear reporting channels, procedures for classifying incidents 
based on severity, and timely notification to relevant authorities.

|service-fullname| supports the following aspects of this pillar:

- :ref:`Authentication <arch-center-authentication-recs>`.
- Data localization.
- :ref:`Encryption in transit or volume <arch-center-data-encryption>`.
- :ref:`Network isolation <arch-center-hierarchy>`.
- :ref:`Granular auditing <arch-center-auditing>`.
- :ref:`Data backup <arch-center-backups>`.
- Platform security.
- :ref:`High availability <arch-center-high-availability>`.
- :ref:`Autoscaling <arch-center-scalability>`. 
- Distributed architecture.

Your chosen cloud provider(s) supports the following aspect of this 
pillar:

- Physical security.

Pillar 3: Digital Operational Resilience Testing
------------------------------------------------

DORA requires regulated companies to conduct regular testing of their 
ICT systems and resilience measures.

The following |service-fullname| features support 
compliance in this area:

- :ref:`Regional outage simulation <test-outage-process>`.
- :atlas:`Primary failover test 
  </tutorial/test-resilience/test-primary-failover/>`.

Pillar 4: ICT Third-Party Risk Management
-----------------------------------------

DORA-regulated companies need to conduct due diligence on third 
parties, have contractual agreements outlining security expectations, 
and monitor their performance.

The following |service-fullname| features support 
compliance in this area:

- Sync data across cluster environments:
 
  - `Connect a Self-Managed Cluster to Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongosync/current/connecting/onprem-to-atlas/>`__.

  - `Connect Two Atlas Clusters <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongosync/current/connecting/atlas-to-atlas/>`__.
   
  - `Connect Two Self-Managed Clusters <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongosync/current/connecting/onprem-to-onprem/>`__.
  
- :ref:`Multi-cloud deployment paradigm 
  <arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud>`.

- |mongosync| (cluster-to-cluster sync).

- `MongoDB Cloud Status <https://status.mongodb.com/>`__ page.

Pillar 5: Information Sharing
-----------------------------

DORA encourages collaboration and information sharing on cyber threats 
among regulated companies. This can involve participating in 
industry forums, sharing threat intelligence, and conducting joint 
exercises.

The following |service-fullname| features support compliance 
in this area:

- :ref:`Audit logging <arch-center-logging>`.
- :atlas:`Third-party integrations 
  </tutorial/third-party-service-integrations/>`.
- :ref:`Monitoring and alerts <arch-center-monitoring-alerts>`.
- :ref:`Encryption and key management <arch-center-data-encryption>`. 
- :ref:`Private networking <arch-center-network-security>`.
- :ref:`Backup recovery <arch-center-backups>`.
