# Atlas CLI Commands TOC Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the `content/tools/atlas-cli-commands-toc` tooling to automatically filter out deprecated serverless commands and clean serverless references from documentation files.

## Enhancements Made

### 1. File Filtering (`getFilesRecursively` function)
- **Added**: Automatic filtering of files containing "serverless" or "Serverless" in filename
- **Logs**: Shows which serverless files are being filtered out
- **Result**: Prevents serverless command files from being processed and included in TOC

### 2. Content Cleaning (`cleanServerlessReferences` function) 
**New function that removes:**

#### Toctree Entries
- Lines matching pattern: `^\s+\w*[Ss]erverless\w*\s+</command/.*>\s*$`
- Examples removed:
  - `createServerlessBackupRestoreJob </command/atlas-api-cloudBackups-createServerlessBackupRestoreJob>`
  - `getServerlessAutoIndexing </command/atlas-api-performanceAdvisor-getServerlessAutoIndexing>`
  - `listServerlessBackups </command/atlas-api-cloudBackups-listServerlessBackups>`

#### Reference Links  
- Lines matching pattern: `^\s*\*\s+:ref:`[^`]*[Ss]erverless[^`]*`[^\n]*$`
- Examples removed:
  - `* :ref:`atlas-api-cloudBackups-createServerlessBackupRestoreJob` - Restores one snapshot...`
  - `* :ref:`atlas-api-performanceAdvisor-getServerlessAutoIndexing` - Get whether the Serverless...`

### 3. Enhanced Copy Process
- **Modified**: `copyCommandFilesFromGit` function to clean content during copying
- **Added**: Progress logging showing how many files had serverless content cleaned
- **Result**: All copied files are automatically cleaned of serverless references

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- **Created**: `test-serverless-filtering.ts` - Standalone test script
- **Tests**: Verifies toctree cleaning, reference link cleaning, and content preservation
- **Usage**: `npx tsx test-serverless-filtering.ts`

### 5. Documentation Updates
- **Updated**: README.md with new "Serverless Command Filtering" section
- **Added**: Examples of what gets filtered and cleaned
- **Added**: Testing instructions

## Files Modified

1. **`generate-cli-commands.ts`**
   - Enhanced `getFilesRecursively()` with serverless filtering
   - Added `cleanServerlessReferences()` function
   - Modified file copying to include content cleaning
   - Added progress logging for serverless cleanup

2. **`README.md`**
   - Added serverless filtering to features list
   - Added detailed serverless filtering documentation
   - Added testing instructions

3. **`test-serverless-filtering.ts`** (new)
   - Standalone test script for the filtering functionality
   - Comprehensive test cases with example content

## Test Results
✅ **All tests passed:**
- Serverless toctree entries removed: ✅
- Serverless reference links removed: ✅ 
- Non-serverless content preserved: ✅

## Benefits

1. **Automated Cleanup**: No manual intervention needed to remove serverless references
2. **Future-Proof**: Will automatically handle any new serverless commands that may appear
3. **Comprehensive**: Removes both navigation entries (toctree) and descriptive links (refs)
4. **Safe**: Preserves all non-serverless content
5. **Logged**: Provides clear feedback on what was cleaned

## Usage
The enhancements are now integrated into the main generation workflow. When running:

```bash
npx tsx generate-cli-commands.ts atlascli/v1.46.2
```

The tool will now automatically:
1. Filter out serverless command files during collection
2. Clean serverless references from remaining files during copying
3. Log all filtering and cleaning actions
4. Generate a clean TOC without any serverless command references

This ensures that future TOC generations will be free of deprecated serverless command references without requiring manual cleanup.
