Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to use the {+driver-short+} to perform a bulk
write operation that makes multiple changes to your data in a single
database call.

Consider a scenario in which you want to insert a document,
update multiple other documents, then delete a document. If you use
individual methods, each operation requires its own database call.

By using a bulk write operation, you can perform multiple write operations in
fewer database calls. You can perform bulk write operations at the following levels:

- :ref:`Collection <scala-coll-bulk-write>`: You can use the 
  ``MongoCollection.bulkWrite()`` method to perform bulk write operations on a 
  single collection. In this method, each kind of write operation requires at
  least one database call. For example, ``MongoCollection.bulkWrite()`` puts multiple update
  operations in one call, but makes two separate calls to the database for an insert
  operation and a replace operation.

- :ref:`Client <scala-client-bulk-write>`: If your application connects to
  {+mdb-server+} version 8.0 or later, you can use the ``MongoClient.bulkWrite()``
  method to perform bulk write operations on multiple collections and databases 
  in the same cluster. This method performs all write operations 
  in one database call.

.. _scala-coll-bulk-write:

Collection Bulk Write
---------------------

Bulk write operations contain one or more write operations. To perform a bulk 
write operation at the collection level, pass a ``Seq`` of ``WriteModel`` 
documents to the ``MongoCollection.bulkWrite()`` method. A ``WriteModel`` is a 
model that represents a write operation.

For each write operation that you want to perform, create an instance of
one of the following classes that inherit from ``WriteModel``:

- ``InsertOneModel``
- ``UpdateOneModel``
- ``UpdateManyModel``
- ``ReplaceOneModel``
- ``DeleteOneModel``
- ``DeleteManyModel``

Then, pass a list of these instances to the ``bulkWrite()`` method.

The following sections show how to create and use instances of the
preceding classes. The :ref:`scala-coll-bulkwrite-method` section
demonstrates how to pass a list of models to the ``bulkWrite()`` method
to perform the bulk operation.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this section use the ``restaurants`` collection in the ``sample_restaurants``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To access this collection
from your Scala application, create a ``MongoClient`` that connects to an Atlas cluster
and assign the following values to your ``database`` and ``collection`` variables:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.scala
   :language: scala
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-db-coll
   :end-before: end-db-coll

To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

Insert Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform an insert operation, create an ``InsertOneModel`` instance and specify
the document you want to insert.

The following example creates an instance of ``InsertOneModel``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.scala
   :start-after: start-bulk-insert-one
   :end-before: end-bulk-insert-one
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

To insert multiple documents, create an instance of ``InsertOneModel``
for each document.

.. important::

   When performing a bulk operation, the ``InsertOneModel`` cannot
   insert a document with an ``_id`` that already exists in the
   collection. In this situation, the driver throws a
   ``MongoBulkWriteException``.

Update Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update a document, create an instance of ``UpdateOneModel`` and pass
the following arguments:

- **Query filter** that specifies the criteria used to match documents in your collection.
- **Update operation** that you want to perform. To learn more about update
  operations, see the :manual:`Field Update Operators
  </reference/operator/update-field/>` guide in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

The following example creates an instance of ``UpdateOneModel``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.scala
   :start-after: start-bulk-update-one
   :end-before: end-bulk-update-one
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

If multiple documents match the query filter specified in
the ``UpdateOneModel`` instance, the operation updates the first
result. You can specify a sort in an ``UpdateOptions`` instance to apply
an order to matched documents before the driver performs the update
operation, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: scala

   val options = UpdateOptions.sort(ascending("name"))

To update *multiple* documents, create an instance of ``UpdateManyModel`` and pass
the same arguments as for ``UpdateOneModel``. The ``UpdateManyModel``
class specifies updates for *all* documents that match your query
filter.

The following example creates an instance of ``UpdateManyModel``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.scala
   :start-after: start-bulk-update-many
   :end-before: end-bulk-update-many
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

Replace Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A replace operation removes all fields and values of a specified document and
replaces them with new fields and values that you specify. To perform a
replace operation, create an instance of ``ReplaceOneModel`` and pass the following
arguments:

- Query filter that specifies the criteria used to match documents in your collection
- Replacement document that specifies the new fields and values to insert

The following example creates an instance of ``ReplaceOneModel``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.scala
   :start-after: start-bulk-replace-one
   :end-before: end-bulk-replace-one
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

If multiple documents match the query filter specified in
the ``ReplaceOneModel`` instance, the operation replaces the first
result. You can specify a sort in a ``ReplaceOptions`` instance to apply
an order to matched documents before the driver performs the replace
operation, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: scala

   val options = ReplaceOptions.sort(ascending("name"))

.. tip:: Replace Multiple Documents

   To replace multiple documents, create an instance of
   ``ReplaceOneModel`` for each document.

Delete Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete a document, create an instance of ``DeleteOneModel`` and pass a
query filter specifying the document you want to delete. A
``DeleteOneModel`` instance provides instructions to delete
only *the first* document that matches your query filter.

The following example creates an instance of ``DeleteOneModel``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.scala
   :start-after: start-bulk-delete-one
   :end-before: end-bulk-delete-one
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

To delete multiple documents, create an instance of ``DeleteManyModel`` and pass a
query filter specifying the document you want to delete. An instance of
``DeleteManyModel`` provides instructions to remove *all* documents that
match your query filter.

The following example creates an instance of ``DeleteManyModel``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.scala
   :start-after: start-bulk-delete-many
   :end-before: end-bulk-delete-many
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

.. _scala-coll-bulkwrite-method:

Perform the Bulk Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you define a model instance for each operation that you want to
perform, pass a ``Seq`` instance containing the models to the
``MongoCollection.bulkWrite()`` method. By default, the method runs the
operations in the order specified by the list of models.

The following example performs multiple write operations by using the
``bulkWrite()`` method:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/write/bulk-write.scala
      :start-after: start-bulk-write-mixed
      :end-before: end-bulk-write-mixed
      :language: scala
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :visible: false
      
      Success: AcknowledgedBulkWriteResult{insertedCount=1, matchedCount=1, removedCount=1,
      modifiedCount=1, upserts=[], inserts=[BulkWriteInsert{index=0, id=BsonObjectId{value=...}}]}
      Completed

If any of the write operations fail, the {+driver-short+} raises a
``BulkWriteError`` and does not perform any further operations.
``BulkWriteError`` provides a ``details`` item that includes the
operation that failed and details about the exception.

.. note::

   When the driver runs a bulk operation, it uses the write concern of the
   target collection. The driver reports all write concern errors after
   attempting all operations, regardless of execution order.

Customize Bulk Write
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``MongoCollection.bulkWrite()`` method optionally accepts a
``BulkWriteOptions`` parameter, which specifies options that you can use to
configure the bulk write operation. If you don't specify any options,
the driver performs the bulk operation with default settings. To modify
the behavior of the write operation, pass the class instance as the last
argument to the ``bulkWrite()`` method.

The following table describes the setter methods that you can use to
configure a ``BulkWriteOptions`` instance:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``ordered()``
     - | If ``true``, the driver performs the write operations in the order
         provided. If an error occurs, the remaining operations are not
         attempted. 
       |
       | If ``false``, the driver performs the operations in an
         arbitrary order and attempts to perform all operations.
       | Defaults to ``true``.

   * - ``bypassDocumentValidation()``
     - | Specifies whether the update operation bypasses document validation. This lets you 
         update documents that don't meet the schema validation requirements, if any 
         exist. For more information about schema validation, see :manual:`Schema
         Validation </core/schema-validation/#schema-validation>` in the MongoDB
         Server manual.
       | Defaults to ``false``.

   * - ``comment()``
     - | Sets a comment to attach to the operation.

   * - ``let()``
     - | Provides a map of parameter names and values to set top-level
         variables for the operation. Values must be constant or closed
         expressions that don't reference document fields.

The following code creates options and sets the ``ordered`` option to ``false`` to
specify an unordered bulk write. Then, the example uses the
``bulkWrite()`` method to perform a bulk operation:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.scala
   :start-after: start-bulk-write-unordered
   :end-before: end-bulk-write-unordered
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

If any of the write operations in an unordered bulk write fail, the {+driver-short+}
reports the errors only after attempting all operations.

.. note::

   Unordered bulk operations do not guarantee an order of execution. The
   order can differ from the way you list them to optimize the runtime.

Return Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``bulkWrite()`` method returns a ``SingleObservable`` object that contains a
``BulkWriteResult``. You can access information from the ``BulkWriteResult`` instance by 
subscribing to the observable and using the following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``wasAcknowledged()``
     - | Indicates if the server acknowledged the write operation.
         
   * - ``getDeletedCount()``
     - | The number of documents deleted, if any.

   * - ``getInsertedCount()``
     - | The number of documents inserted, if any.

   * - ``getInserts()``
     - | The list of inserted documents, if any.

   * - ``getMatchedCount()``
     - | The number of documents matched for an update, if applicable.

   * - ``getModifiedCount()``
     - | The number of documents modified, if any.

   * - ``getUpserts()``
     - | The list of upserted documents, if any.

Client Bulk Write
-----------------

When connecting to a deployment running {+mdb-server+} 8.0 or later,
you can use the ``MongoClient.bulkWrite()`` method to write
to multiple databases and collections in the same cluster. The
``MongoClient.bulkWrite()`` method performs all write operations in a
single call.

The ``MongoClient.bulkWrite()`` method takes a 
``List`` containing one or more ``ClientNamespacedWriteModel`` instances
to represent different write operations. You can construct instances of
the ``ClientNamespacedWriteModel`` interface by using instance methods.
For example, an instance of ``ClientNamespacedInsertOneModel`` represents an
operation to insert one document, and you can create this model by using
the ``ClientNamespacedWriteModel.insertOne()`` method.

The following table describes the models and their corresponding
instance methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 20 15 45
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Model
     - Instance Method
     - Description
     - Parameters

   *  - ``ClientNamespacedInsertOneModel``
      - ``insertOne()``

        ``document``: Document to insert

   * - ``ClientNamespacedUpdateOneModel``
     - ``updateOne()``
     - Creates a model to update the first document in the ``namespace``
       that matches ``filter``.
     - ``namespace``: Database and collection to write to

       ``filter``: Filter that selects which document to update

       ``update``: Update to apply to matching document

       ``updatePipeline``: Update pipeline to apply to matching document

       ``options``: *(optional)* Options to apply when updating document

       You must pass a value for either the ``update`` or ``updatePipeline`` 
       parameter.

   * - ``ClientNamespacedUpdateManyModel``
     - ``updateMany()``
     - Creates a model to update all documents in the ``namespace`` that match

The following sections provide some examples of how to create models and use
the client ``bulkWrite()``  method.

Insert Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to create models that contain instructions to
insert two documents. One document is inserted into the ``db.people``
collection, and the other document is inserted into the ``db.things`` collection.
The ``MongoNamespace`` instance defines the target database and collection that 
each write operation applies to.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/client-bulk-write.scala
   :start-after: start-insert-models
   :end-before: end-insert-models
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

.. _scala-client-bulk-write-update:

Update Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example shows how to use the ``bulkWrite()`` method to update
existing documents in the ``db.people`` and ``db.things`` collections:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/client-bulk-write.scala
   :language: scala
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-update-models
   :end-before: end-update-models

This example increments the value of the ``age`` field by ``1`` in the
document that has a ``name`` value of ``"Freya Polk"`` in the ``people``
collection. It also sets the value of the ``manufacturer`` field to
``"Premium Technologies"`` in all documents that have a ``category``
value of ``"electronic"`` in the ``things`` collection.

If multiple documents match the query filter specified in
a ``ClientNamespacedUpdateOneModel`` instance, the operation updates the
first result. You can specify a sort order in a `ClientUpdateOneOptions
<{+core-api+}/client/model/bulk/ClientUpdateOneOptions.html>`__
instance to apply an order to matched documents before the driver
performs the update operation, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: scala

   val options = ClientUpdateOneOptions
     .clientUpdateOneOptions()
     .sort(ascending("_id"))

.. _scala-client-bulk-write-replace:

Replace Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example shows how to create models to replace
existing documents in the ``db.people`` and ``db.things`` collections:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/client-bulk-write.scala
   :start-after: start-replace-models
   :end-before: end-replace-models
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

The preceding code example replaces the following documents with new
documents:

- Document in the ``people`` collection that has an ``_id`` value of ``1`` 
- Document in the ``things`` collection that has an ``_id`` value of ``1`` 

If multiple documents match the query filter specified in
a ``ClientNamespacedReplaceOneModel`` instance, the operation replaces the
first result. You can specify a sort order in a `ClientReplaceOneOptions
<{+core-api+}/client/model/bulk/ClientReplaceOneOptions.html>`__
instance to apply an order to matched documents before the driver
performs the replace operation, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: scala

   val options = ClientReplaceOneOptions
     .clientReplaceOneOptions()
     .sort(ascending("_id"))

Perform the Bulk Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you define a ``ClientNamespacedWriteModel`` instance for each
operation that you want to perform, pass a list of these instances to the
client ``bulkWrite()`` method. By default, the method runs the
operations in the order that you specify them.

The following example performs multiple write operations by using the
``bulkWrite()`` method:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: 

   .. input:: /includes/write/client-bulk-write.scala
      :start-after: start-perform
      :end-before: end-perform
      :language: scala
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      
      AcknowledgedSummaryClientBulkWriteResult{insertedCount=1, matchedCount=1, ...}

If any of the write operations fail, the driver raises a
``ClientBulkWriteException`` and does not perform any further individual operations.
``ClientBulkWriteException`` includes a ``BulkWriteError`` that can be accessed by using the
``ClientBulkWriteException.getWriteErrors()`` method, which provides
information about the failure.

.. _scala-client-bulk-write-options:

Customize Bulk Write
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can pass an instance of ``ClientBulkWriteOptions`` to the
``bulkWrite()`` method to customize how the driver performs the bulk write
operation.

Order of Execution
``````````````````

By default, the driver runs the individual operations in a bulk
operation in the order that you specify them. The driver runs the
operations until an error occurs, or until the total bulk operation
successfully completes.

However, you can pass ``false`` to the ``ordered()`` method when creating
a ``ClientBulkWriteOptions`` instance to direct the driver to perform
write operations in an unordered way. If you pass ``false``, the driver
attempts to run all write operations in the bulk write operation, even if one
operation produces an error.

The following code sets the ``ordered`` option to ``false`` in an
instance of ``ClientBulkWriteOptions`` and performs a bulk write operation to 
insert multiple documents:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/client-bulk-write.scala
   :start-after: start-options
   :end-before: end-options
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

Because the write operation is unordered, the driver performs all the
non-erroring operations even though the write operation that inserts a
document with a duplicate key results in an error.
