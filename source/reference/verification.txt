Before you switch your application load from the source cluster
to the destination cluster, you should verify that the migration
was successful.

Starting in 1.9, ``mongosync`` provides an embedded verifier
that can perform a series of verification checks on the source
and destination cluster to confirm the sync was successful.

Tasks
-----

You should verify your data after every sync. This is important
in cases where you plan to move your application load from the
source to the destination cluster.

   * - Verification Method
     - Description
   * - :ref:`Embedded Verifier <c2c-embedded-verifier>`
     - Starting in 1.9, ``mongosync`` includes an embedded
       verifier, which runs a series of verification checks on
       the source and destination clusters to confirm that the
       migration was successful. **This is the preferred
       verification method for deployments that meet the**
       :ref:`requirements <c2c-verify-embedded-limitations>`.

       When the ``mongosync`` process starts, it prompts the
       user with a disclaimer about the embedded verifier. You
       must accept the disclaimer, or if you have already read
       and acknowledged it, start ``mongosync`` with the
       :option:`--acceptDisclaimer` option to use the verifier.

       The verifier doesn't check every aspect of a migration:

       - To verify sync on unsupported namespaces, use a different 
         verification method.
       - To verify index sync, use the :ref:`Index Comparison
         <c2c-index-comparison>` method. 
       - To verify metdata sync, use the :ref:`Metadata
         Comparison <c2c-metadata-comparison>` method.

   * - :ref:`Document Counts <c2c-verify-doc-counts>`
     - The most basic method of verification is to compare the
       number of documents in each synced collection on the
       source cluster to the number on the destination cluster.
       
       Before you can verify data transfer with this method,
       ``mongosync`` must be in the ``COMMITTED`` state.

       This method only verifies a successful sync when run
       against clusters with insert-only workloads.

   * - :ref:`Hash Comparison <c2c-verify-hash-comp>`
     - You can verify sync by comparing MD5 hashes of
       collections synced from the source cluster to the
       destination cluster.

       Before you can verify data transfer with this method,
       ``mongosync`` must be in the ``COMMITTED`` state.

       While hash comparison ensures that the destination
       cluster has received all changes from the source, the
       :dbcommand:`dbHash` command locks the cluster, preventing
       additional writes until it completes.

       Hash comparison is **not** possible with sharded
       clusters. It also does not work with standalone servers
       and replica sets that use MongoDB 4.4 or earlier
       releases, since the document field order can vary.

   * - :ref:`Migration Verifier <c2c-migration-verifier>`
     - Migration Verifier connects to the source and destination
       clusters and performs a series of verification checks,
       comparing documents, views, and indexes to confirm the
       sync was successful.

   * - :ref:`Verifying Data with Custom Scripts <c2c-custom-manual-verification>`
     - Different types of data require different methods of verification. You can
       can use custom or manual verification to verify :ref:`documents <c2c-document-comparison>`,
       :ref:`indexes <c2c-index-comparison>`, :ref:`metadata <c2c-metadata-comparison>`,
       and :ref:`shard keys <c2c-shardkey-comparison>`. 

The specific method you use to verify your data depends on your
application workload and the complexity of the data.
