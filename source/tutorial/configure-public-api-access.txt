Configure Public API Access
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

To access the :doc:`Public API </api>` you generate an API key and
optionally configure access for whitelisted operations.

Public API Key
++++++++++++++

Your Public API key gives you access to the Public API. You have the same
level of access through the API as you do through the |mms| interface.
Your |mms| :doc:`roles </reference/user-roles>` determine which :doc:`API
resources </reference/api>` you can use.

You can have up to ten Public API keys associated with your account. Each
key can be either enabled or disabled but all count toward the ten-key
limit.

Whitelist
+++++++++

Certain API operations are protected by API whitelists. Only client
requests that originate from a whitelisted IP address are permitted to
perform the operations. To perform "whitelisted" operation, you must first
create the whitelist of addresses you will use when performing them. For a
given operation, you also must have a :doc:`role </reference/user-roles>`
that lets you perform the operation.

Procedures

.. _generate-public-api-key:

Generate Public API Keys
++++++++++++++++++++++++

When you generate a key, |mms| displays it **one time only**. You must
copy it. |mms| will never display the full key again.

A Public API key is like a password. Keep it secret.
