"As you develop and operate applications with MongoDB, you may need to "
"analyze the performance of the application and its database. When you "
"encounter degraded performance, it is often a function of database access"
" strategies, hardware availability, and the number of open database "
"connections."

"Some users may experience performance limitations as a result of "
"inadequate or inappropriate indexing strategies, or as a consequence of "

"Performance issues may indicate that the database is operating at "

msgid ""
"With the :ref:`MMAPv1 <storage-mmapv1>` storage engine, MongoDB uses "

msgid ""
"With the MMAPv1 storage engine, page faults can occur as MongoDB reads "
"from or writes data to parts of its data files that are not currently "

"happen when physical memory is exhausted and pages of physical memory are"
" swapped to disk."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../source/administration/analyzing-mongodb-performance.txt:115
msgid ""
"Rapid increases in the MongoDB page fault counter may indicate that the "

msgstr ""

#: ../source/administration/analyzing-mongodb-performance.txt:119
msgid ""
"A single page fault completes quickly and is not problematic. However, in"
" aggregate, large volumes of page faults typically indicate that MongoDB "
"is reading too much data from disk."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/administration/analyzing-mongodb-performance.txt:123
msgid ""
"MongoDB can often \"yield\" read locks after a page fault, allowing other"
" database processes to read while :binary:`~bin.mongod` loads the next "

"concurrency, and also improves overall throughput in high volume systems."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/administration/analyzing-mongodb-performance.txt:128

"Increasing the amount of RAM accessible to MongoDB may help reduce the "

"Spikes in the number of connections can also be the result of application"
" or driver errors. All of the officially supported MongoDB drivers "
"implement connection pooling, which allows clients to use and reuse "
