Each {+SPI+} stores every configured connection to a streaming data
source or sink in its connection registry. The procedures on this page
walk you through creating and configuring your {+atlas-sp+}
connections.

.. _atlas-sp-manage-spi-prereqs:

Prerequisites
-------------

To create and configure connections, you must have the following:

- An |service| :ref:`project <manage-projects>`
- An |service| user with the :authrole:`Project Owner` or
  the :authrole:`Project Stream Processing Owner` role to manage a
  connection registry

  .. note::
     
     The :authrole:`Project Owner` role allows you to create database 
     deployments, manage project access and project settings, manage 
     IP Access List entries, and more.

     The :authrole:`Project Stream Processing Owner` role enables {+atlas-sp+} 
     actions such as viewing, creating, deleting, and editing stream 
     processing instances, and viewing, adding, modifying, and deleting 
     connections in the connection registry. 

     See :ref:`Project Roles <project-roles>` to learn more about the 
     differences between the two roles.

- An |service| {+cluster+}

View Connections in the Connection Registry
-------------------------------------------

To view a connection to your {+spi+}:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: view-connection-cli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-streams-connections-list-and-describe.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: view-connection-ui

      .. include:: /includes/procedures/atlas-sp-view-connection-ui.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: view-connection-api

      The {+atlas-admin-api+} provides different endpoints for 
      retrieving one or all connections in a connection registry.

      :oas-atlas-tag:`View One Connection in a Connection Registry </Streams/operation/getStreanConnection>`
      
      :oas-atlas-tag:`List All Connections in a Connection Registry </Streams/operation/listStreamConnections>`

   .. tab:: ``mongosh``
      :tabid: view-connection-sh

      To list all available connections using ``mongosh``, use the
      ``sp.listConnections()`` method. It returns a list of documents
      describing each connection in the {+spi+}'s connection
      registry. It has the following syntax:

      .. code-block:: sh

         sp.listConnections()

.. _manage-spi-connection-add:
.. _atlas-sp-manage-connection-add:

Add a Connection to the Connection Registry
-------------------------------------------

{+atlas-sp+} supports the following connection types:

- :ref:`Apache Kafka brokers <atlas-sp-manage-kafka-add>`
- :ref:`{+service+} databases <atlas-sp-manage-atlas-add>`

Each type has distinct configuration requirements.

.. _atlas-sp-manage-kafka-add:

Add an Apache Kafka Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   VPC peering for {+atlas-sp+} is currently in
   private preview. To learn more, contact your
   account team.

To add a Kafka connection to your {+spi+}:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: add-connection-cli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-streams-connections-create.rst

      When you create a {+spi+} using the {+atlas-cli+}, you must provide a ``.json``
      configuration file to define the new connection's parameters. The format of this
      file depends on the type of connection you define.

      For an {+kafka+} connection, provide a configuration file with the following syntax:

      .. code-block:: json

         {
	   "name": "<name>",
	   "type": "Kafka",
	   "bootstrapServers": "<address:port>, ...",
	   "security": {
	     "protocol": "<protocol>"
	   },
	   "authentication": {
	     "mechanism": "<auth-mechanism>",
	     "username": "<username>",
	     "password": "<password>"
	   }
	 }

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: add-connection-ui

      .. include:: /includes/procedures/atlas-sp-add-kafka-connection-ui.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: add-connection-api

      The {+atlas-admin-api+} provides an endpoint for adding a 
      connection to a connection registry.

      :oas-atlas-tag:`Add a Connection to the Connection Registry </Streams/operation/createStreamConnection>`

.. important::

   After adding an external connection such as an {+kafka+} cluster to
   your connection registry, you must add {+service+} IP addresses to 
   an access list for that external connection. For more information, 
   see :ref:`atlas-add-inbound-ips`.

.. _atlas-sp-manage-atlas-add:

Add an {+service+} Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   VPC peering for {+atlas-sp+} is currently in
   private preview. To learn more, contact your
   account team.

To add an {+service+} database connection to your {+spi+}:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: add-connection-cli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-streams-connections-create.rst

      When you create a {+spi+} using the {+atlas-cli+}, you must provide a ``.json``
      configuration file to define the new connection's parameters. The format of this
      file depends on the type of connection you define.

      For an {+service+} database connection, provide a configuration
      file with the following syntax:

      .. code-block:: json

         {
	   "name": "<name>",
	   "type": "Cluster",
	   "clusterName": "<clusterName>"
	 }

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: add-connection-ui

      .. include:: /includes/procedures/atlas-sp-add-atlas-connection-ui.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: add-connection-api

      The {+atlas-admin-api+} provides an endpoint for adding a 
      connection to a connection registry.

      :oas-atlas-tag:`Add a Connection to the Connection Registry </Streams/operation/createStreamConnection>`

.. _manage-spi-connection-modify:
.. _atlas-sp-manage-connection-modify:

Modify a Connection from the Connection Registry
------------------------------------------------

To modify a connection from a connection registry:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: edit-connection-cli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-streams-connections-update.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}

      .. include:: /includes/procedures/atlas-sp-edit-connection-ui.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: edit-connection-api

      The {+atlas-admin-api+} provides an endpoint for editing a 
      {+spi+}.

      :oas-atlas-tag:`Delete One Stream Instance </Streams/operation/updateStreamConnection>`

.. _manage-spi-connection-delete:
.. _atlas-sp-manage-connection-delete:
