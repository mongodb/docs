While :ref:`objectid` values should increase over time, they are not
necessarily monotonic. This is because they:

* Only contain one second of temporal resolution, so :ref:`objectid`
  values created within the same second do not have a guaranteed
  ordering, and
* Are generated by clients, which may have differing system clocks.
