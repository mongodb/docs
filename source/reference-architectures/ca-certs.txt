This section provides guidance on the creation of TLS certificates for each 
component of MongoDB, and the creation of |k8s| Secrets in each of your |k8s| 
clusters to mount the TLS certificates securely into the appropriate |k8s| Pods. 

The process outlined below utilizes `Cert Manager <https://cert-manager.io/>`__ 
for creating the TLS certificates. However, please note that this is an 
opinionated guide, and CertManager is not supported by MongoDB. Moreover, CertManager 
is only one of many ways in which you can add TLS certificates to your |k8s| clusters.
Additionally, self-signed certificates may not be suitable for production deployments, 
depending on the security requirements of your organization. If you require 
publicly trusted certificates please configure your `Issuer <https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/issuers/>`__ accordingly 
or provide the TLS certificate directly. To learn more, see :ref:`<cert-manager-integration>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin, perform the following tasks:

- Install ``kubectl``.
- Install `Helm <https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/>`__.
- Set the ``K8S_CLUSTER_*_CONTEXT_NAME`` environment variables as 
  explained in the :ref:`GKE Clusters guide <reference-architectures-gke-clusters>`.

Source Code
-----------

You can find all included source code in the `MongoDB Kubernetes Operator repository <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes/tree/${current_branch}/architectures/setup-multi-cluster/setup-gke/setup-cert-manager>`__.
