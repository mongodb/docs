Overview
--------

MongoDB supports location-based queries and geospatial data with a
special index for coordinate data. The index stores :ref:`geohashes
<geospatial-geohash>` data, and makes it possible to return documents
using special proximity and bounded queries against flat or spherical
coordinate systems. Geospatial haystack indexes provide additional
support for certain classes of region-based queries.

This document provides an overview of the core concepts and designs
that underpin geospatial queries in MongoDB. For most cases, the
:doc:`/applications/geospatial-indexes` provide complete documentation
of all location-based operations and queries.

Geospatial Indexes
------------------

.. see:: :ref:`geospatial-coordinates` for an overview on modeling
   location data in MongoDB.

To use geospatial functions in MongoDB, you have to structure the
location data in a 2D array and make an index on this location
data with special options.

When you query for locations against the geospatial index, MongoDB
will automatically query against this geospatial index, as well as other
index configuration. This index is a :term:`geohash` calculated based on the
range and data points. For more information on :term:`geohash`, please
refer to :ref:`geohash<geospatial-geohash>`.

To create a geospatial index, use an operation modeled on the
following prototype:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { <location field> : "2d" } )

These operations will create a special index on location field in the
specified collection. All geospatial queries will use this geospatial
index.

.. note::

   MongoDB only supports *one* geospatial index per collection. As
   with all indexes in MongoDB, any single query will only be able to
   use one index. If a collection were to have more than one
   geospatial index, geospatial queries could not return consistent
   results.

.. _geospatial-indexes-range:

Range
~~~~~

All geospatial indexes are bounded. MongoDB will return an error and
reject documents with coordinate pairs outside of these
boundaries. The default boundaries support global coordinate data are
between -180 inclusive, and 180 non-inclusive (i.e. latitude and
longitude.)

To specify the boundaries of a geospatial index, use the ``min`` and
``max`` operators with the :func:`ensureIndex() <db.collection.ensureIndex()>`
operation, as in the following prototype.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { <location field>: "2d" } ,
                              { min: <lower bound> , max: <upper bound> } )

The following operation will create an index on the  ``places``
collection, for coordinates in the ``loc`` field, with boundaries
between ``-90`` and ``90``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.ensureIndex( { loc: "2d" } ,
                           { min: 90 , max: 90 } )

For more information see the :ref:`Geospatial Precision
<geospatial-indexes-precision>` and the :ref:`Geohashes
<geospatial-geohash>` section.

.. _geospatial-indexes-precision:

Precision
~~~~~~~~~

Geospatial indexes record precision, or resolution, in "bits", which
are configurable during index creation. If a geospatial index has a
higher bits setting, MongoDB will be able to return more precise
results from the index. However, lower resolution indexes provide
faster performance. For more information on the relationship between
bits and precision, see the :ref:`geohash <geospatial-geohash>` section.

By default, geospatial indexes in MongoDB have 26 bits of precision
and supports as many as 32 bits of precision. With 26 bits of
precision, using the default range of -180 to 180, your precision
would be about 1 foot or 30 centimeters. 

You can set the precision of a geospatial index during creation by
specifying the ``bits`` option to the :func:`ensureIndex()
<db.command.ensureIndex()>` method, as in the following example.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( {<location field>: "2d"} ,
                              { bits: <bit precision> } )

You may create an index with fewer than 26 bits *if* your the data in
your collection is less precise and/or you're willing to sacrifice
precision in exchange for query speed.

For more information on how to configure the range for your geospatial
data, please refer to the :ref:`range <geospatial-range>` section.

Compound Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports :ref:`compound indexes <index-type-compound>` where
one component holds coordinate data. For queries that include these
fields, MongoDB will use this index for a larger portion of these
operations, which will improve performance for these queries.

Use an operation that resembles the following prototype command to
create a compound geospatial index.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { <location field>: "2d", <field>: 1 } );

These compound indexes support queries where you must filter both by
location and by another field. For example, if you need to return a
list of restaurants near a given point, but you want to optionally
select only restaurants that match a certain type (i.e. "take-out," or
"bar" stored in a ``type`` field.)

.. note::

   Limits in geospatial queries are always applied to the geospatial
   component first. This will affect your result set if you specify
   additional sort operations.

.. seealso: ":ref:`<index-type-compound>`" and ":ref:`<geospatial-haystack-index>`"

.. _geospatial-haystack-index:

Haystack Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Geospatial haystack indexes makes it possible to build a special
``bucket`` index to tune for your distribution of data. Haystack
indexes improve query performance that operate within a limited
area. For more information, please refer to :doc:`Geospatial Indexes
</core/geospatial-indexes>`

To improve geospatial query performance with another field, please
refer to the :ref:`compound index <geospatial-compound-index>` section.

.. note::

   Haystack indexes are not suited to finding the closest documents to
   a particular location, as the closest documents could be far away
   compared to the bucket size.

To build a :term:`geoHaystack` index, specify the ``geoHaystack`` for the
location field and a ``bucketSize`` parameter . The ``bucketSize``
parameter determines the granularity of the bucket index. A
``bucketSize`` of 1 creates an index where keys within 1 unit of
longitude or latitude are stored in the same bucket.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex({ <location field>: "geoHaystack", type: 1 },
                             { bucketSize: <bucket value> })

By default, all queries on a geospatial haystack index returns 50
documents.

For example, to index all restaurants in a particular area with a
given maximum distance of 6 degrees longitude or latitude to accelerate
searches in this area, create the index using the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.ensureIndex({ loc: "geoHaystack", type: 1} ,
                         { bucketSize: 6 } )

.. _geospatial-spherical-representation:

Spatial Representation Systems
------------------------------

MongoDB supports two systems for representing and returning geospatial
results. The default representation is flat and assumes coordinates
points are on a flat surface. This representation is sufficient
for many applications. For coordinate points that refer to locations on a spherical
surface, (i.e. coordinates on Earth) spherical queries will provide
results that factor in the Earth's curvature.

.. note::

   There is no difference between flat and spherical *data* as stored
   in MongoDB. Rather, the only difference between spherical and flat
   geospatial systems in MongoDB is in the **queries**.

For more information on query operations for spherical systems see the
:ref:`spherical queries <geospatial-query-spherical>` section.

.. _geospatial-geohash:

Geohash
-------

To create a geospatial index, MongoDB computes the :term:`geohash`
value for the coordinate pair in the specified values. 

Geohash values are generated by continuously dividing a 2D map into
quadrants. Each quadrant is assigned a two bit value. An example two bit
assignment for each quadrant could be:

.. code-block:: javascript

   01  11

   00  10

These two bit values, ``00``, ``01``, ``10``, and ``11``, each
represent one of the four quadrants. If a point exists in any of these
quadrants, a set of two bits will be assigned to describe the
location. (i.e. top left is ``01`` )

To provide greater precision, the geohash representation divides each
original quadrant into sub-quadrants. The geohash identifies each
sub-quandrant by the concatenation of the geohash of the containing
quadrant (e.g. 01) and the quadrant's own identifier. Therefore, for
the upper-right quadrant, ``01``, the sub-quadrants would be:
``0100``, ``0101``, ``0110``, and ``0111``.

As the :term:`geoHash` calculation continues to divide the coordinate
plane, another two bit value is assigned. To increase the accuracy of
this representation, create a :term:`geohash` with more divisions, or
a higher number of ``bits``.
