   The ``replSetGetStatus`` command returns the status of the replica
   set from the point of view of the current server. You must run the
   command against the admin database. The command has the following
   prototype format:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetGetStatus: 1 }

   However, you can also run this command from the shell like so:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.status()

   .. slave-ok, admin-only
