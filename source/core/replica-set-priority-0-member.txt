A :rsconf:`priority 0 <members[n].priority>` member is a member that
**cannot** become :term:`primary` and **cannot** trigger
:term:`elections <election>`.

Other than the aforementioned restrictions, secondaries that have
:rsconf:`priority 0 <members[n].priority>` function as normal
secondaries: they maintains a copy of the data set, accept read
operations, and vote in elections.

Configure a secondary to have *priority 0* to prevent it from
becoming primary, which is particularly useful in multi-data center
deployments.

For example, in the following diagram, one data center hosts the
primary and a secondary. A second data center hosts a secondary with
*priority 0*. Only the members in data center 1 can become primary.

Priority 0 Members as Standbys
------------------------------

A secondary with :rsconf:`priority 0 <members[n].priority>` can
function as a standby. In some replica sets, it might not be possible
to add a new member in a reasonable amount of time. A standby member
keeps a current copy of the data to be able to replace an unavailable
member.

In many cases, you need not set standby to *priority 0*. However, in replica
sets with varied hardware or :ref:`geographic distribution
<replica-set-geographical-distribution>`, a *priority 0* standby
ensures that only certain members become primary.

A *priority 0* standby may also be valuable for some members of a set
with different hardware or workload profiles. In these cases, deploy a
member with *priority 0* so it can't become primary. Also consider
using an :ref:`hidden member <replica-set-hidden-members>` for this
purpose.

If your set already has seven voting members, also configure the
member as :ref:`non-voting <replica-set-non-voting-members>`.

Failover Considerations
-----------------------

When configuring a secondary to have :rsconf:`priority 0
<members[n].priority>`, consider potential failover patterns, including
all possible network partitions. Always ensure that your main data
center contains both a quorum of voting members and members that are
eligible to be primary.
