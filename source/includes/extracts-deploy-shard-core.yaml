ref: deploy-sharded-cluster-name
content: |
  - :guilabel:`Cluster Name`
  - Specify the name of your sharded cluster deployment. You cannot 
    change this once set. 
---
ref: deploy-sharded-csrs-name
content: |
  - :guilabel:`Config Server Replica Set Name`
  - Specify the name of your :manual:`Config Server Replica Set 
    </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers/>`. You cannot
    change this once set. This setting corresponds to the 
    :rsconf:`_id <rsconf._id>` replica configuration option.

    |mms| only displays this option if you selected
    MongoDB 3.2 or later as the :guilabel:`Version` of your
    configuration servers.

---
ref: deploy-sharded-shard-name
content: |
  - :guilabel:`Shard Name Prefix`
  - Specify the prefix of each :term:`shard` in the cluster. |mms| 
    names each shard in the cluster using the ``<prefix_n>`` format, 
    where ``n`` is a 0-indexed, monotonically increasing integer.
---
ref: deploy-sharded-process-name
content: |

  - :guilabel:`Process Name`
  - Hostname and port of a |mongod| or |mongos| associated to the
    sharded cluster. This hostname can be a hostname, an |fqdn|, an
    |ipv4| address, or an |ipv6| address.

    |mms| groups |mongod| processes under their parent replica set
    name, and |mongos| processes under :guilabel:`mongoses`. |mms| then
    groups all the cluster components under the cluster name. Click the
    :icon:`caret-right` to the left of a grouping to list its
    sub-groups or processes. Modifying any of the available settings
    for a grouping changes the corresponding value in its sub-groups
    and processes.

    .. note::

       For clusters running MongoDB 3.0 or earlier, |mms| groups
       the config server |mongod| processes under
       :guilabel:`configServers`.
