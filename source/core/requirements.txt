This section describes the hardware, software, and networking
requirements for the hosts that run the
:doc:`Ops Manager components </core/system-overview>`.

.. important::
   Before deploying hosts, use the :doc:`/core/installation-checklist`
   to plan your configuration.

For requirements for the MongoDB instances running as the |onprem|
Application Database and the Backup Database, see
:doc:`/tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances`.

.. _hardware-requirements:

Hardware Requirements
---------------------

.. note::

   When using the term *hardware* on this page, it should be
   understood as the specifications per host using one of the
   following architectures:

   - physical hardware,
   - hardware components allocated to a virtual host,
   - hardware components allocated to a virtual container, or
   - hardware components allocated to a Kubernetes Worker Node.

Each host must meet the total *RAM* and *disk capacity* requirements
for all |onprem| components that it serves:

- |onprem| application
- |onprem| application databases
- Head databases for the active Backup Daemon(s)
- Backup blockstore databases

.. example::

   You want to serve both the |onprem| application and a
   :term:`Backup Daemon` on one host. This |onprem| configuration will
   manage and monitor 300 MongoDB hosts and back up 200 hosts. The
   total disk capacity of all databases being backed up is 4 TB. The
   total requirements would be:

   - |onprem| application needs 15 GB of RAM.
   - The Backup Daemon also needs:

     - 15 GB of RAM and
     - 2.5 times the 4 TB of backed up databases in disk capacity.

   This example host would require a minimum of 30 GB of RAM and 10 TB
   of disk capacity.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/warning-follow-requirements.rst

.. _application-hardware-requirements:

|onprem| Hardware Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every host that serves the |onprem| application must meet the
following hardware requirements:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Number of Monitored Hosts
     - CPU Cores
     - Physical Memory [1]_
     - Disk

   * - Up to 400 monitored hosts
     - 4+
     - 15 GB
     - 10 GB for |application| in ``/opt`` plus storage for logs [2]_

   * - Up to 2,000 monitored hosts
     - 8+
     - 15 GB
     - 10 GB for |application| in ``/opt`` plus storage for logs [2]_

   * - More than 2,000 hosts
     - Contact MongoDB Account Manager
     - Contact MongoDB Account Manager
     - Contact MongoDB Account Manager

.. [1] *Physical Memory*, in this context, means resident memory
       displayed as ``RES`` in the ``ps`` command results on Linux 
       platforms and :guilabel:`Memory` displayed in the
       :guilabel:`Task Manager` on Windows platforms. This applies to
       virtual machines and containers as well, even though their
       physical memory is a virtual construct.

.. [2] Storage capacity needed for logs depends on how you
       :ref:`configure-mms-log-rotation`. By default, logs rotate every
       gigabyte and every 24 hours, whichever comes first.
       Conservative estimates require allocating 30 GB of disk for
       each month of logs you want to keep. Review your disk
       allocation and log rotation settings for the optimal disk
       configuration.

.. _mms-application-database-specifications:

|onprem| Application Database Hardware Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`Ops Manager Application Database <mms-application-database>`
runs as a three-member :term:`replica set` that runs on dedicated
hosts.

Every host that serves the |onprem| Application Database must meet the
following hardware (physical or virtual) requirements:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 30 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Number of
       Monitored Hosts
     - RAM
     - Disk Capacity

   * - Up to 400
     - 8 GB RAM plus the RAM required for |onprem| application
     - 200 GB

   * - Up to 2,000
     - 15 GB RAM plus the RAM required for |onprem| application
     - 500 GB

   * - More than 2,000
     - Contact your MongoDB Account Manager
     - Contact your MongoDB Account Manager

For the best performance, use:

- SSDs to store your |onprem|
  :doc:`Application Databases </tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>`.

- The WiredTiger storage engine. For the differences between the
  WiredTiger and MMAPv1 storage engines, see
  :manual:`the types of storage engines </core/storage-engines/>` in
  the MongoDB manual.

Disk capacity estimates are *approximate*. The needed disk capacity can
increase *or* decrease due to the number of databases being monitored.

.. _backup-hardware-requirements:

Backup Daemon Hardware Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   Before getting started with Backup, *contact your MongoDB Account
   Manager* to help estimate the storage requirements for your Backup
   Daemon host.

Each host on which you activate the :term:`Backup Daemon` must meet
the following requirements plus
:ref:`those for Ops Manager <application-hardware-requirements>`.

Each host that serves an active Backup Daemon has the following
hardware requirements:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: FCV of 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 20, 40, 40

         * - Number of hosts
           - CPU Cores
           - RAM

         * - Up to 200
           - 4+ × 2 GHz+
           - 15 GB additional RAM

      The Backup Daemon creates :term:`head databases <head database>`
      that replicate data for each replica set assigned to the Daemon.
      Typically, each host on which you activate the Backup Daemon
      needs to store 2.0 to 2.5 times the sum of the size on disk of
      all the backed-up replica sets.

      Specifically, each host must have:

      - The disk capacity and write capacity to maintain each head
        database, **plus**

      - The disk capacity to store an additional copy of the data for
        each head database to support
        :term:`point-in-time restores <point-in-time restore>`.

   .. tab:: FCV of 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      The Backup Daemon should have at least 100 GB of available disk
      capacity.

Contact your MongoDB Account Manager to determine disk capacity and
throughput requirements.

.. _backup-database-specifications:

Backup Database Hardware Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use |onprem| Backup, you must provision hosts for the Backup
Database.

Host requirements for the Backup Database vary, depending on whether
you use a blockstore database or file system storage to store your
:term:`snapshots <snapshot>`. The Backup Database always holds
:term:`oplog` data.

If you store snapshots in the Backup Database, its hosts typically
must have enough capacity to store 2 to 3 times the total backed-up
production data size. Snapshots are compressed and de-duplicated at
the block level in the :term:`blockstore <backup blockstore database>`.

Your specific requirements depend on your data compressibility and
change rate. *Contact your MongoDB Account Manager* to help estimate
the use case and workload-dependent storage requirements for your
Backup Database hosts.

If you store snapshots in the Backup Database, each data-bearing member
must meet the following requirements:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - CPU Cores
     - RAM

   * - 4 × 2 GHz+
     - 8 GB of RAM per TB of blockstore disk to provide
       good snapshot and restore speed. |onprem| defines 1 TB of
       blockstore as 1024\ :sup:`4` bytes.

Contact your MongoDB Account Manager to determine disk capacity and
throughput requirements.

If you will *not* store snapshots in the Backup Database, each
data-bearing member must meet the following requirements:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - CPU Cores
     - Disk Capacity

   * - 4 × 2 GHz+
     - The size of your oplogs compressed for the
       :ref:`configured point in time window <edit-snapshot-schedule>`.
       The default is 24 hours.

.. _network-requirements:

Network Requirements
--------------------

Internet Site Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you configured |onprem| to download binaries direct from the
Internet, |onprem| requires access to the following Internet sites over
|https| using both |ipv4| and |ipv6| requests to the Internet:

.. include:: /includes/list-table-needed-mongodb-sites-over-internet.rst

Latency between |onprem| and Backing Database Hosts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connections between the |application| host and its Application
Database, Oplog, and blockstore replica sets must have the lowest
possible network latency. With deployments exceeding 200 MongoDB hosts,
latency between your |application| components should be under 1 ms.
Please :website:`contact MongoDB Support </contact>`
if you anticipate that your network environment cannot meet this
requirement.

.. _onprem-tcp-keepalive:

TCP Keepalive Setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many |onprem| components connect to a running |mongod| process. These
include:

- the application database,
- any backup databases, and
- any MongoDB databases that the {+mdbagent+} manages.

The systems that host these components send data traffic to each other
to verify an active connection. The |tcp| keepalive setting determines
how often to run this check. Most systems use the default value of
**7200** seconds (two hours).

The network connection may drop within that timeframe. Without an
existing connection, |onprem| must create a new connection to that
|mongod| process. This can delay communication or result in network
timeouts or socket errors. To prevent this issue, reduce the keepalive
value to increase the verification checks. All |onprem| components must
use the same keepalive value.

To learn how to set this to the recommended value, see
:ref:`faq-keepalive` in the MongoDB Server Manual.


MongoDB and MongoDB Agent Host Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each MongoDB and {+mdbagent+} host should self-identify as its |fqdn|
to ensure reliable connectivity.

.. include:: /includes/fact-find-fqdn.rst

Accessible Ports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |application| must be able to connect to users and MongoDB
Agents over |http| or |https|. MongoBD Agents must be able to
connect to MongoDB client MongoDB databases.

Though |mms| only requires open |http| (or |https|) and MongoDB
network ports to connect with users and to databases, what ports are
opened on a firewall depend upon what capabilities are enabled:
encryption, authentication and monitoring.

This page defines which systems need to connect to which ports on
other systems.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/firewall-configuration.rst

.. include:: /includes/requirements-hostnames.rst

.. _software-requirements:

Software Requirements
---------------------

Hosts that run |onprem| components must meet the following software
requirements:

.. important::

   |onprem| 5.0 and higher requires Bash 4.2 or higher.
