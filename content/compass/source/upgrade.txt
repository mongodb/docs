To ensure that you are using the latest |compass-short| features and
improvements, we recommend using the latest version of
|compass|. To upgrade |compass-short|, you can either
manually install the latest version or enable automatic updates.

.. important::

   |compass| undergoes continuous development, with the latest stable versions
   receiving active support and updates. We encourage using the latest release for optimal
   functionality and security. 

Manually Install the Latest Version of Compass
----------------------------------------------

You can download and install the latest version of Compass from the
`MongoDB Downloads
<https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/compass?tck=docs_compass>`__ page at
any time. Check the :ref:`Software Requirements <software-reqs>` for
your operating system and desired version of Compass to ensure Compass
is compatible with your system. You do not need to uninstall previous
versions of Compass to upgrade.

.. note::

   If you are running macOS Catalina or later, you may have to modify
   your system settings to grant |compass-short| permission to run. For
   more information, see :ref:`Install Compass <compass-install>`.

.. _enable-automatic-updates:

Enable Automatic Updates
------------------------

You can enable automatic updates to the latest version of Compass in the 
:guilabel:`Privacy` section of the :guilabel:`MongoDB Compass > Settings` 
dialog.

If you enable auto updates and did not downgrade |compass|,
|compass-short| automatically updates the application when MongoDB
releases new versions. The update does not require your explicit
confirmation. After your machine finishes the update, |compass-short|
shows a notification suggesting that you restart the application to
apply the update. |compass-short| does not apply the version update
until you restart the application. 

If you enable auto updates and downgraded |compass| by manually
installing an earlier version, |compass-short| does not automatically
update when MongoDB releases a new version. If a newer version is
available, |compass-short| asks you to confirm that you want to install
the update through a notification. You can dismiss the notification to
avoid updating. 

To update |compass-short| before the next automatic update, click
:guilabel:`Check for updates` in the :guilabel:`MongoDB Compass` system
menu:

If an update is available, |compass-short| shows a notification that
asks if you want to install and restart the application immediately. 

While an update is in progress, |compass-short| disables the
:guilabel:`Check for updates` menu option and shows that your machine is
installing an update. 

.. _keychain-access:

Allow Keychain Access for Recent and Favorite Connections
---------------------------------------------------------

On macOS systems, the first time that you update |compass| to version
1.20 or later, you will need to allow access to your system storage
**for each** saved connection in :guilabel:`Recents` and
:guilabel:`Favorites`.

When prompted for your keychain password, click :guilabel:`Always Allow`
to prevent being prompted for your password in the future. This
ensures |compass| has access to your saved connections when updating
to new versions.

.. _migrate-from-community:

Migrate to Compass from Compass Community
-----------------------------------------

To migrate from Compass Community edition to the fully-featured
edition of Compass and retain any saved data such as saved connection
strings and favorite queries, you must migrate that data to your
new edition of |compass|.

|compass| stores saved connections, queries, and aggregation pipelines
in folders in your file system. You can copy these folders to the
corresponding folder for your upgraded Compass version to avoid
recreating your saved data. 

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

1. Download the fully-featured edition of |compass| from the
   {+download-page+}.

#. Refer to the following table to see where your |compass| data
