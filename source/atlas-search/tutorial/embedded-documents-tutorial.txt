This tutorial describes how to index and run queries against fields in 
documents that are inside an array. This tutorial takes you through the 
following steps:

1. Create a sample collection named ``schools`` with embedded documents 
   in your |service| {+cluster+}.
#. Set up an |fts| index with :ref:`embeddedDocuments
   <bson-data-types-embedded-documents>` fields configured at the
   following paths: 
   
   - ``teachers`` field
   - ``teachers.classes`` field 
   - ``clubs.sports`` field
  
#. Run |fts| queries that search the embedded documents in the  
   the ``schools`` collection using the :ref:`compound-ref` operator with 
   the :ref:`embedded-document-ref` and :ref:`text-ref` operators.

Before you begin, ensure that your |service| {+cluster+} meets the 
requirements described in the :ref:`fts-tutorials-prereqs`. For this 
tutorial, you don't need to upload the sample data because you will 
create a new collection and load the documents that you need to run the 
queries in this tutorial.

Create a Sample Collection and Load the Data 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each document in the sample collection named ``schools`` contains the 
``name`` and ``mascot`` of the school, school teacher's ``first`` and 
``last`` name, the ``classes`` that each teacher teaches including the 
``subject`` name and ``grade`` level, and the various ``clubs`` for the
school students.

You must begin by creating a collection named ``schools`` in an 
existing or new database on your |service| {+cluster+}. After creating the 
collection, you must upload the sample data into your collection. 
The steps in this section walk you through creating a new database 
and collection, and loading the sample data into your collection.

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Log in to |service| and navigate to the :guilabel:`Collections` tab.
    
      a. Log in to your {+cluster+}.
      #. Click your {+cluster+} name.
      #. Click :guilabel:`Collections`.

   .. step:: Create a new collection. 

      a. Click :guilabel:`Create Database` to create a new database.
      #. Enter the database name and collection name.
         
         - In the :guilabel:`Database Name` field, specify
           ``local_school_district``.
         - For the :guilabel:`Collection Name` field, specify
           ``schools``.

   .. step:: Load the following documents into the collection. 

      a. Select the ``schools`` collection if it's not selected.
      #. Click :guilabel:`Insert Document` for each of the sample 
         documents to add to the collection.
      #. Click the |json| view (:guilabel:`{}`) to replace the default 
         document.
      #. Copy and paste the following sample documents, one at a time, 
         and click :guilabel:`Insert` to add the documents, one at a 
         time, to the collection.

Create an |fts| Index 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section, you will create an |fts| index for the fields in the 
embedded documents in the ``local_school_district.schools`` collection. 

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Navigate to the |fts| page for your project.

      a. If it isn't already displayed, select the organization that
         contains your desired project from the |ui-org-menu| in the
         navigation bar.

      #. If it isn't already displayed, select your desired project
         from the :guilabel:`Projects` menu in the navigation bar.

      #. Click your {+cluster+}\'s name.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Search` tab.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Create Index`.

   .. step:: Select a :guilabel:`Configuration Method` and click :guilabel:`Next`. 

      - For a guided experience, select :guilabel:`Visual Editor`.
      - To edit the raw index definition, select :guilabel:`JSON
        Editor`. 

   .. step:: Enter the :guilabel:`Index Name`, and set the :guilabel:`Database and Collection`.

      a. In the :guilabel:`Index Name` field, enter ``embedded-documents-tutorial``.

         .. include:: /includes/default-fts-index-name.rst 

      #. In the :guilabel:`Database and Collection` section, find the 
         ``local_school_district`` database, and select the ``schools`` 
         collection.

   .. step:: Specify an index configuration that indexes embedded documents.

      The following index definition specifies that documents in the
      arrays at the ``teachers`` and ``teachers.classes`` paths must be
      indexed as :ref:`bson-data-types-embedded-documents`, and the
      fields inside the documents must be dynamically indexed.

      .. tabs:: 

         .. tab:: Visual Editor 
            :tabid: vib

            a. Click :guilabel:`Next`.
            #. Click :guilabel:`Refine Your Index`.
            #. In the :guilabel:`Field Mappings` section, click
               :guilabel:`Add Field Mapping`. 
            #. Select the following from the dropdown. 

               .. list-table::

                  * - :guilabel:`Data Type`
                    - :guilabel:`EmbeddedDocuments`
                     
            #. Toggle to enable :guilabel:`Enable Dynamic Mapping` if it
               isn't already enabled and click :guilabel:`Add`
            #. Click :guilabel:`Add Embedded Field` associated with the
               :guilabel:`teachers` field in the :guilabel:`Field
               Mappings` table. 
            #. Select the following from the dropdown. 

               .. list-table:: 
                  :stub-columns: 1

                  * - :guilabel:`Field Name`
                    - ``teachers.classes`` 

                  * - :guilabel:`Data Type`
                    - :guilabel:`EmbeddedDocuments`

            #. Toggle to enable :guilabel:`Enable Dynamic Mapping` if it
               isn't already enabled and click :guilabel:`Add`
            #. Click :guilabel:`Add Field Mappings` to open the
               :guilabel:`Add Field Mapping` window.
            #. Select the following from the dropdown. 

               .. list-table:: 
                  :stub-columns: 1

                  * - :guilabel:`Field Name`
                    - ``clubs.sports`` 

                  * - :guilabel:`Data Type`
                    - :guilabel:`EmbeddedDocuments`

            #. Toggle to enable :guilabel:`Enable Dynamic Mapping` if it

            #. Click :guilabel:`Save`.
            #. Click :guilabel:`Save Changes`.

         .. tab:: JSON Editor 
            :tabid: jsonib

            a. Replace the default index definition with the following 
               index definition.

               .. code-block:: json 
                  :linenos: 

                  {
                    "mappings": {

                          "fields": {
                            "sports": {
                              "dynamic": true,
                              "type": "embeddedDocuments"
                            }
                          },
                          "type": "document"
                        },
                        "teachers": {
                          "type": "embeddedDocuments",
                          "dynamic": true,
                          "fields": {
                            "classes": {
                              "dynamic": true,
                              "type": "embeddedDocuments"
                            }
                          }
                        }
                      }
                    }
                  }

            #. Click :guilabel:`Next`.
            
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Create Search Index`.

      |service| displays a modal window to let you know your index is
      building.  

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Close` button and wait for the index to finish building. 

      The index should take about one minute to build. While it is 
      building, the :guilabel:`Status` column reads ``Build in
      Progress``. When it is finished building, the :guilabel:`Status`
      column reads ``Active``. 

Run |fts| Queries Against Embedded Document Fields 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run queries against the embedded document fields. This 
tutorial uses :ref:`embedded-document-ref` and :ref:`text-ref` 
operators inside the :ref:`compound-ref` operator in the queries. 

In this section, you will connect to your |service| {+cluster+} and run 
the sample queries using the operators against the fields in the 
``schools`` collection.
