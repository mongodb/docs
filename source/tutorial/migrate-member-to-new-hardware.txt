Overview
--------

You can replace one member of a managed :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` with another member
from the |mms| console. Use this process to migrate members of replica sets to
new underlying servers. This procedure requires that you:

1. Provision the new server.

2. Add an extra member to the replica set.

3. Shut down old member of the replica set.

4. Un-manage the old member (Optional).

Considerations
--------------

Initial Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you add a new replica set member, the member must perform an
:opsmgr:`inital sync </reference/glossary/#std-term-initial-sync>`, which takes time to complete, depending on the
size of your data set. For more information on initial sync, see
:manual:`Replica Set Data Synchronization </core/replica-set-sync>`.

Migrating Multiple Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removing members during migration might affect the ability of the replica set
to acknowledge writes, depending on the level of :term:`write concern` you
use. For more information, see :manual:`Write Concern
</reference/write-concern>` in the MongoDB manual.

Procedure
---------

Perform this procedure separately for each member of a replica set to
migrate.
