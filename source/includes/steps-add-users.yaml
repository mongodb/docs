     * - Field

       - Description

     * - :guilabel:`User Name`

       - The user's login name. All MongoDB users for |service| are
         associated with the ``admin`` database; i.e. their
         :ref:`authentication database <user-authentication-database>`
         is ``admin``. To access MongoDB, a user provides a username and the name of the
         authentication database, as well as a password. The authentication
         database does not determine the user's roles.

         You can assign a user different roles in different databases. For
         example, you can create a user to have the
         :authrole:`readWrite` role on the ``test`` database but only the
         :authrole:`read` role on the ``production`` database. The
         authentication database would still be ``admin``.

     * - :guilabel:`User Privileges`

       - You can assign roles in one of the following ways:

         - Select :atlasrole:`Atlas admin`, which provides the user with
           privileges to administer the |service| group's clusters, or

         - Select :atlasrole:`Read and write to any database`, which
           provides the user with privileges to read and write to any
           database, or

         - Select :atlasrole:`Only read any database` which provides the user
           with privileges to read any database, or

         - Click ``Show Advanced Options`` and select an individual
           role/privilege and specify the database. Optionally, for the
           ``read`` and ``readWrite`` role, you can also
           specify a collection. If you do not specify a collection for
           ``read`` and ``readWrite``, the role applies to
           all collections (excluding some ``system.`` collections) in
           the database.

         For information on these privileges, see :ref:`atlas-user-privileges`.

         For more information on authorization, see :manual:`Role-Based
         Access Control </core/authorization>` and :manual:`Built-in
         Roles </core/security-built-in-roles>` in the MongoDB manual.

     * - :guilabel:`Password`

       - The user's password.

         |service| clusters use :manual:`SCRAM-SHA-1
         </core/security-scram-sha-1>` to authenticate MongoDB users.
