"MongoDB provides complete support for indexes on any field in a "
":term:`collection` of :term:`documents <document>`. By default, all "
"collections have an index on the :ref:`_id field <index-type-id>`, and "
"applications and users may add additional indexes to support important "
"queries and operations."

"MongoDB creates the ``_id`` index, which is an ascending :ref:`unique index "

"Think of the ``_id`` field as the :term:`primary key` for a collection. "
"Every document *must* have a unique ``_id`` field. You may store any unique "
"value in the ``_id`` field. The default value of ``_id`` is an "
":term:`ObjectId` which is generated when the client inserts the document. An"
