Solution Overview
-----------------

Manufacturing is experiencing a profound transformation through the
integration of real-time data and centralized data management tools like
the Unified Namespace (UNS) model. Modern factories generate vast
amounts of data from various systems like enterprise resource planning
(ERP), manufacturing execution system (MES), and shop floor machines. As
manufacturers move towards connected and automated systems, unifying
these data sources is crucial. `Deloitte reports
<https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/manufacturing/manufacturing-industry-outlook.html>`__
that smart factory initiatives can boost productivity by up to 12% and
improve equipment effectiveness by up to 20%. Achieving these gains
requires an effective data management strategy, one that leverages UNS
models supported by robust solutions like MongoDB.

The unified approach facilitates real-time data visibility and seamless
integration, helping to optimize processes and enhance operational
efficiency. By breaking down traditional hierarchical data flows,
manufacturers can leverage both historical and real-time insights for
strategic planning and continuous improvements.

An effective UNS system proactively integrates and contextualizes data,
taking steps to achieve organizational objectives without needing
constant human intervention. Rather than merely reporting isolated data
points, a UNS using MongoDB can autonomously unify and analyze data from
diverse manufacturing systems, uncover critical insights, and facilitate
informed decision-making.

In this solution, we develop a comprehensive Unified Namespace framework
using MongoDB’s capabilities for flexible data modeling, real-time
processing, and scalability.

The setup ingests various operational data types, analyzes streams for
actionable insights, stores the information in MongoDB, and provides
strategic recommendations based on comprehensive analytics with data
from different sources and types.

Reference Architectures

   Figure 1. Leafy Factory UNS architecture

In the `Leafy Factory demo
<https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/leafy_factory>`__, SQL
data from a simulated MES is efficiently ingested into MongoDB,
encompassing key production planning, monitoring, and quality metrics.
This data, captured in MongoDB's flexible, document-based JSON format,
ensures that MES information remains organized and readily accessible
for real-time analysis and reporting. Similarly, SQL-based ERP data—such
as work orders, material tracking, and cost breakdowns—is seamlessly
integrated using a combination of Kafka change streams and the MongoDB
Sink connector. The SQL data is ingested into Kafka topics through the
Debezium connector, with SQL functioning as a Kafka producer. This data
is then consumed, transformed, and inserted into MongoDB via the
`MongoDB Sink connector
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kafka-connector/current/sink-connector/>`__,
establishing a seamless data flow between SQL, Kafka, and MongoDB. This
process ensures that ERP data remains continuously synchronized in
MongoDB, highlighting its reliability as a live source of crucial
business information.

Simultaneously, simulated MQTT data streams deliver real-time shop floor
data into the database, including machine status, quality outputs, and
sensor readings like temperature and vibration. MongoDB's robust support
for real-time ingestion allows this data to be immediately available,
facilitating up-to-date machine monitoring and quicker response times.

`Change streams
<https://www.mongodb.com/resources/products/capabilities/change-streams>`__
are pivotal, enabling real-time data updates across systems. For
instance, when a work order is updated in the ERP system, this change is
instantly reflected downstream in MES and shop floor views, showcasing
MongoDB's capability for bi-directional data flows and live
synchronization within a unified data model.

Additionally, the demo highlights the importance of data
contextualization and enrichment. As data enters the UNS, MongoDB
enriches it with metadata such as machine ID, operator name, and
location following the ISA95 structure. This enriched model supports
fine-grained analysis and filtering, essential for generating
actionable, cross-functional insights across manufacturing, operations,
and business teams.

The Leafy Factory demo validates MongoDB's technical strengths—including
real-time processing, flexible data modeling, and scalable
architecture—and demonstrates how these capabilities coalesce to support
a robust, dynamic, and future-ready Unified Namespace for smart
manufacturing.

   .. step:: Data ingestion with MQTT broker

      The solution begins by employing Cedalo's Mosquitto MQTT Broker to
      handle real-time data streams from shop floor machines. This
      broker efficiently gathers data, such as machine status and sensor
      readings (including temperature and vibration), ensuring seamless
      and immediate data transfer. The architecture remains
      broker-agnostic, capable of integrating with various other MQTT
      providers as needed.

   .. step:: SQL data integration via Kafka Connector

      Concurrent with MQTT data reception, SQL data from ERP and MES systems
      is ingested using Kafka. The Debezium connector captures SQL-based
      data—such as work orders, material tracking, and cost breakdowns—and
      streams it into Kafka topics. Kafka Connector then processes
      this data, transforming and inserting it into MongoDB Atlas, which
      facilitates efficient synchronization between SQL systems and MongoDB.
      This integration ensures that ERP data remains continuously updated,
      serving as a reliable source of live business-critical information.

   .. step:: Database management with MongoDB Atlas

      MongoDB Atlas acts as the central repository, leveraging its flexible
      schema capabilities to accommodate diverse data structures, from raw
      machine sensor data to structured ERP records. By storing data in a
      document-oriented format, manufacturers can effortlessly adapt to
      changes, such as incorporating new sensors or modifying machine
      attributes. Atlas not only simplifies data management but also supports
      real-time ingestion across multiple sources.
