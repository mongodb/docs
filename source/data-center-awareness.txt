Data Center Awareness
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB provides a number of features that allow application
developers and database administrators to customize the behavior of a
:term:`sharded cluster` or :term:`replica set` deployment so that
MongoDB may be *more* "data center aware," or allow operational
separation and location-based separation.

MongoDB also supports segregation based
on functional parameters, to ensure that certain :program:`mongod`
instances are only used for reporting workloads or that certain
high-frequency portions of a sharded collection only exist on specific
shards.

Consider the following documents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   /administration/operational-segregation
   /administration/tag-aware-sharding
   /tutorial/deploy-geographically-distributed-replica-set

Additionally, consider the :ref:`replica-set-write-concern` and
:ref:`replica-set-read-preference` sections of the
:doc:`/applications/replication` document, which addresses
capabilities related to data center awareness.
