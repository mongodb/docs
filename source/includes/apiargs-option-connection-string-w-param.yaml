  The driver will *not* acknowledge write operations but will pass or
  handle any network and socket errors that it receives to the client.

  You can specify the write concern both in the connection string and
  as a parameter to method calls like ``insert`` or ``update``. If the
  write concern is specified in both places, the method parameter
  overrides the connection-string setting.

  Provides basic acknowledgment of write operations. By specifying
  ``1``, you require that a standalone :program:`mongod` instance, or
  the primary for :term:`replica sets <replica set>`, acknowledge all
  write operations. For drivers released after the :doc:`default write
  concern change </release-notes/drivers-write-concern>`, this is the
  default write concern setting.

  For replica sets, if you specify the special ``majority`` value to
  :data:`~uri.w` option, write operations will only return successfully
  after a majority of the configured replica set members have
  acknowledged the write operation.

  For replica sets, if you specify a number ``n`` greater than 1,
  operations with this write concern return only after ``n`` members of
  the set have acknowledged the write. If you set ``n`` to a number that
  is greater than the number of available set members or members that
  hold data, MongoDB will wait, potentially indefinitely, for these
  members to become available.

  For replica sets, you can specify a :ref:`tag set
  <replica-set-configuration-tag-sets>` to require that all members of
  the set that have these tags configured return confirmation of the
  write operation. See :ref:`Replica Set Tag Set Configuration
  <replica-set-configuration-tag-sets>` for more information.
