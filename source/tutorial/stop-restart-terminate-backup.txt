Overview
--------

When you stop backups for a replica set or sharded cluster |mms| stops
taking new snapshots but retains existing snapshots until their listed
expiration date.

If you later restart backups for replica set or cluster, |mms| might
perform an :term:`initial sync`, depending on how much time has elapsed.

If you **terminate** a backup, |mms| immediately **deletes all the
backup's snapshots.**

   Force Terminate a Deployment's Backups
   --------------------------------------

   If your attempt to terminate backups fails and you still need to
   terminate regardless of any errors, you can force terminate the
   backups.

   .. note:: 

      If you wish to Force Terminate backups on a sharded cluster, you
      must repeat the following steps for each backup job on each shard
      or config server.

   .. important::
      You should make sure that the Backup Job you want to terminate is
      in the :guilabel:`Terminating` state.
