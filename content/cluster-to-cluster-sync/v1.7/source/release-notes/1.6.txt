Patch Releases
--------------

.. _1.6.1-c2c-release-notes:

1.6.1 Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**October 3, 2023**

Issues Fixed:

- Fixed a bug that can cause long running ``mongosync`` operations to
  prematurely timeout. Now, ``mongosync`` produces
  fewer ``MaxTimeMSExpired`` errors during the collection copy phase.

.. _1.6.0-c2c-release-notes:

1.6.0 Release
-------------

**September 22, 2023**

Exclusion Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 1.6.0, the :ref:`c2c-api-start` API endpoint now supports the
use of exclusion filters through the ``excludeNamespaces`` parameter.

For more information, see :ref:`c2c-filtered-sync`.

Regular Expression Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both inclusion and exclusion filters in :ref:`c2c-filtered-sync` now 
support matching databases and collections using Regular Expressions 
with the ``databaseRegex`` and ``collectionsRegex`` fields.

For more information, see :ref:`c2c-filter-regex`.

7.0 Support
~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 1.6.0, ``mongosync`` supports sync with MongoDB 7.0.

Other Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~

New Features:

- Sped up the commit process by parallelizing metadata cleanup. 

- Reduced memory allocation during change event application by approximately 
  30% for pre-6.0 releases of MongoDB Server versions.

- Changed telemetry to also send error messages to Segment when ``mongosync``
  exits with a fatal error.

- Added support for ``mongosync`` to sync between source and destination 
  clusters that have the same major and minor versions, but different 
  patch versions.

- Upgraded build to use Go 1.20.

- ``mongosync`` now periodically logs when server operations take a longer 
  than expected time.

Issues Fixed:

- Fixed a bug introduced in ``mongosync`` v1.5.0 and discovered by our internal
  testing where in an unlikely edge case ``mongosync`` can miss a change event 
  to be applied during the Collection Copy phase. 
  
  In order for this bug to occur, the change event must fall between a specific 
  ``_id`` range that ``mongosync`` is in the process of copying, must occur and 
  be processed while that specific ``_id`` range is being copied, and must not 
  be followed by another change event for the same ``_id`` throughout the rest 
  of the migration. 
  
  This bug only occurs when ``mongosync`` is processing change events with near
  zero replication lag during Collection Copy.


- Fixed a bug where ``mongosync`` could crash due to the source cluster
  containing legacy indexes with unknown index options.

- Fixed a bug where ``mongosync`` could crash with an error during change event
  application, if the application fails to read 500 documents within 5 minutes
  or reaches the end of the oplog when reading from change streams on the
  source cluster.

- Fixed a bug where ``mongosync`` could crash when indexes apply constraints to
  collection documents.

  This crash occured when such an index was added or dropped at nearly the same
  time as an index that violated these constrains was deleted or inserted.  It
  would manifest with an error like:

  .. code-block:: text
     :copyable: false

     Ambiguous field name found in array (do not use numeric field names in embedded elements in an array)

  or a similar error. This fix makes this crash less likely, but it does not
  elimiate the possibility that it will occur.

- Fixed a bug where ``mongosync`` can fail to copy certain documents if the
  insertion of documents causes duplicate key errors at the same time as a
  write concern error. This bug has been present in mongosync since its first
  release and may have arisen if the destination cluster logs reported a write
  concern error alongside a duplicate key error.

- Fixed a bug introduced in ``mongosync`` 1.5 where change events may be
  skipped during the Collection Copy phase when there is little write activity
  on the source cluster.

- Fixed a rare bug introduced in ``mongosync`` v1.5.0 and discovered by our
  internal testing where there may be a small continuity gap between Oplog
  Rollover Resilience (ORR) cycles in a specific situation, causing the ORR
  mechanism to potentially miss a change event to be applied during the
  Collection Copy phase. 

  This is an extreme case as it requires consistently
  little write activity on the source cluster (i.e. ``mongosync`` replication
  lag is consistently near zero during Collection Copy) as well as the change
  event to fall in specific ``_id`` ranges between ORR cycles.

- Fixed a bug introduced in v1.5.0 where ``mongosync`` could cause data
  consistency errors in collections with non-default collation. 
  
  This issue only affects collections with non-simple collation that are
  present during ``mongosync`` initialization and contain documents with string
  ``_id`` values. Any collections with non-simple collation created after
  ``mongosync`` initialization or whose documents have all non-string ``_id``
  values are unaffected.

  .. note::

     In order to mitigate this issue, ``mongosync`` v1.6.0 automatically
     disables Oplog Rollover Resilience if it finds at least one collection
     with non-simple collation during Mongosync initialization. 
     
     We will investigate a more permanent solution for future releases.

Minimum Supported Version
-------------------------

In 1.6, the minimum supported versions of MongoDB are 6.0.8 and 7.0.0.
