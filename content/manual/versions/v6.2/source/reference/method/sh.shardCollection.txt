.. method:: sh.shardCollection(namespace, key, unique, options)

   .. |command| replace:: :method:`sh.shardCollection`

   Shards a collection using the ``key`` as a the :term:`shard key`.
   The shard key determines how MongoDB distributes the collection's
   documents among the shards.

   .. note::

      .. versionchanged:: 6.0

      Starting in MongoDB 6.0, sharding a collection does **not** require you to
      first run the :method:`sh.enableSharding` method to configure the database.


   .. |dbcommand| replace:: :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command
   .. include:: /includes/fact-mongosh-shell-method-alt.rst


   :method:`sh.shardCollection()` takes the following
   arguments:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Parameter
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``namespace``
   
        - string
   
        - The :term:`namespace` of the collection to shard in the form
          ``"<database>.<collection>"``.

      * - ``key``
   
        - document
   
        - The document that specifies the field or fields to use as the
          :ref:`shard key <sharding-shard-key>`. 
          
          ``{ <field1>: <1|"hashed">, ... }``

          Set the field value to either:
          
          - ``1`` for :doc:`ranged based sharding </core/ranged-sharding>`
          
          - ``"hashed"`` to specify a
            :ref:`hashed shard key <hashed-shard-keys>`.
          
          :ref:`shard key <sharding-shard-key>` must be
          supported by an index. Unless the collection is empty, the
          index must exist prior to the :dbcommand:`shardCollection`
          command. If the collection is empty, MongoDB creates the
          index prior to sharding the collection if the index that can
          support the shard key does not already exist.
          
          See also :ref:`sharding-shard-key-indexes`
          
          
   
      * - ``unique``
   
        - boolean
   
        - Optional. Specify ``true`` to ensure that the underlying index
          enforces a unique constraint. Defaults to ``false``. 

          You cannot specify ``true`` when using :ref:`hashed shard keys 
          <sharding-hashed>`.

          If specifying the ``options`` document, you must explicitly
          specify the value for ``unique``.
   
      * - ``options``
   
        - document
   
        - Optional. A document containing optional fields, including
          ``numInitialChunks`` and ``collation``.
          
          
   


   The ``options`` argument supports the following options:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Parameter
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``numInitialChunks``
   
        - integer
   
        - Optional. Specifies the minimum number of chunks to create
          initially when sharding an *empty* collection with a
          :ref:`hashed shard key <sharding-hashed-sharding>`. MongoDB
          then creates and balances chunks across the cluster. The
          ``numInitialChunks`` must be less than ``8192`` per shard.
          Defaults to ``2``.

          If the collection is not empty or the shard key does not
          contain a hashed field, the operation returns an error.

          - If sharding with :ref:`presplitHashedZones: true
            <method-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>`,
            MongoDB attempts to evenly distribute the specified
            number of chunks across the zones in the cluster.

          - If sharding with :ref:`presplitHashedZones: false
            <method-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>` or omitted and
            no zones and zone ranges are defined for the empty
            collection, MongoDB attempts to evenly distributed the
            specified number of chunks across the shards in the cluster.

          - If sharding with :ref:`presplitHashedZones: false
            <method-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>` or omitted and
            zones and zone ranges have been defined for the empty
            collection, ``numInitChunks`` has no effect.

          .. versionchanged:: 4.4

      * - ``collation``
   
        - document
   
        - Optional. If the collection specified to ``shardCollection``
          has a default :ref:`collation <collation>`, you *must* include 
          a collation document with``{ locale : "simple" }``, or the 
          ``shardCollection`` command fails. At least one of the indexes
          whose fields support the shard key pattern must have the simple
          collation.

      * - :ref:`presplitHashedZones 
          <method-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>`

        - boolean

        - .. _method-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones:
        
          Optional. Specify ``true`` to perform initial chunk creation
          and distribution for an empty or non-existing collection based
          on the defined zones and zone ranges for the collection. For
          :ref:`hashed sharding <sharding-hashed>` only.

          ``shardCollection()`` with ``presplitHashedZones: true`` returns
          an error if any of the following are true:

          - The shard key does not contain a hashed field 
            (i.e. is not a :ref:`single field hashed index 
            <index-hashed-index>` or :ref:`compound hashed index
            <index-type-compound-hashed>`).

          - The collection has no defined zones or zone ranges.

          - The defined zone ranges do not meet the 
            :ref:`requirements 
            <updateZoneKeyRange-method-init-chunk-distribution>`.

Time Series Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 5.1

To create a new :ref:`time series collection
<manual-timeseries-collection>` that is sharded, specify the
:ref:`timeseries <cmd-shard-collection-timeseries>` option to
:method:`sh.shardCollection()`.

The :ref:`timeseries <cmd-shard-collection-timeseries>` option takes
the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``timeField``

Considerations
--------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-cannot-unshard-collection.rst

Shard Keys
~~~~~~~~~~

While you can :ref:`change your shard key <change-a-shard-key>`
later, it is important to carefully consider your shard key choice to
avoid scalability and perfomance issues.

.. seealso::

  - :ref:`sharding-shard-key`
  - :ref:`sharding-shard-key-selection`

Hashed Shard Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Hashed shard keys <sharding-hashed-sharding>` use a
:doc:`hashed index </core/index-hashed>` or  a
:ref:`compound hashed index <index-type-compound-hashed>`
as the shard key.

Use the form ``field: "hashed"`` to specify a hashed shard key field.

.. include:: /includes/note-hashed-shard-key-during-chunk-migration.rst

.. seealso::

   :doc:`/core/hashed-sharding`

.. _sh.shardCollection-zones:

Zone Sharding and Initial Chunk Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/zoned-sharding-shard-operation-chunk-distribution-with-links.rst

See :ref:`pre-define-zone-range-example` for an example. If sharding a
collection using a ranged or single-field hashed shard key, the
``numInitialChunks`` option has no effect if zones and zone ranges have
been defined for the empty collection.

To shard a collection using a :ref:`compound hashed index
<index-type-compound-hashed>`, see
:ref:`sh.shardCollection-zones-compound-hashed`.

.. _sh.shardCollection-zones-compound-hashed:

Initial Chunk Distribution with Compound Hashed Indexes
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/extracts/zoned-sharding-shard-operation-chunk-distribution-hashed-short.rst

The ``numInitialChunks`` option has no effect if zones and zone ranges
have been defined for the empty collection *and*
:ref:`presplitHashedZones <method-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>`
is ``false``.

See :ref:`pre-define-zone-range-hashed-example` for an example.

Uniqueness

Examples
--------

Simple Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given a collection named ``people`` in a database named ``records``,
the following command shards the collection by the
``zipcode`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.shardCollection("records.people", { zipcode: 1 } )

Usage with Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``phonebook`` database has a collection ``contacts`` with no
default :ref:`collation <createCollection-collation-example>`. The 
following example uses
:method:`sh.shardCollection()` to shard the ``phonebook.contacts`` with:

- a :ref:`hashed shard key <sharding-hashed-sharding>` on the
  ``last_name`` field,
- ``5`` initial chunks, and
- a collation of ``simple``. 

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.shardCollection(
     "phonebook.contacts",
     { last_name: "hashed" },
     false,
     {
       numInitialChunks: 5,
       collation: { locale: "simple" }
     }
   )
