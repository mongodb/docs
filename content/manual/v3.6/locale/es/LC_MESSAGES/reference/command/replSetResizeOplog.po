"Use the :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` administrative command to change "

"Changing the oplog size of a given replica set member with "

"Reducing the oplog size does *not* reclaim that disk space automatically."
" You must run :dbcommand:`compact` against the ``oplog.rs`` collection in"
" the ``local`` database. ``compact`` blocks all operations on the "
"database it runs against. Running ``compact`` against ``oplog.rs`` "
