msgid "Initializes and returns a new :method:`Bulk()` operations builder for a collection. The builder constructs an *unordered* list of write operations that MongoDB executes in bulk."

msgid "With an *unordered* operations list, MongoDB can execute in parallel the write operations in the list and in any order. If the order of operations matter, use :method:`db.collection.initializeOrderedBulkOp()` instead."

msgid "Execution of Operations"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/includes/fact-bulk-operation-unordered-list.rst:1
msgid "When executing an :method:`unordered <db.collection.initializeUnorderedBulkOp()>` list of operations, MongoDB groups the operations. With an unordered bulk operation, the operations in the list may be reordered to increase performance. As such, applications should not depend on the ordering when performing :method:`unordered <db.collection.initializeUnorderedBulkOp()>` bulk operations."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/includes/fact-bulk-operation-batches.rst:1
msgid "Each group of operations can have at most :limit:`1000 operations <Write Command Operation Limit Size>`. If a group exceeds this :limit:`limit <Write Command Operation Limit Size>`, MongoDB will divide the group into smaller groups of 1000 or less. For example, if the bulk operations list consists of 2000 insert operations, MongoDB creates 2 groups, each with 1000 operations."
