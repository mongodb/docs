      Renamed ``--sampleRefreshIntervalSecs`` to
      ``--schemaRefreshIntervalSecs``
   
   The interval in seconds at which :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` re-samples
   data to create its schema. The default value is ``0``, which means
   that after the initial sampling no automatic re-sampling occurs. The
   specified value must be a positive integer.
