.. versionchanged:: realm@12.0.0 Deprecated in favor of Realm Logger

.. warning::

   This page shows how to set a Sync client log level in Realm React Native SDK
   versions 11.10.2 and earlier. Realm React Native SDK v12.0.0 supersedes this 
   logging implementation with a Realm logger you can set and configure
   for your application. For information on how to set a Realm logger in a later 
   version, refer to :ref:`react-native-logging`.

You can set the realm Sync client :js-sdk:`log level
<Realm.App.Sync.html#~LogLevel>` by calling
:js-sdk:`Realm.App.Sync.setLogLevel() <Realm.App.Sync.html#.setLogLevel>` with
your :js-sdk:`Realm.App <Realm.App.html>`.

.. example::

   In the following example, an application developer sets the sync client
   log level to ``"debug"``.
