Deleting a mapping rule removes the mapping rule from your project. 
Deleting a mapping rule does not remove existing collections from your 
MongoDB cluster.

To remove a collection from your cluster:

- Delete the mapping rule in Relational Migrator. This avoids the collection 
  being recreated by the next migration job.

- Manually delete the MongoDB collection. This removes the collection from your 
  cluster.

About this Task
---------------

Deleting a parent mapping rule also deletes any child mapping rules.

For example, if you delete a :guilabel:`New Documents` rule that defines a 
collection and a :guilabel:`Array in Parent` rule for the same collection, the 
:guilabel:`Array in Parent` rule is also deleted.

Steps
-----

1. Open a project.

#. In the left :guilabel:`Schema model` pane, click the table or collection
   for the mapping you want to delete. 
   
   This prompts the :guilabel:`Mappings` pane to open on the right of the screen.

#. On the :guilabel:`Mappings` pane, click the :guilabel:`Trash Can` icon.

#. Click :guilabel:`Delete` to confirm.
