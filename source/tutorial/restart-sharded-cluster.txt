The tutorial is specific to MongoDB |version|. For earlier versions of
MongoDB, refer to the corresponding version of the MongoDB Manual.

This procedure demonstrates the shutdown and startup sequence for restarting
a sharded cluster. Stopping or starting the components of a sharded cluster
in a different order may cause communication errors between members. For
example, :doc:`shard </core/sharded-cluster-shards>` servers may appear to hang
if there are no :doc:`config servers </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>`
available.

.. important:: This procedure should only be performed during a planned
   maintenance period. During this period, applications should stop
   all reads and writes to the cluster in order to prevent potential
   data loss or reading stale data.

.. _shutdown-sharded-cluster:

Disable the Balancer
--------------------

Disable the balancer to stop :doc:`chunk migration
</core/sharding-balancer-administration>` and do not perform any metadata
write operations until the process finishes. If a migration is in
progress, the balancer will complete the in-progress migration before
stopping.

To disable the balancer, connect to one of the cluster's
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances and issue the following command: 

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.stopBalancer()

To check the balancer state, issue the :method:`sh.getBalancerState()`
command.

For more information, see :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily`.

Stop Sharded Cluster
--------------------

.. _start-sharded-cluster:

Start Sharded Cluster
---------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/start-sharded-cluster.rst

Re-Enable the Balancer
----------------------

Re-enable the balancer to resume
:doc:`chunk migrations </core/sharding-balancer-administration>`.

Connect to one of the cluster's :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances and run
the :method:`sh.startBalancer()` command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.startBalancer()

To check the balancer state, issue the :method:`sh.getBalancerState()`
command.

For more information, see :ref:`sharding-balancing-enable`.

Validate Cluster Accessibility
------------------------------

Connect a :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell to one of the cluster's
:binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` processes. Use :method:`sh.status()`
to check the overall cluster status.

To confirm that all shards are accessible and communicating, insert
test data into a temporary sharded collection. Confirm that data is
being split and migrated between each shard in your cluster. You can
connect a :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell to each shard primary and
use :method:`db.collection.find()` to validate that the data was
sharded as expected.

.. important:: To prevent potential data loss or reading stale data,
   do not start application reads and writes to the cluster
   until after confirming the cluster is healthy and accessible.
