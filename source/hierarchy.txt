Organizations, projects, and {+clusters+} are the building blocks
of your {+service+} enterprise estate: 

- At the organization level, you can implement security controls and
  create users that work across one or more projects. 
- Projects offer a more fine-grained security isolation and
  authorization boundary.
- {+Clusters+} are your cloud databases in {+service+}.

Use the foundational guidance on this page to plan the hierarchy and
size for your organizations, projects, and {+clusters+}. This guidance
helps you optimize your security and performance from the start while
aligning with your enterprise's billing and access needs.

{+service+} Features and Recommendations for Hierarchy
------------------------------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

You can use the following levels of hierarchy to define
security settings and governance for your {+service+} enterprise estate:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40

   * - {+service+} Hierarchy Level
     - Description

   * - (Optional) Paying Organization
     - One organization can be a paying organization for other
       organization(s). The MongoDB account team must enable the paying organization when you establish the |service| subscription. A paying organization lets you set up :atlas:`cross-organization billing <billing/#std-label-cross-org-billing>` to share a
       billing subscription across multiple organizations.

   * - Organization
     - Invoicing aggregates and generates at the organization level.
       Line items go to cluster level and below. An organization often
       maps to a {+BU+} or application.

   * - Project
     - Security configuration for the data plane (including database
       clusters, network security, and other data services) occurs at the project level. A project often maps to an application and environment (for example: Customer Portal app -
       Production environment). For each project, there is one dedicated VPC created in GCP, and one VPC/VNet per region in AWS
       and Azure. 

   * - {+Cluster+}
     - |service| provisions each {+cluster+} within the dedicated 
       VPC/VNet(s) for a project. The security configuration is shared
       among {+clusters+} in the project, except for user roles and authorization, which you can apply to actions on a {+cluster+},
       database, and collection level.

Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Development, Testing, Staging, and Production Environments
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

We recommend that you use the following four environments to isolate
your sandbox and test projects and {+clusters+} from your application
projects and {+clusters+}:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85

   * - Environment
     - Description

   * - Development (Dev)
     - Allow developers to freely try new things in a safe sandbox
       environment.

   * - Testing (Test)
     - Test specific components or functions created in the dev
       environment.
     
   * - Staging
     - Stage all components and
       functions together to make sure the entire application works 
       as expected before deploying to production. Staging is similar to
       the test environment, but ensures that new components work well 
       with existing components.
    
   * - Production (Prod)
     - The back end for your application that is live for your
       end users.

For your dev and test environments, you can develop {+service+}
{+clusters+} locally with the {+atlas-cli+}. To learn more, see 
:atlascli:`Create a Local {+service+} Deployment
<atlas-cli-deploy-local>`.

Org and Project Hierarchies
````````````````````````````

.. _project-hierarchy-1:

Recommended Hierarchy 1: Fewer Atlas Organizations
##################################################

Consider the following hierarchy for an example enterprise.
This hierarchy, which creates fewer |service| organizations, might be useful if you have common teams and permissions across the {+BU+}, and less than the raiseable limit of 250 projects per organization. 

**DIAGRAM TO REPLACE TEXT**

- Atlas Paying Org - Acme Inc

  - Atlas Org: Consumer Products Business Unit

    - Project: Consumer Customer Portal - Production (environment) 
    - Project: Consumer Customer Portal - Test 
    - Project: Consumer Customer Portal - Dev 
    - Project: Product Mgmt App - Production 
    - Project: Product Mgmt App - Test 
    - Project: Product Mgmt App - Dev 

  - Atlas Org: Corporate Products {+BU+}

.. _project-hierarchy-2:

Recommended Hierarchy 2: More Atlas Organizations
#################################################

Consider the following hierarchy for a different enterprise.
This hierarchy creates a relatively large number of |service|
organizations: one per application or scrum team. This hierarchy might
be useful if each of your teams is fairly independent, they don't share people or permissions within a {+BU+}, or they want to buy credits themselves through the cloud provider marketplace. There is
no paying organization in this hierarchy.

**DIAGRAM TO REPLACE TEXT**

- Atlas Org: Consumer Customer Portal - paying at this level too

  - Project: Portal - Production (environment)
  - Project: Portal - Test
  - Project: Portal - Dev 

- Atlas Org: Product Mgmt App - paying at this level too

  - Project: PM App - Production 
  - Project: PM App - Test 
  - Project: PM App - Dev

.. _deployment-hierarchy:

{+Cluster+} Hierarchy
`````````````````````

To allow fine-grained access control, we recommend one deployment
per |service| project.

DIAGRAM

Grouping multiple deployments in one project by team simplifies
administration when the same team is responsible for all stages of
development, acceptance testing, and production. However, this
increases the risk of human error, since DevOps members also have
access to production {+clusters+}.

DIAGRAM

Grouping multiple deployments in one project by environment simplifies
administration when a separate team is responsible for each stage of
development, acceptance testing, and production. It allows Dev and UAT
hosts to support multiple nodes when testing shard-level operations like adding shards, and testing new zone rules. However, there is a
risk of human error because the same DevOps teams can access multiple
sub-organizations' databases.

DIAGRAM

{+Cluster+} Tagging
```````````````````

We recommend that you tag {+clusters+} with the following details to
enable easy data parsing for reports:

- {+BU+}
- Team name
- Application name
- Environment
- Version
- Email contact

To learn more about parsing billing data using tags, see
:ref:`arch-center-billing-data`.

.. _arch-center-cluster-size-guide:

{+service+} {+Cluster+} Size Guide
``````````````````````````````````

Use the following {+cluster+} size guide to select a {+cluster+} tier that ensures performance without over-provisioning. The {+cluster+} size guide also provides recommendations on which {+cluster+} tiers
are suitable for development and testing environments, and which are
suitable for staging and production environments.

The {+cluster+}
size guide uses "t-shirt sizing," a common analogy used in software
development and infrastructure to describe capacity planning in a
simplified manner. You should consider t-shirt sizes as approximate
starting points. Sizing a {+cluster+} is an iterative process based on
changing resource needs, performance requirements, workload
characteristics, and growth expectations.

.. important::
   
   This guidance excludes mission-critical applications, high-memory
   workloads, and high-CPU workloads. For mission-critical
   applications, high-memory workloads, and high-CPU workloads, contact
   |mdb-support| for customized guidance.
