|charts| provides general customization options which modify the
visualization at a high level, rather than individual pieces of the
visualization.

.. note::
  
   This page illustrates the general customization options which are
   available for most :ref:`chart types <chart-type-reference>`. Some
   chart types have other customization options which are noted on their
   individual documentation pages.

To access the general customization options, expand the :guilabel:`General`
section of the :guilabel:`Customize` tab.

Color Palette Customization
---------------------------

Palette customization allows you to select custom colors for your
chart. To enable color customization, select the
:guilabel:`Customize` tab of the :guilabel:`Chart Type` column.
A toggle switch labeled :guilabel:`Custom Color Palette` appears in
the :guilabel:`General` section. 

You can also customize individual colors in your palette. Most chart types
use a custom color picker with color swatches that correspond to your data
series.

Depending on the chart type, each color swatch has a corresponding 
number or a corresponding name:

- Single-series charts or multi-series charts created
  :ref:`using the Series method<charts-series-encoding>`
  have numbered color swatches.
- Multi-series charts created by
  :ref:`mapping multiple fields<multiple-field-mappings>` 
  have color swatches with the names of your selected fields.

To change the color of the corresponding data series, click the color swatch. 
You can select a new color with a color slider, by
entering a hex value, by entering RGB values, or by choosing a
predefined color. You can also drag and drop numbered color swatches to
rearrange the colors in your palette.

.. note::

   By default, the custom color picker shows color swatches for 10
   data series, but you can only modify as many of the swatches as
   you have data series. The palette can expand to show 20 data series. 
   Charts will use as many colors as needed to show your chart,
   starting from the first color. For example, if you have only two
   data series in your chart, only the colors numbered ``1`` and
   ``2`` have any effect on your chart.

Other chart types use a gradient color scale with a 
set of pre-defined gradients. The 
:ref:`heatmap <heatmap-chart-ref>` and :ref:`colored bar
and column <column-bar-chart-ref>` types use this method.

To close the color customization tool, click somewhere outside it.
To revert the entire chart to its default colors, set the
:guilabel:`Custom Color Palette` toggle switch back to :guilabel:`Off`.
