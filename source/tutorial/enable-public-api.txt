=====================
Enable the Public API
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You enable the |mms| Public API on a per-group basis. To enable the Public
API for a group, you must have the :ref:`Owner <owner-role>` or
:ref:`Global Owner <global-owner-role>` role.

Considerations
--------------

You can have up to ten keys associated to your account. Each key can be
either enabled or disabled, but be aware that they both count towards the
ten key limit.

API Keys are associated to a user and therefore have the same level of
access as that user.

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-public-api.rst

Additional Information
----------------------

See the :doc:`/core/api` for a background on the use and operation of the |mms|
Public API, and :doc:`/reference/api` for a complete reference of all
resources available in the |mms| Public API.
