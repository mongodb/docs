   * - Concept
     - Description
  
   * - {+df+}
     - {+df+} is a strategy that separates compute from storage. When
       you use {+df+}, you associate data from multiple physical sources
       into a single virtual source of data for your applications. This
       enables you to query your data from a single endpoint without
       physically copying or moving it.
  
   * - {+FDI+}
     - A {+fdi+} is a deployment of {+adf+}. Each {+fdi+} contains
       virtual databases and collections that map to data in your
       data stores.
  
   * - Virtual Database
     - A virtual database is a grouping of collections that organizes
       your data into a single virtual location.
  
   * - Virtual Collection
     - A virtual collection is a grouping of MongoDB
       :term:`documents <document>`, similar to a table in a relational
       database, within a single virtual database. Collections
       don't require a fixed schema.
  
   * - Data Store
     - A data store refers to the location of your data. {+adf+} supports
       the following data stores:

       - |service| {+cluster+}
       - |service| :ref:`online archive <online-archive-overview>`
       - |aws| |s3| buckets
       - {+az-bs+}
       - {+gcp+} Storage
       - |http| and |https| endpoints
  
       A {+fdi+} is limited to **one instance** of |aws| |s3|,
       {+az-bs+}, and {+gcp+} Storage at the same time. Similarly,
       {+df+} across |service| projects is unavailable. To learn more,
       see :ref:`df-limitations`.
  
   * - Storage Configuration
     - Storage configuration contains mappings between your virtual
       databases, collections, and data stores. You can define these
       mappings to access and run queries against your data.
