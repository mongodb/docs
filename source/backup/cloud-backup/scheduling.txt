|service| provides both automated and on-demand backup options. 
|service| allows you to:

- :ref:`View and modify backup policies <configure-backup-policy>`
- :ref:`Manage your backup snapshots <snapshot-management>`
- :ref:`Automate distribution of snapshots across regions <snapshot-distribution>`

If you have strict data protection requirements, you 
can enable a {+bcp+} to protect your backup data. If you have a {+bcp+} 
enabled, |service| prohibits certain actions. To 
learn more, see :ref:`backup-compliance-policy`.
