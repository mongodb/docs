:binary:`~bin.mongosh` provides the equivalent helper method
:method:`db.collection.drop()`.

Behavior
--------

- Starting in MongoDB 5.0, the :dbcommand:`drop` command and the
  :method:`db.collection.drop()` method will raise an error if passed an
  unrecognized parameter.

- This command also removes any indexes associated with the dropped
  collection.

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-drop-in-progress-indexes.rst

- The :dbcommand:`drop` command and its helper
  :method:`db.collection.drop()` create an :ref:`change-event-invalidate`
  for any :doc:`/changeStreams` opened on the dropped collection.
