Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: compact

   Rewrites and defragments all data and indexes in a collection. On
   :ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>` databases, this command will release
   unneeded disk space to the operating system.

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      { 
        compact: <collection name> 
      }
   )

Command Fields
--------------

The command takes the following fields:

.. note:: Starting in MongoDB 4.2


   MongoDB removes the MMAPv1 storage engine and the MMAPv1 specific
   options ``paddingFactor``, ``paddingBytes``, ``preservePadding``
   for :dbcommand:`compact`.


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``compact``
     - string
     - The name of the collection.

   * - ``force``
     - flag
     - .. versionchanged:: 4.4 
    
       .. _compact-force-option:

       Optional. Starting in v4.4, if specified, forces 
       :dbcommand:`compact` to run on the :term:`primary` in 
       a :term:`replica set`. Before v4.4, this boolean field 
       enabled :dbcommand:`compact` to run on the :term:`primary` 
       in a :term:`replica set` if the value was ``true`` and 
       returned an error when run on a :term:`primary` if the 
       value was ``false``, because the command blocked all other 
       operations.
      
       Starting in v4.4, :dbcommand:`compact` does not block 
       :ref:`crud` on the database it is compacting. 
      
   * - ``comment``
     - any
     - .. include:: /includes/extracts/comment-content.rst

.. warning:: Always have an up-to-date backup before performing server
   maintenance such as the :dbcommand:`compact` operation.

.. _compact-authentication:

``compact`` Required Privileges
-------------------------------

For clusters enforcing :ref:`authentication <authentication>`,
you must authenticate as a user with the :authaction:`compact` privilege
action on the target collection. The :authrole:`dbAdmin` role provides 
the required privileges for running :dbcommand:`compact` against
non-system collections. 

For more information on configuring the ``resource`` document, see 
:ref:`resource-document`.

To add the :authrole:`dbAdmin` or the custom role to an existing
user, use :method:`db.grantRolesToUser` or :method:`db.updateUser()`.
The following operation grants the custom ``compact`` role to the 
``myCompactUser`` on the ``admin`` database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use admin
   db.grantRolesToUser("myCompactUser", [ "dbAdmin" | "myCustomCompactRole" ] )

To add the :authrole:`dbAdmin` or the custom role to a new user,
specify the role to the ``roles`` array of the
:method:`db.createUser()` method when creating the user.

.. code-block:: javascript

   use admin
   db.createUser(
     { 
        user: "myCompactUser",
        pwd: "myCompactUserPassword",
        roles: [
          { role: "dbAdmin", db: "<database>" } | "myCustomCompactRole"
        ]
      }
   )

Behavior
--------

Blocking
~~~~~~~~

Blocking behavior is version specific. 

.. list-table::

   * - Version
     - Blocking Behavior

   * - Pre 4.4
     - ``compact`` blocks all read and write activity.

   * - 4.4
     - - .. include:: /includes/reference/compact-methods-list.rst
       - All other operations are permitted.

   * - Post 4.4.17, 5.0.12, 6.0.2
     - - .. include:: /includes/reference/compact-methods-list.rst
       - All other operations are permitted.
       - The :ref:`locking order <faq-concurrency-locking>` changes.

To run ``compact`` in a replica set, see
:ref:`compact-cmd-replica-sets` for additional considerations.

Monitoring Progress
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To check the ``compact`` operation's progress, monitor the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` log file or run :method:`db.currentOp()`
from another shell instance.

Operation Termination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you terminate the operation with the :method:`db.killOp()
<db.killOp()>` method or restart the server before the
:dbcommand:`compact` operation has finished, be aware of the following:

- If you have journaling enabled, the data remains valid and
  usable, regardless of the state of the :dbcommand:`compact` operation.
  You may have to manually rebuild the indexes.

- If you do not have journaling enabled and the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
  :dbcommand:`compact` terminates during the operation, it is impossible
  to guarantee that the data is in a valid state.

- In either case, much of the existing free space in the collection may
  become un-reusable. In this scenario, you should rerun the compaction
  to completion to restore the use of this free space.

Disk Space
~~~~~~~~~~

To see how the storage space changes for the collection, run the
:dbcommand:`collStats` command before and after compaction.

On :ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>`, :dbcommand:`compact` attempts
to reduce the required storage space for data and indexes in a
collection, releasing unneeded disk space to the operating system. The
effectiveness of this operation is workload dependent and no disk space
may be recovered. This command is useful if you have removed a large
amount of data from the collection, and do not plan to replace it.

:dbcommand:`compact` may require additional disk space to run on
WiredTiger databases.

.. _compact-cmd-replica-sets:

Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use ``compact`` on collections and indexes that are stored in a
replica set, however there are some important considerations:

- The primary node does not replicate the ``compact`` command to the
  secondaries.
- The ``compact`` command blocks writes while it runs.
- You should run ``compact`` on secondary nodes whenever possible. If
  you cannot run ``compact`` on secondaries, see the :ref:`force 
  <compact-force-option>` option.
- Starting in MongoDB 6.0.2 (and 5.0.12, and 4.4.17):

  - A secondary node can replicate while ``compact`` is running.
  - Reads are permitted.


To run ``compact`` on a cluster

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Compact the secondary nodes.

      Run ``compact`` on one of the secondary nodes. When ``compact``
      finishes, repeat the operation on each of the remaining
      secondaries in turn.

   .. step:: Reassign the primary node.
    
      To step down the current primary and trigger an election, use the
      :method:`rs.stepDown()` method. To nominate a particular secondary
      node, :ref:`adjust the member priority
      <replica-set-adjust-priority>`.

   .. step:: Compact the old primary.

      After stepping down, the old primary node becomes a secondary
      node. Run ``compact`` on the old primary node.

Version Specific Considerations for Secondary Nodes
```````````````````````````````````````````````````

Blocking behavior on secondary nodes is version specific.

.. list-table::

   * - Version
     - Blocking Behavior

   * - Pre 4.4
     - - ``compact`` blocks all read and write activity.
       - No replication possible.
       - Secondary node is in :replstate:`RECOVERING` state.

   * - 4.4
     - - ``compact`` blocks all write activity.
       - No replication possible.
       - Reads not permitted.

   * - Post 4.4.17, 5.0.12, 6.0.2
     - - ``compact`` blocks all write activity.
       - A secondary node can replicate while ``compact`` is running.
       - Reads permitted.  

When ``compact`` completes, the secondary returns to the
:replstate:`SECONDARY` state.

For more information about replica set member states, see
See :ref:`replica-set-member-states`.

For replica set maintenance and availability, see
:ref:`perform-maint-on-replica-set`.

Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`compact` only applies to :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances. In a
sharded environment, run :dbcommand:`compact` on each shard separately
as a maintenance operation.

You cannot issue :dbcommand:`compact` against a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

Capped Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On :ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>`, the :dbcommand:`compact`
command will attempt to compact the collection.

Index Building
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:binary:`~bin.mongod` rebuilds all indexes in parallel following the
:dbcommand:`compact` operation.
