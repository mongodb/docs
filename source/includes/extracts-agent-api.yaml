   With the new Agent API Key model, multiple Agent API Keys can be
   associated with a group. This gives users the ability to perform
   Agent key rotation.

   In addition, the new Agent API Key model improves on security as the
   keys are displayed only once upon creation and |mms|  no longer
   stores or displays these keys.

   Previous Agent API Key model associated a single Agent API Key with
   a group and is displayed in the :guilabel:`Group Settings` page
   (:guilabel:`Settings` > :guilabel:`Group Settings`).

   You can use an Agent API key that you have already generated for the
   group. Otherwise, you can generate a new Agent API key. A group can
   have more than one Agent API key, and any of the group's agents can
   use any of the keys. For more information, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/manage-agent-api-key`.

   To generate an Agent API key, go to the :guilabel:`Agent API Keys`
   tab. To navigate to the tab, from the :guilabel:`Deployment` view,
   click the :guilabel:`Agents` tab and then the :guilabel:`Agent API
   Keys` tab.

   .. important::

      When you generate an Agent API key, |mms| displays it **one time
      only**. You must copy it and store it in a secure place. |mms| will never
      display the full key again.
