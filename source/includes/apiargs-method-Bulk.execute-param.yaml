  :doc:`Write concern </reference/write-concern>` document for the bulk
  operation as a whole. Omit to use default. For a standalone
  :program:`mongod` server, the write concern defaults to ``{ w: 1 }``.
  With a replica set, the default write concern is ``{ w: 1 }`` unless
  modified as part of the :ref:`replica set configuration
  <repl-set-modify-default-write-concern>`.

  See :ref:`bulk-execute-ex-write-concern` for an example.
