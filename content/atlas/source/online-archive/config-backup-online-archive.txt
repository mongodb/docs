Back Up Online Archive Data
===========================

After you archive data, it is not covered by the backup 
configuration on your live |service| cluster. However, archived data 
has the same redundancy guarantees that the |s3| vendor provides. If 
you have :ref:`configured online archive <config-online-archive>` on 
your |service| cluster, use :ref:`pit-restore` to mitigate data loss 
and have an easy restore process.

Consider the following scenarios:

- You archived part of your collection data and then backed up the 
  remaining data on your |service| cluster. If your cluster goes down 
  when data exists in your cluster and in your Online Archive, you can 
  restore your cluster data to the last state preserved in your backup 
  strategy, and your Online Archive will remain unchanged. 
- You backed up data on your |service| cluster and then archived part 
  of your collection data. If your cluster goes down and you need to 
  restore from a backup that is older than the time when archiving was 
  stopped for the data, you may restore documents to your cluster that 
  already exist in your Online Archive. 
  
If you use :ref:`pit-restore`, you can replay the :manual:`oplog 
</reference/glossary/#term-oplog>` to restore your cluster to a point 
in time that matches the last time documents on the cluster were 
archived and avoid any data loss or data redundancy.

If you have configured :ref:`pit-restore` and :ref:`online archive 
<config-online-archive>` on your |service| cluster, do the following 
to restore your cluster if your cluster goes down:

1. :ref:`Pause <pause-resume-online-archive>` online archive.

#. :ref:`Restore <restore-from-continuous>` your cluster 
   from the :ref:`pit-restore`.

#. :ref:`Resume <pause-resume-online-archive>` online archive.
