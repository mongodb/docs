   Effective Wednesday, June 16th, 2021, New Relic no longer supports 
   the plugin-based integration with MongoDB. We do not recommend 
   that you sign up for the plugin-based integration. To learn more, 
   see the `New Relic Plugin EOL Statement <https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/new-relic-plugin-eol-wednesday-june-16th-2021/127267>`__. As 
   an alternative, consider New Relic's `MongoDB monitoring integration 
   <https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/mongodb-monitoring-integration/>`__.
