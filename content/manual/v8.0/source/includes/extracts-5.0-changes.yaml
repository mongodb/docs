   Starting in MongoDB 5.0, the :dbcommand:`drop` command and the
   :method:`db.collection.drop()` method return an error if you try to
   drop a collection in the :term:`admin database` or the
   :term:`config database` from a :binary:`~bin.mongos`. To drop these
   collections, connect to the :ref:`config server
   <sharded-cluster-config-server>` and run the command there.

   .. warning::

      Dropping collections in the :term:`admin database` or the
      :term:`config database` can leave your cluster in an unusable
      state.

   password. You can also specify your password directly as a string. We
   recommend to use the :method:`passwordPrompt()` method to avoid the
   password being visible on your screen and potentially leaking the
   password to your shell history.
