Description
-----------

``Query Targeting`` alerts indicate inefficient query or queries. 

:alert:`Query Targeting: Scanned / Returned` occurs if the number of
documents examined to fulfill a query relative to the actual number of
returned documents meets or is above a certain threshold.

:alert:`Query Targeting: Scanned Objects / Returned` occurs if the
number of index keys examined to fulfill a query relative to the actual
number of returned documents meets or is above a certain threshold.

Common Triggers
---------------

- No index that supports a given query or queries.

- Existing index can only partially support a query or queries.

Possible Solution
-----------------

Consider adding one more more indexes to better serve these queries.
