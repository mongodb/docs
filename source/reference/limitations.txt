The following limits apply to |service|.

.. _atlas-limitations:

|service| Limits
----------------

|service| limits the number of the following items:

- Components of particular type that you can create.
- Connections allowed to a {+database-deployment+}. For
  {+clusters+}, the number of connections allowed depends on the
  {+cluster+} tier.
- |global-write-cluster| shard keys per :ref:`project <projects>`. Each
  |service| project supports up to 40 |global-write-cluster| shard keys.
  If you require multiple |global-write-clusters| and might exceed
  this limit, deploy each additional |global-write-cluster| in a
  separate project.
  
To learn more, see :ref:`atlas-limits`. For questions or assistance, contact :doc:`support </support/>`:

{+Serverless-Instance+} Limits
------------------------------

{+Serverless-instances+} don't currently 
support all of the available |service| features. MongoDB plans to 
add support for more configurations and capabilities on 
{+Serverless-instances+} over time. To learn more, see 
:ref:`serverless-instance-limitations`.

|service| M0 ({+Free-Cluster+}), M2, and M5 Limits
-------------------------------------------------------

{+Free-clusters+} have certain :ref:`configuration limits 
<shared-limits-config>`, :ref:`operational limits 
<shared-limits-ops>`, and :ref:`driver requirements 
<shared-limits-drivers>`. To learn more, see :ref:`atlas-free-tier`.

Unsupported Commands in |service|
---------------------------------

Some commands have :ref:`limits on {+Free-clusters+} 
<free-shard-commands-with-limits>`, or are :ref:`unsupported on 
{+Free-clusters+} <free-shard-unsupported-commands>`. Some commands 
have :ref:`limits on M10+ {+clusters+} <limited-commands-paid>`, 
or are :ref:`unsupported on M10+ {+clusters+} 
<unsupported-commands-paid>`. Also, some commands are 
:ref:`unsupported on {+Serverless-instances+} 
<atlas-serverless-command-limitations>`. To learn more, see 
:ref:`unsupported-commands`.

Commands Available Only in {+Free-Clusters+}
--------------------------------------------

|service| supports some commands only on {+Free-clusters+}. To learn 
more, see :ref:`free-tier-commands`.
