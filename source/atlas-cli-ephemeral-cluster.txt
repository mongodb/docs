This tutorial demonstrates how to quickly create and delete ephemeral 
|service| projects and {+clusters+} using the {+atlas-cli+}. Ephemeral
projects and {+clusters+} provide temporary testing environments that
you isolate from your production projects and {+clusters+}. You can use
ephemeral projects and {+clusters+} to test your automation scripts
before using the scripts on production {+clusters+}.

.. _atlas-cli-ephemeral-reqs:

Prerequisites 
-------------

Before you begin, complete the following tasks: 

- Create an |service| user account.
- :ref:`Create <atlas-organizations-create>` an 
  :atlas:`Atlas organization </organizations-projects/>` and
  note its organization ID. You can find the organization ID by running the :ref:`atlas-organizations-list` command.
- :ref:`install-atlas-cli`.
- :ref:`connect-atlas-cli`.

Follow These Steps
------------------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Create the ephemeral project, {+cluster+}, and database user.

      a. Run the :ref:`atlas-users-describe` command to find your 
         |service| user ID. Replace <YOUR-EMAIL> with the email address
         that is associated with your |service| user account.

         .. code-block::

            atlas users describe --username <YOUR-EMAIL>

      b. Run the :ref:`atlas-projects-create` command to create the
         ephemeral project. Replace <ORG-ID> with the organization ID
         and replace <YOUR-USER-ID> with your |service| user ID that
         you retrieved in the previous step.

         .. code-block::

            atlas projects create myEphemeralProject --orgId <ORG-ID> --ownerId <YOUR-USER-ID>

      c. Retrieve the project ID for the ephemeral project you created
         from the response. In the following example response, the
         project ID is ``64933bde48add154124e343f``.

         .. code-block::

            Project '64933bde48add154124e343f' created.

         Alternatively, you can use the :ref:`atlas-projects-list`
         command to find the project ID.

      d. Run the :ref:`atlas-setup` command to create an ``M10``
         {+cluster+} and a database user. Replace <YOUR-PASSWORD> with a password for the database user and replace <PROJECT-ID> with
         the project ID for the ephemeral project you created.

         .. code-block::

            atlas setup --clusterName myEphemeralCluster --provider AWS --region US_EAST_1 --tier M10 --username myEphemeralUser --password <YOUR-PASSWORD> --currentIp --skipSampleData --projectId <PROJECT-ID> --force

         After |service| creates the {+cluster+}, the {+atlas-cli+}
         provides the :manual:`connection string 
         </reference/connection-string/#connection-string-options>` and
         connects to your {+cluster+} through {+mongosh+}.

   .. step:: Test your automations on the ephemeral project and {+cluster+}.

   .. step:: Delete the ephemeral project, {+cluster+}, and database user.

      a. Run the :ref:`atlas-clusters-delete` command to delete the
         ephemeral {+cluster+} and its database users. Replace <PROJECT-ID> with the project ID for your ephemeral project.

         .. code-block::

            atlas clusters delete myEphemeralCluster --projectId <PROJECT-ID> --force

      b. Run the :ref:`atlas-projects-delete` command to delete the
         ephemeral project. Replace <PROJECT-ID> with the project ID
         for your ephemeral project.

         .. code-block::

            atlas projects delete <PROJECT-ID> --force

         .. note::

            You can't delete the ephemeral project until the ephemeral
            {+cluster+} finishes shutting down. If you get an error
            stating ``CANNOT_CLOSE_GROUP_ACTIVE_ATLAS_CLUSTERS``, wait
            five minutes, then run the ``atlas projects delete``
            command again.

      You can run the :ref:`atlas-projects-list` command to confirm
      successful deletion of the ephemeral project and {+cluster+}. If
      the ephemeral project is missing from the list, you successfully
      deleted both the project and the {+cluster+}.
