Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use a **change stream** to monitor real-time
changes to your database. A change stream is a {+mdb-server+} feature that
allows your application to subscribe to data changes on a collection, database,
or deployment.

When using the {+driver-short+}, you can instantiate a ``mongocxx::change_stream`` to
monitor data changes.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection in the ``sample_restaurants``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To access this collection
from your C++ application, instantiate a ``mongocxx::client`` that connects to an Atlas cluster
and assign the following values to your ``db`` and ``collection`` variables:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-db-coll
    :end-before: end-db-coll

To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

Open a Change Stream
--------------------

To open a change stream, call the ``watch()`` method. The instance on which you
call the ``watch()`` method on determines the scope of events that the change
stream listens for. You can call the ``watch()`` method on the following
classes:

- ``mongocxx::client``: Monitor all changes in the MongoDB deployment
- ``mongocxx::database``: Monitor changes in all collections in the database
- ``mongocxx::collection``: Monitor changes in the collection

The following example opens a change stream on the ``restaurants`` collection
and outputs changes as they occur:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.cpp
   :start-after: start-open-change-stream
   :end-before: end-open-change-stream
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:

To begin watching for changes, run the preceding code. Then, in a separate
application or shell, modify the ``restaurants`` collection. The following
example updates a document that has a ``name`` field value of ``Blarney Castle``:

.. _cpp-change-stream-update:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.cpp
   :start-after: start-update-for-change-stream
   :end-before: end-update-for-change-stream
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:

When you update the collection, the change stream application prints the change
as it occurs. The printed change event resembles the following output:

.. code-block:: bash
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : { "_data" : "..." }, "operationType" : "update", "clusterTime" : 
   { "$timestamp" : { ... }, "wallTime" : { "$date" : ... }, "ns" : 
   { "db" : "sample_restaurants", "coll" : "restaurants" }, "documentKey" : 
   { "_id" : { "$oid" : "..." } }, "updateDescription" : { "updatedFields" :
   { "cuisine" : "Irish" }, "removedFields" : [  ], "truncatedArrays" : [  ] } }

Modify the Change Stream Output
-------------------------------

You can pass a ``mongocxx::pipeline`` instance as an argument to the ``watch()`` method
to modify the change stream output. The following list includes some of the ``mongocxx::pipeline``
fields you can set by calling their corresponding setter methods:

- ``add_fields``: Adds new fields to documents
- ``match``: Filters the documents
- ``project``: Projects a subset of the document fields
- ``redact``: Restricts the contents of the documents
- ``group``: Groups documents by a specified expression
- ``merge``: Outputs the results to a collection

.. tip::

   For a full list of ``mongocxx::pipeline`` fields, see the `mongocxx::pipeline
   <{+api+}/classmongocxx_1_1v__noabi_1_1pipeline.html>`__ API documentation.

The following example sets the ``match`` field of a ``mongocxx::pipeline`` instance,
then passes the pipeline to the ``watch()`` method. This instructs the ``watch()`` method
to output only update operations:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.cpp
   :start-after: start-change-stream-pipeline
   :end-before: end-change-stream-pipeline
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:

Modify ``watch()`` Behavior
---------------------------

You can modify the behavior of the ``watch()`` method by passing an instance
of the ``mongocxx::options::change_stream`` class as a parameter. The following table
describes the fields you can set in a ``mongocxx::options::change_stream`` instance:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``full_document``
     - | Specifies whether to show the full document after the change, rather
         than showing only the changes made to the document. To learn more about
         this option, see :ref:`cpp-change-stream-pre-post-image`.

   * - ``full_document_before_change``
     - | Specifies whether to show the full document as it was before the change, rather
         than showing only the changes made to the document. To learn more about
         this option, see :ref:`cpp-change-stream-pre-post-image`.
    
   * - ``resume_after``
     - | Instructs ``watch()`` to resume returning changes after the
         operation specified in the resume token.
       | Each change stream event document includes a resume token as the ``_id``
         field. Pass the entire ``_id`` field of the change event document that
         represents the operation you want to resume after.
       | ``resume_after`` is mutually exclusive with ``start_after`` and ``start_at_operation_time``.

   * - ``start_after``
     - | Instructs ``watch()`` to start a new change stream after the
         operation specified in the resume token. This field allows notifications to
         resume after an invalidate event.
       | Each change stream event document includes a resume token as the ``_id``
         field. Pass the entire ``_id`` field of the change event document that
         represents the operation you want to resume after.
       | ``start_after`` is mutually exclusive with ``resume_after`` and ``start_at_operation_time``.
       
   * - ``start_at_operation_time``
     - | Instructs ``watch()`` to return only events that occur after the
         specified timestamp.
       | ``start_at_operation_time`` is mutually exclusive with ``resume_after`` and ``start_after``.

   * - ``max_await_time_ms``
     - | Sets the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, the server waits for new
         data changes to report to the change stream cursor before returning an
         empty batch. Defaults to 1000 milliseconds.

   * - ``batch_size``
     - | Sets the maximum number of change events to return in each batch of the
         response from the MongoDB cluster.

   * - ``collation``
     - | Sets the collation to use for the change stream cursor.

   * - ``comment``
     - | Attaches a comment to the operation.

.. _cpp-change-stream-pre-post-image:

Include Pre-Images and Post-Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   You can enable pre-images and post-images on collections only if your
   deployment uses MongoDB v6.0 or later.

By default, when you perform an operation on a collection, the
corresponding change event includes only the delta of the fields
modified by that operation. To see the full document before or after a
change, specify the ``full_document_before_change`` or the ``full_document``
fields of a ``mongocxx::options::change_stream`` instance.

The **pre-image** is the full version of a document *before* a change. To include the
pre-image in the change stream event, set the ``full_document_before_change``
field to one of the following strings:

- ``"whenAvailable"``: The change event includes a pre-image of the
  modified document for change events only if the pre-image is available.
- ``"required"``: The change event includes a pre-image of the
  modified document for change events. If the pre-image is not available, the
  driver raises an error.

The **post-image** is the full version of a document *after* a change. To include the
post-image in the change stream event, set the ``full_document`` field to
one of the following strings:

- ``"updateLookup"``: The change event includes a copy of the entire changed
  document from some time after the change.
- ``"whenAvailable"``: The change event includes a post-image of the
  modified document for change events only if the post-image is available.
- ``"required"``: The change event includes a post-image of the
  modified document for change events. If the post-image is not available, the
  driver raises an error.

The following example calls the ``watch()`` method on a collection and includes the post-image
of updated documents by setting the ``full_document`` field of a ``mongocxx::options::change_stream``
instance:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.cpp
   :start-after: start-change-stream-post-image
   :end-before: end-change-stream-post-image
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:

With the change stream application running, updating a document in the
``restaurants`` collection by using the :ref:`preceding update example
<cpp-change-stream-update>` prints a change event resembling the following
code:

.. code-block:: bash
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 3,4,5,6

   { "_id" : { "_data" : "..." }, "operationType" : "update", "clusterTime" :
   { "$timestamp" : { ... } }, "wallTime" : { "$date" : ... },
   "fullDocument" : { "_id" : { "$oid" : "..." }, "address" : { "building" : "202-24",
   "coord" : [ -73.925044200000002093, 40.559546199999999772 ], "street" :
   "Rockaway Point Boulevard", "zipcode" : "11697" }, "borough" : "Queens", "cuisine" :
   "Irish", "grades" : [ ... ], "name" : "Blarney Castle", "restaurant_id" : "40366356" },
   "ns" : { "db" : "sample_restaurants", "coll" : "restaurants" }, "documentKey" :
   { "_id" : { "$oid" : "..." } }, "updateDescription" : { "updatedFields" :
   { "cuisine" : "Irish" }, "removedFields" : [  ], "truncatedArrays" : [  ] } }
