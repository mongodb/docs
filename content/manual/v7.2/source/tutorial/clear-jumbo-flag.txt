If MongoDB cannot split a chunk that exceeds the :ref:`specified range
size <sharding-range-size>`, MongoDB labels the chunk as 
:ref:`jumbo <jumbo-chunks>`.

The following procedures outline the steps to manually clear the 
``jumbo`` flag.

Procedures
----------

.. _preferred-method-clear-jumbo:

Divisible Chunks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The preferred manual way to clear the ``jumbo`` flag from a chunk is to
attempt to split the chunk. If the chunk is divisible, MongoDB removes
the flag upon successful split of the chunk.

.. include:: /includes/steps/clear-jumbo-flag-preferred.rst

Indivisible Chunks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some instances, MongoDB cannot split the no-longer ``jumbo`` chunk,
such as a chunk with a range of single shard key value. As such, you
cannot split the chunk to clear the flag.

In such cases, you can either :ref:`change the shard key
<change-a-shard-key>` so that the chunk can become divisible or manually
clear the flag.

Refine the Shard Key
````````````````````

MongoDB provides the :dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command. Using the
:dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command, you can refine a
collection's shard key by adding a suffix field or fields to the
existing key. By adding new field(s) to the shard key, indivisible
jumbo chunks can become divisible.

.. _clear-jumbo-flag-manually:

Manually Clear the ``jumbo`` Flag for an Indivisible Chunk
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

You can manually clear the flag using the following steps. 

.. important::

   If you clear the ``jumbo`` flag for a chunk that still exceeds the
   chunk size, MongoDB will re-label the chunk as ``jumbo`` when
   MongoDB tries to move the chunk.

   .. tab:: MongoDB 4.2.3 and later
      :tabid: clear-flag-command

      Starting in version 4.2.3 (and 4.0.15), MongoDB provides the
      :dbcommand:`clearJumboFlag` command to manually clear the
      ``jumbo`` flag.

      .. important::

         Only use this method if the :ref:`preferred method
         <preferred-method-clear-jumbo>` is *not* applicable.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/clear-jumbo-flag-command.rst
   

   .. tab:: MongoDB 4.2.2 and earlier
      :tabid: clear-flag-manual

      For MongoDB 4.2.2 and earlier (and 4.0.14 and earlier), you must
      manually clear the ``jumbo`` flag using the following procedure.

      .. important::

         Only use this method if the :ref:`preferred method
         <preferred-method-clear-jumbo>` is *not* applicable.

         Before modifying the :doc:`config database
         </reference/config-database>`, *always* back up the config database.
