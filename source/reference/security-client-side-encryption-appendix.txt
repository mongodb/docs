``mongocryptd``
---------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/csfle-enterprise-atlas-only.rst

``mongocryptd`` is required for :ref:`automatic field level encryption
<field-level-encryption-automatic>` and is included as a component in
the :doc:`MongoDB Enterprise Server
</administration/install-enterprise>` package, or separately as the
``mongodb-enterprise-cryptd`` package. ``mongocryptd`` performs
the following:

- Parses the :ref:`automatic encryption rules
  <field-level-encryption-json-schema>` specified to the database
  connection. Automatic encryption rules use a strict subset of 
  JSON schema syntax. If the automatic encryption rules contains invalid
  automatic encryption syntax *or* any :query:`document validation
  <$jsonSchema>` syntax, ``mongocryptd`` returns an error. 

- Uses the specified automatic encryption rules to mark fields in 
  read and write operations for encryption.

- Reject read/write operations that may return unexpected or incorrect 
  results when applied to an encrypted field. See 
  :doc:`/reference/security-client-side-query-aggregation-support` for 
  more information.

``mongocryptd`` is only responsible for the above functions, and does
not perform any of the following:

- ``mongocryptd`` *does not* perform encryption or decryption itself
- ``mongocryptd`` *does not* access any encryption key material
- ``mongocryptd`` *does not* listen over the network

Drivers compatible with MongoDB 4.2 and later use the
Apache-licensed `libmongocrypt
<https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt>`__ library for performing
client-side field level encryption and automatic decryption.

The official MongoDB 4.2+ compatible drivers and the 4.2 or later
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell require access to the ``mongocryptd`` process
on the client host machine. The 4.2+ compatible drivers and 4.2 or later
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell search for the ``mongocryptd`` process in the
system PATH by default. See :ref:`mongocryptd-installation` for the
complete documentation on installing ``mongocryptd``.

Usage
~~~~~

If the 4.2+ compatible driver has access to the ``mongocryptd`` process,
by default the driver manages the spawning of the ``mongocryptd``
process. The 4.2+ compatible drivers may have additional options for
specifying the path to or the spawning behavior of the ``mongocryptd``
process.

If possible, we recommend that ``mongocryptd`` be started on boot,
rather than launched on demand.

.. _mongocryptd-installation:

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For supported :doc:`Linux Operating Systems
</administration/install-enterprise-linux>`, follow the documented
installation instructions and install the ``mongodb-enterprise`` server
package. Alternatively, specify ``mongodb-enterprise-cryptd`` instead to
install only the ``mongocryptd`` binary. The package manager installs
the binaries to a location in the system PATH (e.g. ``/usr/bin/``)

For OSX, install the 
:doc:`Server package </tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-os-x>`.
The package manager installs binaries to a location in the system
PATH.

For Windows, install the
:doc:`Server package </tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-windows>`.
You must add the ``mongocryptd`` package to your system PATH after
installation. Defer to documented best practices for your Windows
installation for instructions on adding the ``mongocryptd`` binary to
the system PATH.

For installations via an official tarball or ZIP archive,
follow the documented best practices for your operating system to add
the ``mongocryptd`` binary to your system PATH.
