Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to specify a **query** by using {+odm+}.

You can refine the set of documents that a query returns by creating a
**query filter**. A query filter is an expression that specifies the search
criteria MongoDB uses to match documents in a read or write operation.
When creating a query filter, you can prompt the driver to search for
documents with an exact match to your query, or you can compose query
filters to express more complex matching criteria.

{+odm+} provides a query domain-specific language (DSL) similar to the
one used in Active Record.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``Band`` model, which represents a
band or musical group. The definition of the ``Band`` model might be
different for each section to demonstrate different query
functionalities. Some sections might use other models
to demonstrate query functionality.

Queries in {+odm+}
------------------

{+odm+} query methods return ``Mongoid::Criteria`` objects, which are
chainable and lazily evaluated wrappers for the MongoDB Query API.
The queries are executed when you iterate through the results. The
following example demonstrates the return type for a simple query:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Creates a simple query
  Band.where(name: "Deftones")
  
  # Returns a Criteria object
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"name"=>"Deftones"}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>

  # Evaluate the query by converting to JSON
  Band.where(name: "Deftones").to_json
  
  # Returns matching documents
  # => [{"_id":"...","name":"Deftones"}]

You can use methods such as ``first`` and ``last`` to return
individual documents. You can also iterate a ``Criteria`` object by using
methods such as ``each`` or ``map`` to retrieve documents from the
server. You can use ``to_json`` to convert a ``Criteria`` object to
JSON.

.. tip:: Chaining methods

   If you chain other query methods on an existing ``Criteria`` object,
   {+odm+} merges the filter criteria.

Create a Query Filter 
---------------------

This section describes the syntax patterns that you can use to create
filter criteria. You can specify queries in {+odm+} by using any of the
following syntax patterns:

- Field syntax
- Query API syntax
- Symbol operator syntax

.. note:: Syntax Behaviors
    
   These syntaxes support querying embedded documents by using dot notation.
   The syntaxes also respect :ref:`field aliases <mongoid-query-field-alias>`
   and field types, if the field being queried is defined in the model class.

The examples in this section use the following model definition:

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
 
     field :name, type: String
     field :founded, type: Integer
     field :m, as: :member_count, type: Integer
 
     embeds_one :manager
   end
 
   class Manager
     include Mongoid::Document
 
     embedded_in :band
 
     field :name, type: String
   end

Field Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The field querying syntax uses the basic {+language+} hashes. The keys
can be symbols or strings and correspond to field names in MongoDB
documents.

The following code shows two equivalent queries that use field querying
syntax to retrieve documents in which the ``name`` field value is
``'Depeche Mode'``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-simple-field-query
   :end-before: end-simple-field-query
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

Query API Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify a Query API operator on any field by using the hash
syntax, as shown by the following equivalent queries:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-query-api-query
   :end-before: end-query-api-query
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

Symbol Operator Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify Query API operators as methods on symbols for the
respective field name, as shown in the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-symbol-query
   :end-before: end-symbol-query
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

Query on Different Field Types
------------------------------

This section describes how to perform queries on fields with different
types of values.

Defined Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To query on a field, the field does not need to be in the
the model class definition. However, if a field is defined in
the model class, {+odm+} coerces query values to match the defined field
types when constructing the query.

The following code specifies a string value when querying on the
``founded`` field. Because the ``founded`` field is defined in the model
class to have ``Integer`` values, {+odm+} coerces the string ``'2020'``
to ``2020`` when performing the query:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-defined-field-query
   :end-before: end-defined-field-query
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

To learn more about defining fields in {+odm+}, see the
:ref:`mongoid-field-types` guide.

Raw Values
~~~~~~~~~~

To bypass {+odm+}'s query type coercion behavior and query
directly for the raw-typed value in the database, wrap the query value in
the ``Mongoid::RawValue`` class, as shown in the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-raw-field-query
   :end-before: end-raw-field-query
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

.. _mongoid-query-field-alias:

Field Aliases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Queries follow the :ref:`storage field
names <mongoid-field-behaviors-storage-names>` and :ref:`field aliases
<mongoid-field-behaviors-aliases>` that you might have set in your
model class definition.

The ``id`` and ``_id`` fields are aliases, so you can use either field
name in queries:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-id-field-query
   :end-before: end-id-field-query
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

Embedded Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To query on values of fields of embedded documents, you can use dot
notation. The following code retrieves documents in which the ``name``
field of the embedded ``Manager`` document is ``'Smith'``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-embedded-query
   :end-before: end-embedded-query
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

The following code demonstrates how to use a symbol operator when
querying on an embedded field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-embedded-ne-query
   :end-before: end-embedded-ne-query
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

.. note::

   Queries always return top-level model instances, even if all the
   conditions reference embedded document fields.

.. _mongoid-query-logical-operations:

Logical Operations
------------------

{+odm+} supports the following logical operations on ``Criteria``
objects:

- ``and``
- ``or``
- ``nor``
- ``not``

These methods take one or more hashes of conditions or another
``Criteria`` object as their arguments. The ``not`` operation has an
argument-free version.

The following code demonstrates how to use the logical operations in
queries:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-logical-ops
   :end-before: end-logical-ops
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

.. note:: Array Parameters

   To ensure backwards compatibility with earlier {+odm+} versions, the
   logical operation methods accept arrays of parameters, which are
   flattened to obtain the criteria.
   
   Passing arrays to logical operations is deprecated and might be removed
   in a future version.

The following queries produce the same conditions:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-logical-and-ops
   :end-before: end-logical-and-ops
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

Operator Combinations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The logical operators have the the same semantics as those from Active
Record. 

When conditions are specified on the same field multiple times, all
conditions are added to the criteria, as shown by the queries in the
following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-logical-combination-ops
   :end-before: end-logical-combination-ops
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

The ``any_of``, ``none_of``, ``nor``, and ``not`` operations
behave similarly.

When you use ``and``, ``or``, and ``nor`` logical operators, they
operate on the criteria built up to that point:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-logical-combination-ops-2
   :end-before: end-logical-combination-ops-2
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

not Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``not`` method without arguments, in which case it
negates the next condition that is specified. The ``not`` method can
be called with one or more hash conditions or ``Criteria`` objects,
which are all negated and added to the criteria.

The following examples demonstrate the behavior of ``not``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-not-logical
   :end-before: end-not-logical
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

.. note::
   
   You cannot use the ``$not`` operator in MongoDB with a string argument.
   Mongoid uses the ``$ne`` operator to achieve negation:

   .. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
      :start-after: start-not-logical-note
      :end-before: end-not-logical-note
      :language: ruby
      :dedent:

Similarly to ``and``, the ``not`` operation negates individual
conditions for simple field criteria. For complex conditions and when a
field already has a condition defined on it, {+odm+} emulates ``$not``
by using an ``{'$and' => [{'$nor' => ...}]}`` construct, because MongoDB
supports the ``$not`` operator only on a per-field basis rather than
globally:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-not-behavior
   :end-before: end-not-behavior
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

If you are using ``not`` with arrays or regular expressions, view the
limitations of ``$not`` in the :manual:`{+server-manual+}
</reference/operator/query/not/>`.

Incremental Query Construction
------------------------------

By default, when you add conditions to a query, {+odm+} considers each
condition complete and independent from any other conditions
present in the query. For example, calling ``in`` twice adds two separate
``$in`` conditions:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-incremental-1
   :end-before: end-incremental-1
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

Some operator methods support building the condition incrementally. When
you add a condition which uses one of the supported operators, {+odm+}
sees if there already is a condition on the same field using the
same operator. If so, the operator expressions are combined according to the
specified *merge strategy*. The following section describes the available merge
strategies.

.. _mongoid-merge-strategies:

Merge Strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+odm+} provides the following merge strategies:

- **Override**: The new operator instance replaces any existing
  conditions on the same field by using the same operator.
- **Intersect**: If there already is a condition using the same operator
  on the same field, the values of the existing condition are
  intersected with the values of the new condition and the result is
  stored as the operator value.
- **Union**: If there already is a condition using the same operator on
  the same field, the values of the new condition are added to the
  values of the existing condition and the result is stored as the
  operator value.

The following code demonstrates how the merge strategies produce
criteria by using ``in`` as the example operator:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-in-merge
   :end-before: end-in-merge
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

The strategy is requested by calling ``override``, ``intersect`` or ``union``
on a ``Criteria`` instance. The requested strategy applies to the next
condition method called on the query. If the next condition method called does
not support merge strategies, the strategy is reset, as shown in the following
example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-merge-reset
   :end-before: end-merge-reset
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

Because ``ne`` does not support merge strategies, the ``union`` strategy
is ignored and reset. Then, when ``in`` is invoked the second time,
there is no active strategy.

.. warning::

   Merge strategies assume that the previous conditions have been added
   to the top level of the query. However, this is not always the case,
   as conditions might be nested under an ``$and`` clause. Using merge
   strategies with complex criteria can generate incorrect queries.

Supported Operator Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operator methods support merge strategies:

- ``all``
- ``in``
- ``nin``

The set of methods might be expanded in future releases of {+odm+}. To ensure
future compatibility, invoke a strategy method only when the next method call
is an operator that supports merge strategies.

Merge strategies are applied only when conditions are
added through the designated methods. In the following example, the
merge strategy is not applied because the second condition is added as
``where``, not by using ``in``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-merge-where
   :end-before: end-merge-where
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

Operator Value Expansion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Operator methods that support merge strategies take ``Array`` as their
value type. {+odm+} expands ``Array``-compatible types, such as a
``Range``, when they are used with these operator methods.

The following example demonstrates how you can pass a ``Range`` object
as the query value when using the ``in`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-range-query
   :end-before: end-range-query
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

{+odm+} wraps non-``Array`` values in arrays,
as the shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Band.in(year: 1950)
   # Interpreted query: {"year"=>{"$in"=>[1950]}}

Element Match
-------------

You can use the ``elem_match`` method to match documents that contain
an array field with at least one element that matches all the specified
query criteria.

The following example creates a sample document that contains an array
field. Then, it uses the  ``elem_match`` method to match documents in
which the ``tour`` array field contains an entry in which the ``city``
value is ``'London'``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-elem-match-1
   :end-before: end-elem-match-1
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

Associations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``elem_match`` method to match embedded associations.

This example uses the following models that define an embedded
association between ``Band`` and ``Tour``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-elemmatch-embedded-class
   :end-before: end-elemmatch-embedded-class
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

The following code creates a ``Band`` object and embedded ``Tour``
objects, then uses the ``elem_match`` method to query on the ``city``
field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-elemmatch-embedded-operations
   :end-before: end-elemmatch-embedded-operations
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

.. note::

   You cannot use ``elem_match`` on non-embedded associations because
   MongoDB does not perform a join operation on the collections.
   If you perform this query, the conditions are added to the collection
   that is the source of the non-embedded association rather than the
   collection of the association.

You can use ``elem_match`` to query recursively embedded associations,
as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-elemmatch-recursive
   :end-before: end-elemmatch-recursive
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

To learn more about associations, see the :ref:`mongoid-associations`
guide.

Querying by _id Value
---------------------

{+odm+} provides the ``find`` method, which allows you to query
documents by their ``_id`` values.

The following example uses the ``find`` method to match a document
with the specified ``_id`` field value:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Band.find('6725342d4cb3e161059f91d7')

.. note:: Type Conversion

   When you pass an ID value to the ``find`` method, the method
   converts it to the data type declared for the ``_id`` field in the
   model. By default, the ``_id`` field is defined as a
   ``BSON::ObjectId`` type.

   The preceding example is equivalent to the following code, which
   passes an ``BSON::ObjectId`` instance as the argument to ``find``:

   .. code-block:: ruby
      
      Band.find(BSON::ObjectId.from_string('5f0e41d92c97a64a26aabd10'))

   If you use the {+ruby-driver+} to query on the ``_id`` field,
   ``find`` does not internally perform the type conversion.

The ``find`` method accepts multiple arguments, or an array of arguments.
{+odm+} interprets each argument or array element as an
``_id`` value, and returns documents with all the specified ``_id``
values in an array, as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-id-query-multiple
   :end-before: end-id-query-multiple
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

The ``find`` method exhibits the following behavior:

- If you provide the same ``_id`` value more than once, {+odm+}
  returns only one document, if one exists.

- {+odm+} does not return documents in an ordered way. Documents might
  be returned in different order from the order of the provided ``_id``
  values.

- If any of the ``_id`` values are not found in the database, the result
  depends on the value of the ``raise_not_found_error`` configuration
  option.
  
  If you set the ``raise_not_found_error`` option to ``true``,
  ``find`` raises a ``Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound`` error if any
  of the ``_id`` values are not found.
  
  If you set the ``raise_not_found_error`` option to ``false`` and query
  for a single ``_id`` value, ``find`` returns ``nil`` if {+odm+} does
  not match a document. If you pass multiple ``_id`` values and
  some or all are not matched, the return value is an array of any documents
  that match, or an empty array if no documents match.

find Variations
---------------

This section describes methods that are similar to the ``find`` method
described in the preceding section.

You can use the ``find_by`` method to retrieve documents based on the
provided criteria. If no documents are found, it raises an error or
returns ``nil`` depending on how you set the ``raise_not_found_error``
configuration option.

The following code demonstrates how to use the ``find_by`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-query-findby
   :end-before: end-query-findby
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

You can use the ``find_or_create_by`` method to retrieve documents
based on the provided criteria. If no documents are found, it creates
and returns an instance that is saved to MongoDB.

The following code demonstrates how to use the ``find_or_create_by``
method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-query-find-or-create
   :end-before: end-query-find-or-create
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

You can use the ``find_or_initialize_by`` method to retrieve documents
based on the provided criteria. If no documents are found, it returns a
new one, without persisting it to MongoDB. Use the same syntax for
``find_or_initialize_by`` as you do for the ``find_or_create_by``
method.

.. _mongoid-query-regex:

Regular Expressions
-------------------

{+odm+} allows you to query documents by using regular expressions in
your filter criteria.

The following code creates a sample ``Band`` model:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Band.create!(name: 'Tame Impala', description: "Tame\nImpala is an American band")
   
You can perform queries by using {+language+} regular expressions, as
shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: ruby
   
   # Matches documents in which the "name" field includes the string "impala"
   Band.where(name: /impala/i)
   # => Returns sample document

You can also perform queries by using Perl Compatible Regular Expression
(PCRE) syntax and ``BSON::Regexp::Raw`` objects:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-regex
   :end-before: end-regex
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

.. _mongoid-query-field-type-conversions:

Field Type Query Conversions
----------------------------

When you specify a query on a field defined in a model, if the field has
a *specified data type*, {+odm+} converts the query value based on how the
field is defined.

Consider the following ``Album`` model definition that
contains a ``Date``-valued field, a ``Time``-valued field, and an
implicit ``Object``-valued field. The model also intentionally *does not define*
a field named ``last_reviewed``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-field-conversion-model
   :end-before: end-field-conversion-model
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

You can query on the ``release_date`` and ``last_commented`` fields
by using ``Date`` and ``Time`` values, as shown in the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-date-queries-1
   :end-before: end-date-queries-1
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

However, if you query by using only ``Date`` values on fields defined
as other types, the generated queries display the default conversion
behavior, as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-date-queries-2
   :end-before: end-date-queries-2
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

In the preceding example, the following conversions apply:

- When using a ``Date`` value to query the ``Time``-valued
  ``last_commented`` field, {+odm+} interprets the date to be in local
  time and applies the :ref:`configured time zone
  <mongoid-config-time-zones>`.

- When querying on the ``last_purchased`` field, which has no explicit
  type, the date is used unmodified in the constructed query.
  
- When querying on the undefined ``last_reviewed`` field, {+odm+}
  interprets the ``Date`` to be in UTC and converts to a time, matching
  the behavior of querying a ``Date``-valued field such as
  ``release_date``.

Additional Query Methods
------------------------

This section describes more query methods that you can use in {+odm+}.

Count Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``count`` and ``estimated_count`` methods to count
the number of documents in a collection.

You can count the number of documents that match filter criteria by
using the ``count`` method:

.. code-block:: ruby

   # Counts all documents in collection
   Band.count

   # Counts documents that match criteria
   Band.where(country: 'England').count

.. tip:: length and size Methods

   You can also use the ``length`` or ``size`` method to count documents.
   These methods cache subsequent calls to the database, which might
   produce performance improvements.

You can get an approximate number of documents in the collection from
the collection metadata by using the ``estimated_count`` method:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Band.estimated_count

The ``estimated_count`` method does not accept query conditions,
including conditions set by a :ref:`scope <mongoid-data-scoping>` on
the model. If you are calling this method on a model that has a
default scope, you must first call the ``unscoped`` method to
disable the scope.

Ordinal Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The methods described in the following list allow you to select a specific
result from the list of returned documents based on its position.

- ``first``: Returns the first matching document. You can get the
  first ``n`` documents by passing an integer-valued parameter. This method
  automatically uses a sort on the ``_id`` field. *See lines 1-8 in the
  following code for examples.*

- ``last``: Returns the last matching document. You can get the
  last ``n`` documents by passing an integer-valued parameter. This method
  automatically uses a sort on the ``_id`` field. *See line 11 in the
  following code for an example.*

- ``first_or_create``: Returns the first matching document. If no
  document matches, creates and returns a newly saved one.

- ``first_or_initialize``: Returns the first matching document. If no
  document matches, returns a new one.

- ``second``: Returns the second matching document. Automatically uses
  a sort on the ``_id`` field.

- ``third``: Returns the third matching document. Automatically uses
  a sort on the ``_id`` field.

- ``fourth``: Returns the fourth matching document. Automatically uses
  a sort on the ``_id`` field.

- ``fifth``: Returns the fifth matching document. Automatically uses
  a sort on the ``_id`` field.

- ``second_to_last``: Returns the second-to-last matching document.
  Automatically uses a sort on the ``_id`` field. *See line 14 in the
  following code for an example.*

- ``third_to_last``: Returns the third-to-last matching document.
  Automatically uses a sort on the ``_id`` field.

The following code demonstrates how to use some methods described
in the preceding list:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-ordinal-examples
   :end-before: end-ordinal-examples
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:
   :linenos:

.. tip:: Error Generation

   Each method described in this section has a variation that is
   suffixed with ``!`` that returns an error if {+odm+} doesn't match
   any documents. For example, to implement error handling in your
   application when your query returns no results, use the ``first!``
   method instead of ``first``.

Survey Field Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To inspect the values of specified fields of documents in a
collection, you can use the following methods:

- ``distinct``: Gets a list of distinct values for a single field.
  *See lines 1-7 in the following code for examples.*

- ``pick``: Gets the values from one document for the provided fields.
  Returns ``nil`` for unset fields and for non-existent fields.
  *See line 10 in the following code for an example.*

- ``pluck``: Gets all values for the provided field. Returns ``nil``
  for unset fields and for non-existent fields.
  *See line 13 in the following code for an example.*

- ``tally``: Gets a mapping of values to counts for the specified
  field. *See line 16 in the following code for an example.*

The preceding methods accept field names referenced by using dot
notation, which allows you to reference fields in embedded associations.
They also respect :ref:`field aliases
<mongoid-field-behaviors-aliases>`, including those defined in embedded
documents.

The following code demonstrates how to use these methods:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-field-val-examples

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following list describes {+odm+} methods that do not fit into another
category:

- ``each``: Iterates over all matching documents.
  
.. code-block:: ruby
   
   # Print each matching document "name" to console
   Band.where(:members.gt => 1).each do |band|
     p band.name
   end

- ``exists?``: Determines if any matching documents exist, returning
  ``true`` if at least one matching document is found.

.. code-block:: ruby
   
   # Checks existence of any document
   Band.exists?

   # Checks existence based on query
   Band.where(name: "Le Tigre").exists?
   Band.exists?(name: "Le Tigre")

   # Checks existence based on "_id" value
   Band.exists?('6320d96a3282a48cfce9e72c')

   # Always returns false
   Band.exists?(false)
   Band.exists?(nil)
