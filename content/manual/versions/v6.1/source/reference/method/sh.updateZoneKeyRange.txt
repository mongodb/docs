.. method:: sh.updateZoneKeyRange(namespace, minimum, maximum, zone)

   Associates a range of shard key values with a :term:`zone`.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/zoned-sharding-updateZoneKeyRange-change.rst

   .. |dbcommand| replace:: :dbcommand:`updateZoneKeyRange` command
   .. include:: /includes/fact-mongosh-shell-method-alt.rst


   :method:`sh.updateZoneKeyRange()` takes the following arguments:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80

      * - Parameter

        - Type

        - Description

      * - ``namespace``

        - string

        - The :term:`namespace` of the sharded collection associate with the ``zone``.

          The collection must be sharded for the operation to succeed.



      * - ``minimum``

        - document

        - The inclusive lower bound of the range of :term:`shard key` values. 

          Specify each field of the shard key in the form of ``<fieldname> : <value>``.
          The value must be of the same BSON type or types as the shard key.

          .. note::

             To use hashed sharding, the field value needs to be of type
             :bsontype:`NumberLong <data_numberlong>`.

      * - ``maximum``

        - document

        - The exclusive upper bound of the range of :term:`shard key` values. 

          Specify each field of the shard key in the form of ``<fieldname> : <value>``.
          The value must be of the same BSON type or types as the shard key.

          .. note::

             To use hashed sharding, the field value needs to be of type
             :bsontype:`NumberLong <data_numberlong>`.

      * - ``zone``

        - string

        - The name of the zone to associate with the range of shard key values bounded
          by ``minimum`` and ``maximum``.





   Only issue :method:`sh.updateZoneKeyRange()` when connected to a
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

Behavior
--------

You cannot create a range of shard key values whose lower and upper boundaries
overlap with an existing range for the sharded collection. For example, given
an existing range of ``1`` to ``10``, you cannot create a new range of ``5``
to ``20``, as the new range would overlap with the existing range.

A zone can have multiple ranges of data associated with it, but a range
can at most be associated with a single zone.

See the :ref:`zone <zone-sharding>` manual page for more information on zones
in sharded clusters.

.. _updateZoneKeyRange-method-init-chunk-distribution:

Initial Chunk Distribution for Empty or Non-Existing Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are considering performing :ref:`zone sharding <zone-sharding>`
on an empty or non-existent collection, use
:method:`sh.updateZoneKeyRange()` to create the zones and zone ranges
*before* sharding the collection (*since 4.0.2*). Starting in version
4.0.3, creating zones and zone ranges on empty or non-existing
collections allows MongoDB to optimize the initial chunk creation and
distribution process when sharding the collection. This optimized
process supports faster setup of zoned sharding with less balancer
overhead than creating zones after sharding. The :ref:`balancer
<sharding-balancing>` performs all chunk management after the optimized
initial chunk creation and distribution.

For an example of defining zones and zone ranges for initial chunk
distribution, see :ref:`pre-define-zone-range-example`.

.. _updateZoneKeyRange-method-init-chunk-distribution-compound-hashed:

Initial Chunk Distribution with Compound Hashed Shard Keys
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Starting in version 4.4, MongoDB supports sharding collections on
:ref:`compound hashed indexes <index-type-compound-hashed>`. MongoDB can
perform optimized initial chunk creation and distribution when sharding
the empty or non-existing collection on a compound hashed shard key.

   :method:`sh.balancerCollectionStatus()`


Balancer
~~~~~~~~

After associating a range to a zone, the :ref:`balancer
<sharding-balancing-internals>` must first run in order to migrate any chunks
whose ranges are covered by the zone to shards inside of that zone. Until
balancing completes, some chunks may reside on the wrong shard given the
configured zones for the sharded cluster. See :ref:`zone-sharding-balancer`
for more information.

See the :ref:`sharded cluster balancer <sharding-balancing>` manual page for
more information on how migrations work in a sharded cluster.

Bounds
~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-shard-ranges-inclusive-exclusive.rst

Dropped Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/zoned-sharding-drop-collection-change.rst

In earlier versions, MongoDB does not remove the tag associations for a
dropped collection, and if you later create a new collection with the
same name, the old tag associations will apply to the new collection.

Security
~~~~~~~~

For sharded clusters running with :ref:`authentication <authentication>`, you
must authenticate as either:

- a user whose privileges include the specified actions on various
  collections in the ``config`` database:

  - :authaction:`find` on the ``config.shards`` collection

  - :authaction:`find` and :authaction:`update` on the ``config.tags``
    collection;

  or, alternatively,

- a user whose privileges include :authaction:`enableSharding` on the
  :ref:`cluster <resource-specific-collection>` resource (available
  starting in version 4.2.2, 4.0.14, 3.6.16).

The :authrole:`clusterAdmin` or :authrole:`clusterManager` built-in roles have
the appropriate permissions for issuing :method:`sh.updateZoneKeyRange()`. See
the documentation page for :ref:`Role-Based Access Control <authorization>`
for more information.

Examples
--------

Given a sharded collection ``exampledb.collection`` with a shard key of ``{ a
: 1 }``, the following operation creates a range with a lower bound of ``1``
and an upper bound of ``10`` on the ``alpha`` zone:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.updateZoneKeyRange(
      "exampledb.collection",
      { a : 1 },
      { a : 10 },
      "alpha"
   )

The following operation removes the previously created range by passing
``null`` to the ``zone`` field.

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.updateZoneKeyRange( 
      "exampledb.collection",
      { a : 1 },
      { a : 10 },
      null
   )

The ``min`` and ``max`` must match exactly the bounds of the target range.
The following operation attempts to remove the previously created range, but
specifies ``{ a : 0 }`` as the ``min`` bound:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.updateZoneKeyRange(
      "exampledb.collection",
      { a : 0 },
      { a : 10 },
      null
   )

While the range of ``{ a : 0 }`` and ``{ a : 10 }`` encompasses the existing
range, it is not an exact match and therefore :dbcommand:`updateZoneKeyRange`
does not remove anything.

Compound Shard Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given a sharded collection ``exampledb.collection`` with a shard key of ``{ a
: 1, b : 1 }``, the following operation creates a range covering the lower
bound of ``{ a: 1, b : 1 }`` and an upper bound of ``{ a : 10, b : 10}`` and associates it
with the ``alpha`` zone:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.updateZoneKeyRange(
      "exampledb.collection",
      { a : 1, b : 1 },
      { a : 10, b : 10 },
      "alpha"
   )

.. _pre-define-zone-range-hashed-example:

Pre-Define Zones and Zone Ranges for an Empty or Non-Existing Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 4.2, creating zones and zone ranges on empty or
non-existing collections allows MongoDB to optimize the initial chunk
creation and distribution process when sharding the collection. This
optimized process supports faster setup of zoned sharding with less
balancer overhead than creating zones after sharding. The :ref:`balancer
<sharding-balancing>` performs all chunk management after the optimized
initial chunk creation and distribution. See 
:ref:`updateZoneKeyRange-method-init-chunk-distribution-compound-hashed`
for more information.

The sections below contain examples for three different shard key types.

Consider the following examples, which explore pre-defining zones or
zone ranges for three different shard key types:

- :ref:`updatezonekeyrange-single-or-compound-example`
- :ref:`updatezonekeyrange-compound-prefix-hashed-example`
- :ref:`updatezonekeyrange-compound-non-prefix-hashed-example`

.. _updatezonekeyrange-single-or-compound-example:

Single or Compound Shard Keys
`````````````````````````````

.. note::

   This example only applies to single-field or compound shard keys
   *without* a hashed field. 
         
   For example, ``{ "zip" : 1 }`` or  
   ``{ "zip" : 1, "account" : 1}``

.. include:: /includes/steps/zones-initial-chunk-distribution-single-compound.rst

.. _updatezonekeyrange-compound-prefix-hashed-example:

Compound Hashed Shard Key with Hashed Prefix
````````````````````````````````````````````

.. note:: 

   This example only applies to compound hashed shard keys where the
   hashed field is the prefix of the shard key (i.e. the first field in
   the shard key is hashed).
  
   For example, ``{ "_id" : "hashed", "facility" : 1 }``

Starting in version 4.4, MongoDB supports sharding collections on
:ref:`compound hashed indexes <index-type-compound-hashed>`. When
sharding on a compound hashed shard key, MongoDB can perform
optimized initial chunk creation and distribution on the empty or
non-existing collection *only if* the defined zone ranges meet
:ref:`additional requirements
<updateZoneKeyRange-method-init-chunk-distribution>`.

Consider an empty collection ``examples.metrics`` which will store
analytics from one of two manufacturing facilities. The 
planned shard key is ``{ "_id" : "hashed", "facility" : 1}``,
where the hashed field is the shard key *prefix*.
 
.. include:: /includes/steps/zones-initial-chunk-distribution-compound-hashed-prefix.rst

.. _updatezonekeyrange-compound-non-prefix-hashed-example:

Compound Hashed Shard Key with Non-Prefix Hashed Field
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````

.. note:: 

   This example only applies to compound hashed shard keys where the
   hashed field is *not* the prefix of the shard key (i.e. the first
   field in the shard key is not hashed).
  
   For example, ``{ "facility" : 1, "_id" : "hashed" }``

Starting in version 4.4, MongoDB supports sharding collections on
:ref:`compound hashed indexes <index-type-compound-hashed>`. When
sharding on a compound hashed shard key, MongoDB can perform
optimized initial chunk creation and distribution on the empty or
non-existing collection *only if* the defined zone ranges meet
:ref:`additional requirements
<updateZoneKeyRange-method-init-chunk-distribution>`.

Consider an empty collection ``examples.metrics`` which will store
analytics from one of two manufacturing facilities. The planned
shard key is ``{ "facility" : 1, "_id" : "hashed" }``, where 
the hashed field is *not* the shard key prefix.

- The ``facility`` field stores the name of the facility: 
  ``"FacilityAlpha"`` or ``"FacilityBaker"``.  The 
  collection requires zone ranges on ``facility`` to help isolate 
  data for each facility to specific shards. 

- The ``_id`` field compensates for the low-cardinality of the 
  ``facility`` field. Hashing compensates for the
  monotonically-increasing nature of the ``_id`` field.
