   .. note:: **Available only with Cloud Manager Premium**. This feature is
      available only with Cloud Manager Premium, which comes with certain
      MongoDB subscriptions. `Contact MongoDB <https://www.mongodb.com/contact>`_.

Overview
--------

|mms| Automation lets you build MongoDB indexes without downtime for your
deployment. The Automation Agent will sequentially take each individual
node in a replica set or cluster offline to build the indexes. The
agent builds the indexes without increasing load on your deployment or
blocking read or write operations. You can create any type of MongoDB
index. For available types, see :manual:`Index Types </core/index-types>`
in the MongoDB manual.

.. warning::

   The Automation Agent does not currently support automated removal of an index
   from a collection. To remove an index that is managed by the Automation
   Agent, you must first remove the index from Automation and then manually
   remove the index from the collection. See the :ref:`remove-index`
   procedures below.
