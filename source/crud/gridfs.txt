Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to store and retrieve large files in
MongoDB by using **GridFS**. The GridFS storage system 
splits files into chunks when storing them and reassembles those files when retrieving them.
The driver's implementation of GridFS is an abstraction that manages the operations and
organization of the file storage. 

Use GridFS if the size of any of your files exceeds the BSON document
size limit of 16 MB. For more detailed information about whether GridFS is
suitable for your use case, see :manual:`GridFS </core/gridfs>` in the
{+mdb-server+} manual.

How GridFS Works
----------------

GridFS organizes files in a **bucket**, a group of MongoDB collections
that contain the chunks of files and information describing them. The
bucket contains the following collections:

- ``chunks``: Stores the binary file chunks
- ``files``: Stores the file metadata

The driver creates the GridFS bucket, if it doesn't already exist, when you first
write data to it. The bucket contains the ``chunks`` and ``files`` collections
prefixed with the default bucket name ``fs``, unless you specify a different
name. To ensure efficient retrieval of the files and related metadata, the driver
creates an index on each collection. The driver ensures that these indexes exist
before performing read and write operations on the GridFS bucket.
	
For more information about GridFS indexes, see :manual:`GridFS Indexes
</core/gridfs/#gridfs-indexes>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

When using GridFS to store files, the driver splits the files into smaller
chunks, each represented by a separate document in the ``chunks`` collection.
It also creates a document in the ``files`` collection that contains
a file ID, file name, and other file metadata.

The following diagram shows how GridFS splits files when they are
uploaded to a bucket:

.. figure:: /includes/figures/GridFS-upload.png
   :alt: A diagram that shows how GridFS uploads a file to a bucket

When retrieving files, GridFS fetches the metadata from the ``files``
collection in the specified bucket and uses the information to reconstruct
the file from documents in the ``chunks`` collection.

.. _csharp-gridfs-create-bucket:

Create a GridFS Bucket
----------------------

To begin using GridFS to store or retrieve files, create a new instance of the
``GridFSBucket`` class, passing in an ``IMongoDatabase`` object that represents your
database. This method accesses an existing bucket or creates
a new bucket if one does not exist.

The following example creates a new instance of the ``GridFSBucket`` class for the
``db`` database:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/GridFS.cs
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:
   :start-after: // start-create-bucket
   :end-before: // end-create-bucket
  
.. _csharp-gridfs-create-custom-bucket:

Customize the Bucket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can customize the GridFS bucket configuration by passing an instance
of the ``GridFSBucketOptions`` class to 
the ``GridFSBucket()`` constructor. The following table describes the properties in the
``GridFSBucketOptions`` class:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field 
     - Description

   * - ``BucketName`` 
     - The bucket name to use as a prefix for the files and chunks collections.
       The default value is ``"fs"``.
       
       **Data type**: {+string-data-type+} 

   * - ``ChunkSizeBytes`` 
     - The chunk size that GridFS splits files into. The default value is 255 KB.
       
       **Data type**: {+int-data-type+}

   * - ``ReadConcern`` 
     - The read concern to use for bucket operations. The default value is the 
       database's read concern.
       
       **Data type**: `ReadConcern <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Driver/MongoDB.Driver.ReadConcern.html>`__

   * - ``ReadPreference`` 
     - The read preference to use for bucket operations. The default value is the 
       database's read preference.
       
       **Data type**: `ReadPreference <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Driver/MongoDB.Driver.ReadPreference.html>`__

   * - ``WriteConcern`` 
     - The write concern to use for bucket operations. The default value is the 
       database's write concern.
       
       **Data type**: `WriteConcern <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Driver/MongoDB.Driver.WriteConcern.html>`__

The following example creates a bucket named ``"myCustomBucket"`` by passing an instance
of the ``GridFSBucketOptions`` class to the ``GridFSBucket()`` constructor:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/GridFS.cs
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:
   :start-after: // start-create-custom-bucket
   :end-before: // end-create-custom-bucket

.. _csharp-gridfs-upload-files:

Upload Files
------------

You can upload files to a GridFS bucket by using the following methods:

- ``OpenUploadStream()`` or ``OpenUploadStreamAsync()``: Opens a new upload stream to which
  you can write file contents
- ``UploadFromStream()`` or ``UploadFromStreamAsync()``: Uploads the contents of an existing
  stream to a GridFS file

The following sections describe how to use these methods.

.. _csharp-gridfs-open-upload-stream:

Write to an Upload Stream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``OpenUploadStream()`` or ``OpenUploadStreamAsync()`` method to create an upload
stream for a given file name. These methods accept the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``filename``
     - The name of the file to upload.
        
       **Data type**: {+string-data-type+}
   * - ``options``
     - *Optional.* An instance of the ``GridFSUploadOptions`` class that specifies the
       configuration for the upload stream. The default value is ``null``.
        
       **Data type**: `GridFSUploadOptions <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Driver/MongoDB.Driver.GridFS.GridFSUploadOptions.html>`__
   * - ``cancellationToken``
     - *Optional.* A token that you can use to cancel the operation.
        
       **Data type**: `CancellationToken <https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.threading.cancellationtoken>`__

This code example demonstrates how to open an upload stream by performing the
following steps:

- Calls the ``OpenUploadStream()`` method to open a writable GridFS stream for a file
  named ``"my_file"``
- Calls the ``Write()`` method to write data to ``my_file``
- Calls the ``Close()`` method to close the stream that points to ``my_file``

To customize the upload stream configuration, pass an instance of the
``GridFSUploadOptions`` class to the ``OpenUploadStream()`` or ``OpenUploadStreamAsync()``
method. The ``GridFSUploadOptions`` class contains the following properties:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description
   * - ``BatchSize``
     - The number of chunks to upload in each batch. The default value is 16 MB
       divided by the value of the ``ChunkSizeBytes`` property. 
        
       **Data type**: ``int?`` 
       
   * - ``ChunkSizeBytes``
     - The size of each chunk except the last, which is smaller. The default value is 255 KB.
        
       **Data type**: ``int?``

   * - ``Metadata``
     - Metadata to store with the file, including the following elements:

       - The ``_id`` of the file
       - The name of the file
       - The length and size of the file
       - The upload date and time
       - A ``metadata`` document in which you can store other information

       The default value is ``null``.
        
       **Data type**: `BsonDocument <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Bson/MongoDB.Bson.BsonDocument.html>`__

The following example performs the same steps as the preceding example, but also uses
the ``ChunkSizeBytes`` option to specify the size of each chunk. Select the

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description
   
   * - ``Sort``
     - The sort order of the results. If you don't specify a sort order, the
       method returns the results in the order in which they were inserted.
        
       **Data type**: ``SortDefinition<GridFSFileInfo>``. For more information, see
       the API documentation for the
       `Sort <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Driver/MongoDB.Driver.GridFS.GridFSFindOptions.Sort.html>`__
       property.

.. _csharp-gridfs-delete-files:

Delete Files
------------

To delete files from a GridFS bucket, call the ``Delete()`` or ``DeleteAsync()`` method
on your ``GridFSBucket`` instance. This method removes a file's metadata collection and
its associated chunks from your bucket.

The ``Delete`` and ``DeleteAsync()`` methods accept the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``id``
     - The ``_id`` of the file to delete. 
        
       **Data type**: `BsonValue <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Bson/MongoDB.Bson.BsonValue.html>`__
   * - ``cancellationToken``
     - *Optional.* A token that you can use to cancel the operation.
        
       **Data type**: `CancellationToken <https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.threading.cancellationtoken>`__

The following code example shows how to delete a file named ``"my_file"``
passing its ``_id`` value to ``delete_file()``:

- Uses the ``Builders`` class to create a filter that matches the file named ``"my_file"``
- Uses the ``Find()`` method to find the file named ``"my_file"``
- Passes the ``_id`` value of the file to the ``Delete()`` method to delete the file

.. note:: File Revisions

   The ``Delete()`` and ``DeleteAsync()`` methods support deleting only one file at a time.
   To delete each file revision, or files with different upload
   times that share the same file name, collect the ``_id`` values of each revision.
   Then, pass each ``_id`` value in separate calls to the ``Delete()`` or ``DeleteAsync()``
   method.
