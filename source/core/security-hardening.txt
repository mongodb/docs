To reduce the risk exposure of the entire MongoDB system, ensure that
only trusted hosts have access to MongoDB.

MongoDB Configuration Hardening
-------------------------------

For MongoDB, ensure that HTTP status interface and the REST API are
disabled in production to prevent potential data exposure to attackers.

For more information, see :doc:`/core/security-mongodb-configuration`.

Network Hardening
-----------------

To restrict exposure to MongoDB, configure firewalls to control access to
MongoDB systems. Use of VPNs can also provide a secure tunnel.

For more information, see :doc:`/core/security-network`.
