MongoDB supports x.509 certificate authentication for client
authentication and internal authentication of the members of replica
sets and sharded clusters.

x.509 certificate authentication requires a secure :doc:`TLS/SSL
connection </tutorial/configure-ssl>`.

Client x.509 Certificates
-------------------------

To authenticate to servers, clients can use x.509 certificates instead
of usernames and passwords.

.. _client-x509-mongodb-user:

MongoDB User and ``$external`` Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To authenticate with a client certificate, you must first add the client 
certificate's ``subject`` as a MongoDB user in the ``$external`` database. 
The ``$external`` database is the :ref:`authentication-database` for the user.

Each unique x.509 client certificate is for one MongoDB user.
You cannot use a single client certificate to authenticate more than one
MongoDB user.

Member x.509 Certificates
-------------------------

For internal authentication between members of sharded clusters and
replica sets, you can use x.509 certificates instead of :doc:`keyfiles
