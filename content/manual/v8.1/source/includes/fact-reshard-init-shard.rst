When you run the |shardCmd|, the balancer begins distributing
the collection data to other shards in the cluster. A single
shard can only participate in one chunk migration at a time,
When MongoDB succeeds in copying a range of data from one shard
to another, the range on the donor shard is marked for removal
by the range deleter. This process is slow and resource
intensive.

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, if your deployment meets the
:ref:`resource requirements <reshard-to-same-key-req>`, it's
recommended you use the |reshardCmd| to perform this initial
balancing of data by resharding to the same key. This causes
MongoDB to rebalance data across the shards without waiting on
the balancer.

To use the |reshardCmd| to perform the initial balancing:

#. Use the |shardCmd| to configure the collection as a sharded
   collection. 

#. Use the |reshardCmd| to reshard to the same shard key by
   setting the ``forceRedistribution`` option to ``true``.
   MongoDB then balances the data across the shards.
