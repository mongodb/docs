A *replica set* in MongoDB is a group of :program:`mongod` processes
that maintain the same data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and
high availability, and are the basis for all production deployments.
This section introduces replication in MongoDB as well as the
components and architecture of replica sets. The section also provides
tutorials for common tasks related to replica sets.
