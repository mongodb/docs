Overview
--------

Often, an application needs to derive a value from source data stored 
in a database. Computing a new value may require significant CPU 
resources, especially in the case of large data sets or in cases where 
multiple documents must be examined.

If a computed value is requested often, it can be more efficient to 
save that value in the database ahead of time. This way, when the 
application requests data, only one read operation is required.

Computed Pattern
----------------

If your reads significantly outnumber your writes, the computed pattern 
reduces the frequency of having to perform computations. Instead of 
attaching the burden of computation to every read, the application 
stores the computed value and recalculates it as needed. The
application can either recompute the value with every write that 
changes the computed value's source data, or as part of a periodic job.

.. note::

   With periodic updates, the computed value is not guaranteed to be 
   exact in any given read. However, this approach may be worth the 
   performance boost if exact accuracy isn't a requirement.

Example
-------

An application displays movie viewer and revenue information.

Consider the following ``screenings`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   db.screenings.insertMany( [
      {
         theater : "Alger Cinema",
         location : "Lakeview, OR",
         movie_title : "Reservoir Dogs",
         num_viewers : 344,
         revenue : 3440
      },
      {
         theater : "City Cinema",
         location : "New York, NY",
         movie_title : "Reservoir Dogs",
         num_viewers : 1496,
         revenue : 22440
      },
      {
         theater : "Overland Park Cinema",
         location : "Boise, ID",
         movie_title : "Reservoir Dogs",
         num_viewers : 760,
         revenue : 7600
      }
   ] )

Users often want to know how many people saw a certain movie and how 
much money that movie made. In this example, to total ``num_viewers`` 
and ``revenue``, you must perform a read for theaters that screened a 
movie with the title "Reservoir Dogs" and sum the values of those 
fields. To avoid performing that computation every time the information 
is requested, you can compute the total values and store them in a 
``movies`` collection with the movie record itself:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 4-5

   db.movies.insertOne( [
      {
         title : "Reservoir Dogs",
         total_viewers : 2600,
         total_revenue : 33480,
         ...
      }
   ] )

In a low write environment, the computation could be done in 
conjunction with any update of the ``screenings`` data.

In an environment with more regular writes, the computations could be 
done at defined intervals - every hour for example. The source data in 
``screenings`` isn't affected by writes to the ``movies`` collection, 
so you can run calculations at any time.

This is a common design pattern that reduces CPU workload and increases 
application performance. Whenever you are performing the same 
calculations repeatedly and you have a high read to write ratio, 
consider the Computed Pattern.

Other Sample Use Cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to cases where summing is requested frequently, such as 
getting total revenue or viewers in the movie database example, the 
computed pattern is a good fit wherever calculations need to be run 
against data. For example:

- A car company that runs massive aggregation queries on vehicle data, 
  storing results to show for the next few hours until the data is 
  recomputed.

- A consumer reporting company that compiles data from several 
  different sources to create rank-ordered lists like the "100 
  Best-Reviewed Gadgets". The lists can be regenerated periodically 
  while the underlying data is updated independently.
