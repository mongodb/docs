Data sources in |charts| reference a :ref:`collection <collections>`
or :manual:`view </views/#std-label-3.4-reference-views>` in your 
MongoDB deployment. The fields in that collection or view can be used
to construct a chart. When building a chart, you must specify
the data source that the chart uses.
