Overview
--------

Data in MongoDB has a *flexible schema*. :term:`Collections
<collection>` do not enforce :term:`document` structure. Decisions
that affect how you model data can affect application performance and
database capacity. See :doc:`/core/data-modeling` for a full high
level overview of data modeling in MongoDB.

This document describes a data model that describes a tree like
structure that optimizes discovering subtrees at the expense of tree
mutability.

Pattern

The *Nested Sets* pattern identifies each node in the tree as stops in
a round-trip traversal of the tree. The application visits each node
in the tree twice; first during the initial trip, and second during
the return trip. The *Nested Sets* pattern stores each tree node in a
document; in addition to the tree node, document stores the id of
node's parent, the node's initial stop in the ``left`` field, and its
return stop in the ``right`` field.

Consider the following example that models a tree of categories using
*Nested Sets*:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.categories.insert( { _id: "Books", parent: 0, left: 1, right: 12 } )
   db.categories.insert( { _id: "Programming", parent: "Books", left: 2, right: 11 } )
   db.categories.insert( { _id: "Languages", parent: "Programming", left: 3, right: 4 } )
   db.categories.insert( { _id: "Databases", parent: "Programming", left: 5, right: 10 } )
   db.categories.insert( { _id: "MongoDB", parent: "Databases", left: 6, right: 7 } )
   db.categories.insert( { _id: "Postgres", parent: "Databases", left: 8, right: 9 } )

You can query to retrieve the descendants of a node:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var databaseCategory = db.v.findOne( { _id: "Databases" } );
   db.categories.find( { left: { $gt: databaseCategory.left }, right: { $lt: databaseCategory.right } } );

The *Nested Sets* pattern provides a fast and efficient solution for
finding subtrees but is inefficient for modifying the tree structure.
As such, this pattern is best for static trees that do not change.
