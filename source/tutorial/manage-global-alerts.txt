Global Alerts

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Global alerts apply the same alert configuration to multiple groups. When
the alert condition occurs for a given group, |onprem| sends notification
only to that group.

As with :doc:`an alert created for a specific group
</tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>`, |onprem| sends notifications for
a global alert at regular intervals until the alert :ref:`resolves
<resolved-alert>` or gets :ref:`canceled <cancelled-alert>`.

To access global alerts you must have the
:ref:`global-monitoring-admin-role` role or :ref:`global-owner-role` role.
