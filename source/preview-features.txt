   :description: Learn about the features and limitations of public and private preview programs 

Products and features that we offer as private or public previews (or any other
type of beta stage) are only for internal evaluation by our end users. Use these
experimental features in isolated development environments only, never in
production systems or with critical data.

Technical Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Preview and other beta-stage offerings:

- Are not production-ready

- May contain bugs, errors, or defects

- In production environments, could potentially lead to unexpected or
  undesired results like data loss and other operational disruptions

Other Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Preview and other beta-stage offerings:

- Are not covered by MongoDB's standard support channels or uptime SLAs

- May not be subject to MongoDB's regular security and compliance frameworks

MongoDB might modify or terminate preview offerings at any time. If we change or
end-of-life one of these offerings, we do our best to notify users beforehand
but do not guarantee a pre-announcement.
