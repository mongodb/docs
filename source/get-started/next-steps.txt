Congratulations on completing the tutorial!

In this tutorial, you created a {+driver-short+} application that
connects to a MongoDB deployment hosted on MongoDB Atlas
and retrieves a document that matches a query. 

You can continue to develop your sample application by 
visiting the following guides:

- :ref:`java-db-coll`: Learn more about interacting with
  MongoDB databases and collections.
- :ref:`java-integrations`: Learn about the third-party
  integrations that you can use with the {+driver-short+}.
