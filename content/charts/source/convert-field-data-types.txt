Convert Field Data Types

.. meta::
   :description: Convert field data types in MongoDB Charts to different types like numbers, dates, or booleans using the Chart Builder's conversion feature.

You can convert the data type of the fields returned from your data
source in the Chart Builder to a different data type. For example, you
can convert numbers stored as strings to numbers, convert dates stored
as strings or Unix timestamps to dates, or treat ObjectId fields as
dates.

Requirements & Limitations
--------------------------

- Your deployment must use MongoDB 4.0 or later.

- You cannot convert GeoJSON fields.

- You cannot convert arrays nested more than one level deep.

Convert a Field's Data Type
---------------------------

To convert a field's data type, click on that field and select
:guilabel:`Convert type` from the :guilabel:`Ellipsis (...)` menu.

   :alt: To change a field's data type, click on that field and select "Convert type" from the ellipses menu.

|charts| supports converting data into the following types:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Label
     - BSON Type

   * - :guilabel:`String`
     - :manual:`String </reference/operator/aggregation/convert/#convert-to-string>`

   * - :guilabel:`Date`
     - :manual:`Date </reference/operator/aggregation/convert/#convert-to-date>`

   * - :guilabel:`Number`
     - :manual:`Double </reference/operator/aggregation/convert/#convert-to-double>`

   * - :guilabel:`Boolean`
     - :manual:`Bool </reference/operator/aggregation/convert/#convert-to-bool>`

Data types are converted by an 
:manual:`aggregation pipeline </core/aggregation-pipeline>`.
For each type conversion you select, you can find the underlying
aggregation stage by
:ref:`viewing your aggregation pipeline <view-aggregation-pipeline>`.

To see the effects of your conversion on a sample document, 
:ref:`view a sample source document <view-source-documents>`.

Your conversions are saved with your chart definition.

Convert Data Types in an Array
------------------------------

You can convert arrays of primitive data and fields of primitive data
from arrays of documents. Each item in the array is converted to the
new type. However, if the conversion is invalid or if the original
value of the item is ``null``, the item converts to ``null``. You
cannot convert arrays nested more than one level deep.

.. example::

   You have an array of strings:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      ["1", "fish", "42"]

   Applying the :guilabel:`Number` data type conversion returns the
   following array:
      
   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      [1, null, 45]

.. example::

   You have an array of documents with fields ``foo`` and ``bar``:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      [{foo: "1", bar: "2"}, {foo: "fish", bar: "tacos"}, {foo: "45",
      bar: "46"}]

   Applying the :guilabel:`Number` data type conversion to the ``foo``
   field returns the following array of documents:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      [{foo: 1, bar: "2"}, {foo: null, bar: "tacos"}, {foo: 45, bar:
      "46"}]

Revert a Field's Data Type Conversion
-------------------------------------

A converted field's icon reflects the new data type and turns green.
To remove a conversion and return the field to its original data type,
select :guilabel:`Auto Detect` from the :guilabel:`Ellipses (...)`
:icon-fa5:`arrow-right` :guilabel:`Convert Type` menu.

.. figure:: /images/charts/converted-field-icon-example.png
   :figwidth: 70%
   :alt: A field converted to a string will show a green "A" symbol to indicate its new status.
