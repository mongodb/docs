Developers worldwide use MongoDB. A small amount of content has been
translated, but most has not, which means that many customers who don't
speak English as their first language consume our English content. All
of the guidelines in this topic ("Basic writing guidelines") are
designed to make content easy to understand for all audiences, but the
following guidelines will especially clarify content for global
audiences.

.. _idioms:
.. _colloquialisms:

Don't Use Idioms or Colloquialisms
----------------------------------

An **idiom** is an expression whose meaning can't be derived from the
literal meaning of the individual words. Some examples are *in a
nutshell*, *the bottom line*, *across the board*, and *on the fly*.

A **colloquialism** is an expression considered more appropriate to
familiar and casual conversation than to formal speech or to formal
writing. Although we might like to establish a more conversational tone
in some content, colloquialisms can be hard for non-native English
speakers to understand.

Avoid idioms and colloquialisms as often as possible.

The following table lists some idioms and colloquialisms and provides
alternatives that you can use.

     - slightly smaller than

   * - when you're done

.. _metaphors:

Avoid Metaphorical Terms
------------------------

A **metaphor** is a figure of speech in which a word or phrase that
denotes one kind of object or action replaces another to suggest a
likeness or analogy between them. Although some common metaphors are
easy even for people who don't speak English as a first language, avoid
them as often as possible.

The following table provides some examples of metaphorical terms that
can easily be replaced with one or more words.

.. list-table::

   * - Metaphor
     - Alternative

   * - a handful of companies
     - a few companies

   * - table a discussion
     - postpone a discussion

   * - the vanilla model
     - the standard model

   * - avoid common pitfalls
     - avoid common problems

   * - the drawback of frequent updates
     - the disadvantage of frequent updates

.. _humor:

Don't Use Humor
---------------

Humor is culture specific. What might be funny in one culture might be
offensive or obscene in another culture. Humor doesn't translate well,
literally or figuratively, so don't use it.

Use Jargon with Care
--------------------

**Jargon** is the specialized language of a profession. Jargon can be
useful for technical audiences, but it can be meaningless to novice
users and difficult to translate.

- Don't use jargon if you can easily and correctly use a more common or
  familiar term.
- Don't use jargon if the jargon obfuscates rather than clarifies the
  meaning.
- Use jargon if the jargon is essential to the technical meaning of the
  content.
- Consider explaining any jargon that you use if the audience isn't
  highly technical.

The following table lists some jargon typical of the tech industry and
possible alternatives.

.. _culture-neutral:

Use Culture-Neutral Language and Examples
-----------------------------------------

Cultural references and examples in your documentation can cause
problems for a global audience and for translation. Sounds, colors,
animals, gestures, events, and symbols don't convey the same meaning in
every culture.

- Don't use the names of places, public figures, or holidays. If you
  must, use examples that represent a variety of cultures or that are
  internationally recognized. For example, use international cities,
  such as Paris, New York, Tokyo, London, and Hong Kong.

- Don't use political, religious, ethnic, or historical references.

- Don't use metaphors that are specific to one culture (for example,
  an American football metaphor).

- Use generic examples that work in any target market.

If you create "named" users for extended examples or scenarios, use
names that represent a variety of ethnic backgrounds, genders, and
locations.

.. _oppressive-language:

Use Non-Oppressive Language
---------------------------

The words you choose can have meanings separate from their dictionary
definitions. To ignore that ignores the power of speech and writing.
MongoDB wants to empower everyone to use our technology. Keeping with
that goal, we must consider our use of terms identified as racist,
sexist, or otherwise oppressive. Some terms lack any ambiguity.

The following table lists terms to avoid and some acceptable
alternatives.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 10 20 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Term
     - Part
     - Alternatives
     - Examples

   * - black hat
     - adj
     - unethical
     - MongoDB discourages unethical hacking of its databases.

   * - blacklist
     - v
     - remove (from an access list), deny (access to),
       block (access to)
     - MongoDB Atlas denies that IP address access to the database.

   * - blacklist
     - n
     - access list, blocklist, exclude list
     - That IP address has been removed from the access list for the
       **shipwreck** database.

   * - master
     - n, adj
     - primary, active, coordinator
     - Replica sets have one primary and two or more secondary members.

   * - slave
     - n, adj
     - secondary, standby, subordinate, replica, worker
     - Replica sets have one primary and two or more secondary members.

   * - slave
     - v
     - subordinate
     - This slower hard drive has been subordinated to this faster hard
       drive for backup purposes.

       .. note::

          Docs discourages using either term as a verb. This is
          included to account for possible usage.

   * - white hat
     - adj
     - ethical
     - MongoDB understands that you may need to conduct ethical hacking
       to test the security of your databases.

   * - whitelist
     - v
     - add (to an access list), allow (access to), permit (access to)
     - MongoDB Atlas allows that IP address to access to the database.

   * - whitelist
     - n
     - access list, allow list, allowed list
     - That IP address has been added from the access list for the
       **shipwreck** database.

.. _neutral-graphics:

Use Culture-Neutral Graphics
----------------------------

Use graphics whenever possible to present processes and complex ideas.
However, be aware of the following possible issues:

- Some users don't typically read from left to right. If a graphic
  illustrates a sequence, make that sequence explicit by using numbers,
  arrows, or directional terms.

- Don't rely on color alone to convey meaning. The color red, for
  example, has different meanings in different countries so could be
  interpreted differently by different users. Also, colors can have
  political or religious significance. Use neutral colors as often as
  possible.

- Don't use a picture of a hand by itself (for example, a hand that is
  pointing). Almost every hand gesture is offensive to someone. A
  picture of a hand that is holding an item or interacting with
  something is generally acceptable.

- Use generic or international images. Some examples are soccer
  players and equipment, generic landscapes, pens and pencils, and
  generic images of computer equipment. Avoid using images of men,
  women, flags, maps, animals, alcohol, trendy objects, historical
  references, or film, cartoon, or video characters.
