   Click Events in the `Charts Embedding SDK
   <https://github.com/mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk>`__ is available as 
   a beta feature. It is only available with Charts Embedding 
   JavaScript SDK v1.2.0-beta.1.

The Charts Embedding JavaScript SDK includes a click event handler that 
allows you to subscribe to click events. When you click on a particular 
element on your chart, the click event handler captures details of the 
element that you clicked. Use this feature to build interactive 
experiences similar to the following in your application:

- Click on an element on a chart and open a pane with more details on 
  the clicked element. 
- Create a filter for another chart.

.. _click-event-prereqs:

Prerequisites 
-------------

Before you begin, :ref:`install <embedding-charts-sdk>` the Charts 
Embedding JavaScript SDK. 

.. _click-event-syntax:

Click Event Syntax 
------------------

The event handler takes an event type, ``click``, and a callback 
function that contains information about the click event and the 
clicked element as a single :ref:`payload <click-event-payload>` 
object. The click event handler syntax looks similar to the following:

.. code-block:: sh 
   :copyable: false 

   chart.addEventListener("click", callback); 

.. _click-event-payload:

Payload 
-------

You can use the click event payload to construct a custom filter that 
you can apply on other charts in your application. The syntax of the 
payload object for the callback function looks similar to the 
following: 

.. code-block:: sh 
   :copyable: false 

   chart.addEventListener("click", (payload) => { 
       // handle events
   }

The following example payload object shows the elements inside the 
payload:

.. example:: 

   .. code-block:: sh 
      :copyable: false 

      chart.addEventListener("click", (payload) => {
        "chartId": "xxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "chartTitle": "This is my chart's title", 
        "chartDescription": "This is my chart's description",
        "event": { // information about the mouse event. For example:
          "type": "click", // event type 

          "altKey": false, // modifier keys
          "ctrlKey": false,
          "shiftKey": false,
          "metaKey": false,

          "offsetX": 152, // element coordinates
          "offsetY": 176,

          "clientX": 172, // coordinates from application viewpoint
          "clientY": 241,

          "pageX": 172, // coordinates relative to the page
          "pageY": 241,

          "screenX": 172, // coordinates relative to screen
          "screenY": 312
        },
        "data": { // information about the clicked chart element. For example:
          "y": {
            "label": "unwind array 'genres'",
            "value": "Adventure"
          },
          "x": {
            "label": "count ( _id )",
            "value": 659
          },
          "color": {
            "label": "year",
            "value": "2000 - 2010",
            "lowerBound": 2000,
            "upperBound": 2010
          }
        },
        selectionFilter: {
          // category data expressed as MQL filter query that  
          // interactive filters would output to filter other charts. 
          // For example:

          genres: 'Adventure', 
          year: {
            $gte: 2000,
            $lt: 2010,
          },
        },
        "target": { // information about the clicked target. For example:
          "type": "rect", // type of mark, such as rect, line, etc.
          "role": "mark", // role of mark, such as mark, legend, etc.
          "fill": "#8CB6F2" // fill color of the mark
        },
        "apiVersion": 1 // API version of event payload
      }); 

To learn more about the elements inside the payload object, see: 

- :ref:`click-event-payload-event`
- :ref:`click-event-payload-data`
- :ref:`click-event-payload-selection-filter`
- :ref:`click-event-payload-target`

.. _click-event-payload-event:

``event`` Element 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``event`` element of the :ref:`payload <click-event-payload>` 
contains information about the mouse event including: 

- The type of mouse event, which must be ``click``
- The modifier keys used to trigger a click event such as ``altKey``, 
  ``ctrlKey``, ``shiftKey``, ``metaKey``
- The ``X`` and ``Y`` coordinates:

  - Relative to the canvas element of the chart 
  - From the application viewpoint
  - Relative to the page
  - Relative to the screen

.. _click-event-payload-data:

``data`` Element 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``data`` element of the :ref:`payload <click-event-payload>` 
contains information about the clicked chart element. For each encoded 
data field (``x``, ``y``, ``series``, ``intensity``, ``color``, 
``shape``, ``size``, ``label``, ``arc``, ``value``, ``target``, 
``number``, ``display``, ``text``, ``location``), the ``data`` element 
contains:

- The channel ``label``
- The ``value`` of the clicked element
- The lower bound for numeric or date binning only

For :ref:`data tables <data-table-ref>`, the Charts Embedding 
JavaScript SDK click event handler captures click events for the 
following elements: 

- Chart title 
- Fields that represent the channel data for the clicked element: 
  
  - ``groups`` field, which contains all Groups channels including 
    label and value
  - ``cell`` field, which contains the column header label and value of 
    the clicked cell

.. _click-event-payload-selection-filter:

``selectionFilter`` Element
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``selectionFilter`` element of the :ref:`payload 
<click-event-payload>` must contain a valid :abbr:`MQL (MongoDB Query 
Language)` filter document, which represents the filter that 
corresponds to the clicked mark's category channels or ``x`` value 
channel on a continuous chart. You can modify or implement your own 
``selectionFilter``.

The filter object represents a single clicked item: 

- A string or unbinned number or date, which becomes an equality match 
  query ``({field: value})`` or a query using ``$eq``, ``$ne``, ``$in``, or ``$nin`` operators.
- A binned number or date, which becomes a query using ``gt``, 
  ``$gte``, ``$lt``, or ``lte`` operators. Periodic dates are ignored.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: sh 
      :copyable: false 

      { field: 'value' } 
      { field1: 'value1', field2: 'value2' }
      { field: { $in: [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ] } }
      { field: { $nin: [ 'x', 'y', 'z' ] } }
      { field: { $gt: 10 } }
      { field: { $gt: 13, $lte: 30 } }
      { field: { $gt: Date("2020-01-01"), $lt: Date("2020-03-31") } }

The ``selectionFilter`` document can have several key and value 
filters. For example, if a mark of a multi-series chart is clicked, the 
filter document contains both the category and series filter pairs. 
Each filter must reference the actual data source fields used and not 
their labels.

.. _click-event-payload-target:

``target`` Element 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``target`` element of the :ref:`payload <click-event-payload>` 
contains information about the clicked target including: 

- The type of mark, such as ``rect``, ``line``, ``arc``, ``symbol``, 
  etc.
- The role of mark, such as ``mark``, ``legend``, ``axis-label``, etc.
- The fill color of the mark

For :ref:`data tables <data-table-ref>`, the Charts Embedding 
JavaScript SDK click event handler payload captures the following: 

- Mark type, which is ``text`` 
- Mark role, such as ``group-cell``, ``value-cell``, 
  ``dynamic-value-cell``, ``row-total-cell``,  
  ``column-total-cell``, ``header-column-total-cell``, and
  ``grand-total-cell``

The Charts Embedding JavaScript SDK click event handler does not 
capture click events on column headers.

Examples 
--------

The Charts Embedding JavaScript SDK includes examples that demonstrate 
common uses for click events in an application. The first example shows 
basic click events and payload handling. The second example shows 
interactive filtering of clicked chart elements. 

To learn more about installing the Embedding SDK and running the 
example app with your own data or sample data, see `MongoDB Charts 
Embedding Example for Click Events on GitHub
<https://github.com/mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk/tree/master/examples/click-events-basic>`__. 
Each example app is configured with a chart ID and base URL which are 
particular to the app. Be sure to configure your own apps with the 
correct chart ID and base URL. 

.. _click-event-eg-basic:

Basic Handling of Click Events  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the `example app 
<https://codesandbox.io/s/github/mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk/tree/master/examples/click-events-basic>`__ 
for basic handling of click events, when you click on an element on the 
``Movie Genres`` chart, the click event handler displays data based on 
the clicked element. 

Each time you click on an element in the chart, the click event 
listener refreshes the ``payload`` to reflect data from the ``x`` and 
``y`` axis. When you click on an element that represents a specific 
genre and decade in the ``Movie Genres`` chart, the ``Clicked Element`` 
and ``Full Event Payload`` displays details on that movie genre and 
decade including: 

- Fields that represent data for the clicked element.
- Mark type, role, and fill color. 

Refer to the example app to view the full event payload.

.. _click-event-eg-interactive:

Interactive Filtering for Click Events 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the `example app
<https://codesandbox.io/s/github/mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk/tree/master/examples/click-events-filtering>`__ 
for interactive filtering, when you click on an element on the ``Movie 
Genres`` chart, the embedding SDK generates a filter based on the 
element on which you clicked and then applies the filter to a second 
chart. 

The click event listener generates a filter based on the ``y`` axis, 
which represents the movie genres, and the lower and upper bound range, 
which represents the decade. Each time you click on an element that 
represents a specific genre and decade on the ``Movie Genres`` chart, 
the ``Movie Details`` data table is filtered by the clicked element and 
changes to display the movies available in that genre and decade. 

Refer to the example app to view the full event payload.
