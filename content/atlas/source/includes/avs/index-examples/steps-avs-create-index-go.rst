.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: Create a file called ``create-index.go`` and define the index in the file.

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/avs/index-management/create-index/create-index.go

      .. note:: Programmatic Index Creation
      
         The MongoDB Go driver supports programmatic {+avs+} index management starting
         in v1.16.0, but the preceding code shows the syntax for the v2.x driver.

   .. step:: Replace the following values and save the file.

      .. list-table:: 
         :stub-columns: 1 

         * - ``<connectionString>``
           - |service| connection string. To learn more, see :ref:`connect-via-driver`.

         * - ``<databaseName>``
           - Database that contains the collection for which you want to create the index.

         * - ``<collectionName>``
           - Collection for which you want to create the index.

         * - ``<indexName>``
           - Name of your index. If you omit the index name, defaults to ``vector_index``.

         * - ``<numberOfDimensions>``
           - Number of vector dimensions that {+avs+} enforces at index-time and query-time.

         * - ``<fieldToIndex>``
           - Vector and filter fields to index.

      .. example::

         Copy and paste the following into the ``create-index.go`` file
         and replace the ``<connectionString>`` placeholder value. The
         following index definition indexes the ``plot_embedding_voyage_3_large```` field
         as the ``vector`` type and the ``genres`` and ``year`` fields
         as the ``filter`` type in an {+avs+} index. The
         ``plot_embedding_voyage_3_large```` field contains embeddings created using
         |voyage|'s ``voyage-3-large`` embeddings model. The index 
         definition specifies ``2048`` vector dimensions and measures
         similarity using ``dotProduct`` function. 

         .. tabs:: 

            .. tab:: Basic Example
               :tabid: basic

               The following index definition indexes only the vector
               embeddings field (``plot_embedding_voyage_3_large````) for performing vector search. 

               .. literalinclude:: /includes/avs/index-management/create-index/basic-example.go
                  :language: go

                  :linenos:

            .. tab:: Filter Example 
               :tabid: advanced

               This index definition indexes the following fields: 
      
               - A string field (``genres``) and a numeric field (``year``)
                 for pre-filtering the data.
               - The vector embeddings field (``plot_embedding_voyage_3_large````) for
                 performing vector search against pre-filtered data.

               .. literalinclude:: /includes/avs/index-management/create-index/filter-example.go
                  :language: go
                  :copyable: true
                  :emphasize-lines: 50-57
                  :linenos:

   .. step:: Run the following command to create the index.

      .. code-block:: shell

         go run create-index.go
