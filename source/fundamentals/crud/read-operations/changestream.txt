Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to monitor document changes by using a **change stream**.

A change stream outputs new change events, providing access to real-time data changes.
You can open a change stream on a collection, database, or client object.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the following ``Course`` struct as a model for documents
in the ``courses`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/changeStream.go
   :start-after: begin struct
   :end-before: end struct
   :language: go
   :dedent:

To run the examples in this guide, load these documents into the
``courses`` collection in the ``db`` database by using the following snippet:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/changeStream.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin insertDocs
   :end-before: end insertDocs

.. include:: /includes/fundamentals/automatic-db-coll-creation.rst

Each document contains a description of a university course that
includes the course title and maximum enrollment, corresponding to
the ``title`` and ``enrollment`` fields in each document.

.. note::

   Each example output shows truncated ``_data``, ``clusterTime``, and
   ``ObjectID`` values because the driver generates them uniquely.

Open a Change Stream
--------------------

To open a change stream, use the ``Watch()`` method. The ``Watch()`` method requires a context
parameter and a pipeline parameter. To return all changes, pass in an
empty ``Pipeline`` object.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example opens a change stream on the ``courses`` collection and
outputs all changes:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/changeStream.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin open stream
   :end-before: end open stream

If you modify the ``courses`` collection in a separate program or shell, this code prints
your changes as they occur. Inserting a document with a ``title`` value
of ``"Advanced Screenwriting"`` and an ``enrollment`` value of ``20``
results in the following change event:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   map[_id:map[_data:...] clusterTime: {...} documentKey:map[_id:ObjectID("...")]
   fullDocument:map[_id:ObjectID("...") enrollment:20 title:Advanced Screenwriting] ns:
   map[coll:courses db:db] operationType:insert]

Modify the Change Stream Output
-------------------------------

Use the pipeline parameter to modify the change stream output. This parameter allows you to
only watch for certain change events. Format the pipeline parameter as an array of documents,
with each document representing an aggregation stage.

You can use the following pipeline stages in this parameter:

- ``$addFields``
- ``$match``
- ``$project``
- ``$replaceRoot``
- ``$replaceWith``
- ``$redact``
- ``$set``
- ``$unset``

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example opens a change stream on the ``db`` database but only watches for
new delete operations:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/changeStream.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin delete events
   :end-before: end delete events

.. note::

   The ``Watch()`` method was called on the ``db`` database, so the code outputs
   new delete operations on any collection within this database.

Modify the Behavior of ``Watch()``
----------------------------------

Use the ``options`` parameter to modify the behavior of the ``Watch()`` method.

You can specify the following options for the ``Watch()`` method:

- ``ResumeAfter``
- ``StartAfter``
- ``FullDocument``
- ``FullDocumentBeforeChange``
- ``BatchSize``
- ``MaxAwaitTime``
- ``Collation``
- ``StartAtOperationTime``
- ``Comment``
- ``ShowExpandedEvents``
- ``StartAtOperationTime``
- ``Custom``
- ``CustomPipeline``

For more information on these options, visit the
:manual:`MongoDB Server manual </reference/method/db.collection.watch/>`.

Pre- and Post-Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you perform any CRUD operation on a collection, by default, the
corresponding change event document contains only the delta of the fields modified
by the operation. You can see the full document before and after a
change, in addition to the delta, by specifying settings in the ``options``
parameter of the ``Watch()`` method.

If you want to see a document's post-image, the full version of the
document after a change, set the ``FullDocument`` field of the
``options`` parameter to one of the following values:

- ``UpdateLookup``: The change event document includes a copy of the
  entire changed document.
- ``WhenAvailable``: The change event document includes a post-image of
  the modified document for change events if the
  post-image is available.
- ``Required``: The output is the same as for ``WhenAvailable``, but the
  driver raises a server-side error if the post-image is not available.

If you want to see a document's pre-image, the full version of the
document before a change, set the ``FullDocumentBeforeChange`` field of the
``options`` parameter to one of the following values:

- ``WhenAvailable``: The change event document includes a pre-image of
  the modified document for change events if the
  pre-image is available.
- ``Required``: The output is the same as for ``WhenAvailable``, but the
  driver raises a server-side error if the pre-image is not available.

.. important::

   To access document pre- and post-images, you must enable
   ``changeStreamPreAndPostImages`` for the collection. See the
   :manual:`MongoDB Server manual
   </reference/command/collMod/#change-streams-with-document-pre--and-post-images>` for instructions and more
   information.

.. note::

   There is no pre-image for an inserted document and no post-image for
   a deleted document.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example calls the ``Watch()`` method on the ``courses`` collection. It
specifies a value for the ``FullDocument`` field of the ``options`` parameter to
output a copy of the entire modified document, instead of only the changed fields:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/changeStream.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin full document
   :end-before: end full document

Updating the ``enrollment`` value of the document with the
``title`` of ``"World Fiction"`` from ``35`` to ``30`` results in the
following change event:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   {"_id": {"_data": "..."},"operationType": "update","clusterTime": {"$timestamp":
   {"t":"...","i":"..."}},"fullDocument": {"_id":
   {"$oid":"..."},"title": "World Fiction","enrollment":
   {"$numberInt":"30"}}, "ns": {"db": "db","coll": "courses"},"documentKey": {"_id":
   {"$oid":"..."}}, "updateDescription": {"updatedFields": {"enrollment": {"$numberInt":"30"}},
   "removedFields": [],"truncatedArrays": []}}

Without specifying the ``FullDocument`` option, the same update operation no longer
outputs the ``"fullDocument"`` value in the change event document.
