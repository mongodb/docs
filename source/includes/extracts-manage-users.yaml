  To assign roles to any user in any group, you must have either the
  :ref:`Global User Admin <global-user-admin-role>` role or :ref:`Global
  Owner <global-owner-role>` role.

  You can assign roles either through |mms|, as described here, or
  :ref:`through an LDAP server <assign-roles-with-ldap>` after you have
  :doc:`set up LDAP integration
  </tutorial/configure-for-ldap-authentication>` and created LDAP groups
  for your |mms| roles.

  Assign |mms| Roles with LDAP
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  To assign roles through an LDAP server, you must :doc:`set up LDAP
  integration </tutorial/configure-for-ldap-authentication>` and create LDAP
  groups for your |mms| roles. You must also have the permissions described in
  :ref:`assign-roles-to-users`.

  For LDAP authentication, the welcome form includes the ability to assign
  LDAP groups to the |mms| group-level and global roles.

  1. :doc:`Configure LDAP authentication </tutorial/configure-for-ldap-authentication>`.

  2. Create groups on your LDAP server for each of the available |mms|
     group-level and global roles.

  To assign LDAP groups to |mms| roles:

  1. Click the :guilabel:`Admin` link at the top right of the |mms| page.

  2. Click :guilabel:`General` and then click :guilabel:`Groups`.

  3. Click the pencil icon at the far right of a group name. Edit the
     Roles interface by adding the appropriate LDAP group name to its
     corresponding |mms| group name.

  Because |mms| does not update role assignments stored in your LDAP server,
  assign roles by assigning users to groups in your LDAP server.

  Configure global roles in the ``conf-mms.properties`` :doc:`configuration
  file </reference/configuration>`.
