|service| can perform a live migration of a remote replica set to an
|service| cluster, keeping the cluster in sync with the remote source
until you cut your applications over to the |service| cluster.

|service| does not support live migrations from a remote sharded cluster.

Considerations
--------------

MongoDB Users and Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| does not migrate any user or role data to the destination cluster.

Create the appropriate users on the |service| cluster prior to starting the
procedure to ensure a seamless transition.

See :doc:`/security-add-mongodb-users` for a tutorial on creating MongoDB
users in |service|. If the available |service| MongoDB built-in roles are
not sufficient, please create a :ref:`support ticket <live-migration-support>`.

Supported Authentication Mechanism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| only supports :manual:`SCRAM-SHA-1 </core/security-scram-sha-1>` for
connecting to source clusters enforcing authentication.

If the source cluster uses a different authentication mechanism, please
create a please create a :ref:`support ticket <live-migration-support>`.

.. _live-import-ip-whitelist:

IP Whitelisting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Source Cluster IP Whitelist
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Add the following |service| IP ranges to the source cluster's whitelist or
firewall:

- ``4.71.186.128/25``
- ``4.35.16.128/25``

|service| Cluster IP Whitelist
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

|service| automatically adds the IP address of the source cluster to the
|service| group whitelist. You must add any additional IP addresses such as
application servers to the group whitelist manually. Do this before
beginning the migration procedure.

For documentation on adding entries to the |service| whitelist, see
:doc:`/security-whitelist`.

Cut Over Downtime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the destination |service| cluster is nearly in sync with the source
cluster, |service| prompts you to start the cut over process. You must stop
any applications that are accessing the source cluster to allow the
destination cluster to fully sync.

|service| starts an extendable 24 hour timer once the destination cluster is
ready for cut over. Take this time to schedule the cut over period during the
most appropriate time.

The |service| UI provides a timer for the approximate time remaining for sync
to complete. Use this timer to approximate the amount of downtime required
to perform the cut over, taking into consideration the time required to
update and restart your applications.

Destination Cluster Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When configuring the destination cluster, consider the following:

- If the region you deploy the destination cluster to is geographically
  distant from the source cluster, the latency may cause the migration
  timer to stay the same or increase. You may need to deploy the destination
  cluster in a region more geographically near to the source cluster.

- If the write workload on the source cluster is higher than what can be
  transferred and applied to the destination cluster, the migration timer may
  stay the same or increase. You may need to scale the destination cluster up
  to a instance with more processing power, bandwidth or disk IO.

- The destination |service| cluster can be either a replica set or a sharded
  cluster.

- You cannot select an ``M0`` (Free Tier) cluster as the destination for
  live migration.

Data Transfer Charges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| charges for data transfer between the |service| cluster and
another server. The migration procedure incurs data charges based on the
amount of data transferred from the source cluster to the |service| cluster.

For more information on data transfer charges, see :ref:`data-transfer-costs`.

Migration Support
-----------------

If you have any questions regarding migration support beyond what is covered
in this documentation, or if you encounter an error during migration, please
file a support ticket through the |service| UI.

To file a support ticket, you must:

#. Click :guilabel:`Support` in the left-hand navigation

#. For :guilabel:`Atlas Issue Category`, select ``Other``

#. For :guilabel:`Priority`, select the appropriate priority. For questions,
   please select ``Medium Priority``. If there was a failure in migration,
   please select ``High Priority``.

#. For :guilabel:`Request Summary`, please include ``Live Migration`` in the
   your summary.

#. For :guilabel:`More details`, please include any other relevant details to
   your question or migration error.
