title: "Review the cluster details."
content: |

  The |service| consoles displays the following for clusters in the
  selected project:

  - Metadata:

    .. include:: /includes/list-tables/per-project-cluster-list.rst

  - High-level :doc:`metrics </monitor-cluster-metrics/>`:

    - Read / write operations per second.

    - Number of open connections to the cluster.

    - Logical size of cluster data.

    - Cluster disk |iops| (*Available on M10+ clusters*).

  .. note::

     |service| pauses monitoring for these metrics on ``M0`` Free Tier
     clusters without connection activity for seven days. |service|
     indicates which clusters fell into this state in the
     :guilabel:`Cluster Detail` view. |service| limits details
     displayed for these clusters.

     To resume monitoring, make a successful connection to the cluster
     using:

     - The |service| |api|,
     - A :doc:`Driver </driver-connection>`,
     - The |mongo| shell, or
     - The :doc:`Data Explorer </data-explorer>`.
