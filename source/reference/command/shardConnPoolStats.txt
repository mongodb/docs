Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: shardConnPoolStats

   Returns information on the pooled and cached connections in the sharded
   connection pool. The command also returns information on the per-thread
   connection cache in the connection pool.

   The :dbcommand:`shardConnPoolStats` command uses the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { shardConnPoolStats: 1 }

   The sharded connection pool is specific to connections between members
   in a sharded cluster. The :program:`mongos` instances in a cluster use
   the connection pool to execute client reads and writes. The
   :program:`mongod` instances in a cluster use the pool when issuing
   :dbcommand:`mapReduce` to query temporary collections on other shards.

   When the cluster requires a connection, MongoDB pulls a connection from
   the sharded connection pool into the per-thread connection cache.
   MongoDB returns the connection to the connection pool after every
   operation.

Output
------

.. data:: shardConnPoolStats.hosts

   Displays connection status for each :term:`config server`,
   :term:`replica set`, and :term:`standalone instance <standalone>` in
   the cluster.

   .. data:: shardConnPoolStats.hosts.<host>.available

      The number of connections available for this host to connect to the
      :program:`mongos`.

   .. data:: shardConnPoolStats.hosts.<host>.created

      The number of connections the host has ever created to connect to
      the :program:`mongos`.

.. data:: shardConnPoolStats.replicaSets

   Displays information specific to replica sets.

   .. data:: shardConnPoolStats.replicaSets.<name>.host

      Holds an array of documents that report on each replica set member.
      These values derive from the :doc:`replica set status
      </reference/command/replSetGetStatus>` values.

      .. data:: shardConnPoolStats.replicaSets.<name>.host[n].addr

         The host address in the format ``[hostname]:[port]``.

      .. data:: shardConnPoolStats.replicaSets.<name>.host[n].ok

         This field is for internal use. Reports ``false`` when the
         :program:`mongos` either cannot connect to instance or received a
         connection exception or error.

      .. data:: shardConnPoolStats.replicaSets.<name>.host[n].ismaster

         The host is the replica set's :term:`primary` if this is set to ``true``.

      .. data:: shardConnPoolStats.replicaSets.<name>.host[n].hidden

         The host is a :term:`hidden member` of the replica set if this is
         set to ``true``.

      .. data:: shardConnPoolStats.replicaSets.<name>.host[n].secondary

         The host is a :term:`hidden member` of the replica set if this is
         set to ``true``.

         The host is a :term:`secondary` member of the replica set if this
         is set to ``true``.

      .. data:: shardConnPoolStats.replicaSets.<name>.host[n].pingTimeMillis

         The latency, in milliseconds, from the :program:`mongos` to this member.

      .. data:: shardConnPoolStats.replicaSets.<name>.host[n].tags

         The member has tags configured.

.. data:: shardConnPoolStats.createdByType

   The number connections in the cluster's connection pool.

   .. data:: shardConnPoolStats.createdByType.master

      The number of connections to a shard.

   .. data:: shardConnPoolStats.createdByType.set

      The number of connections to a replica set.

   .. data:: shardConnPoolStats.createdByType.sync

      The number of connections to the config database.

.. data:: shardConnPoolStats.totalAvailable

   The number of connections available from the :program:`mongos` to the
   config servers, replica sets, and standalone :program:`mongod`s in the
   cluster.

.. data:: shardConnPoolStats.totalCreated

   The number of connections the :program:`mongos` has ever created to
   other members of the cluster.

.. data:: shardConnPoolStats.threads

   Displays information on the per-thread connection cache.

   .. data:: shardConnPoolStats.threads.hosts

      Displays each incoming client connection. For a :program:`mongos`,
      this array field displays one document per incoming client thread.
      For a :program:`mongod`, the array displays one entry per incoming
      sharded :dbcommand:`mapReduce` client thread.

      .. data:: shardConnPoolStats.threads.hosts.host

         The host using the connection. The host can be a :term:`config
         server`, :term:`replica set`, or :term:`standalone instance
         <standalone>`.

      .. data:: shardConnPoolStats.threads.hosts.created

         The number of times the host pulled a connection from the pool.

      .. data:: shardConnPoolStats.threads.hosts.avail

         The thread's availability.

   .. data:: shardConnPoolStats.threads.seenNS

      The namespaces used on this connection thus far.
