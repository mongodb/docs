This page provides additional recommendations to improve the performance of
your {+avs+} queries.

Ensure Enough Memory 
--------------------

|hnsw| works efficiently when vector data is held in memory. You must
ensure that the data nodes have enough RAM to hold the vector data and
indexes. We recommend deploying separate :ref:`Search Nodes for workload
isolation <configure-search-nodes>` without data isolation, which
enables more efficient usage of memory for vector search use cases.

Warm up the Filesystem Cache  
----------------------------

When you perform vector search not using :ref:`dedicated Search Nodes 
<what-is-search-node>`, your queries initially perform random seeks on
disk as you traverse the |hnsw| graph and the 
vector values are read into memory. When using Search Nodes,
this cache warming typically only occurs in the event of an index rebuild, 
usually during scheduled maintenance windows. 

Avoid Indexing Vectors When Running Queries
-------------------------------------------

Vector embeddings consume computational resources during indexing. 
As a result, indexing and querying at the same time may cause resource 
bottlenecks. When performing an initial sync, ensure that your Search Node
CPU usage crashes back down to ~0%, indicating segments have been merged and 
flushed to disk, before issuing test queries.
