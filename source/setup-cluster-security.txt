Security Features and Setup
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb


|arrow| **Required Configurable Security Features.** You must set up
the following required security features:

- Whitelist
   |service| only allows client connections to the cluster from entries
   in the project's whitelist. To connect, you must add an entry to the
   whitelist. To set up the whitelist for the project, see
   :doc:`security-whitelist`.
   
   For |service| clusters deployed on :ref:`google-gcp` or :ref:`microsoft-azure`,
   add the IP addresses of your :abbr:`GCP (Google Cloud Platform)` or
   :abbr:`Azure (Microsoft Azure)` services to |service| project IP whitelist
   to grant those services access to the cluster.

- User Authentication/Authorization
   |service| requires clients to authenticate to access the clusters,
   i.e. the MongoDB databases. You must create MongoDB users to access
   the database. To set up MongoDB users to your clusters, see
   :doc:`security-add-mongodb-users`.
   
   To access clusters in a project, users must belong to that project.  
   Users can belong to multiple projects. See 
   :doc:`/tutorial/manage-users`.

|arrow| **Optional Security Feature.** |service| provides the following
optional security feature that you can set up:

- VPC Peering (AWS Only)
   |service| supports VPC peering with other AWS VPCs in the same
   region. To use VPC Peering, see :doc:`security-vpc-peering`.
   
- Two Factor Authentication
   |service| supports Two Factor Authentication (2FA) to help users control 
   access to their |service| accounts. To use 
   :abbr:`2FA (Two Factor Authentication)`, see 
   :doc:`security-two-factor-authentication`.

|arrow| **Non-configurable Security Features.** The following
non-configurable security features are inherent to |service|:

.. _security-tls:

- TLS/SSL
   |service| uses TLS/SSL to encrypt the connections to your databases.

.. _security-vpc:

- Virtual private cloud (VPC)
