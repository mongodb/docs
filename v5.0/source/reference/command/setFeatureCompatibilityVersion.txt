.. dbcommand:: setFeatureCompatibilityVersion

   Enables or disables the features that persist data incompatible with
   earlier versions of MongoDB. You can only issue the
   :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` against the ``admin``
   database.

.. warning::

   Enabling backwards-incompatible features can complicate the
   downgrade process since you must remove any persisted
   backwards-incompatible features before you downgrade.

   It is recommended that after upgrading, you allow your deployment to
   run without enabling backwards-incompatible features for a burn-in period 
   to ensure the likelihood of downgrade is minimal. When you are confident 
   that the likelihood of downgrade is minimal, enable these features.

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Syntax
------

The command takes the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( {
      setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: <version>,
      writeConcern: { wtimeout: <timeout> }
   } )

The values for the ``version`` are:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85

   * - Version
     - Description

   * - ``"5.0"``


     - *Available on MongoDB 5.0 Deployments*

       Enables the :ref:`5.0 features that persist data incompatible
       with MongoDB 4.4 <5.0-compatibility-enabled>`.

   * - ``"4.4"``
     - *Available on MongoDB 4.4 and 5.0 Deployments*

       Enables the 4.4 features that persist data incompatible
       with MongoDB 4.2.

   * - ``"4.2"``
     - *Available on MongoDB 4.4 Deployments*

       Disables the 4.4 features that persist data incompatible
       with MongoDB 4.2.

writeConcern
~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Optional*

The ``writeConcern`` specifies the write concern
:ref:`wc-wtimeout` value in milliseconds:

- The time period that the :term:`primary` waits for
  acknowledgment from the majority of the replica set members. If the
  acknowledgment is not received in the time period, the operation
  fails.

- Default is ``60000`` milliseconds. Use a longer time period if the
  :term:`secondary` members of the replica set have a delay that exceeds
  the :ref:`wc-wtimeout` default.

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/list-run-command-targets.rst

Behavior
--------

Conflicts with Background Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain background operations may prevent
execution of :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`. Use 
:dbcommand:`currentOp` to identify any ongoing operations.

Sync Failures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you trigger a :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` change during an 
initial sync, the sync may fail with an ``OplogOperationUnsupported`` error
message when replaying entries on the ``oplog`` application phase. The sync 
following this attempt succeeds because the operation phase no longer replays
the operation.

Default Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/list-table-featureCompatibilityVersion-defaults.rst

Idempotency
~~~~~~~~~~~

This command must perform writes to an internal system collection. If
for any reason the command does not complete successfully, you can
safely retry the command as the operation is idempotent.


Feature Compatibility in Arbiters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/arbiter-fcv.rst

For example, an arbiter in a MongoDB 5.0 cluster, has an fCV
value of 4.4.

Examples
--------

.. _view-fcv:

View FeatureCompatibilityVersion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` for a :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instance, run the following command on a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance:

.. note::

   The operation is undefined on the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances. For a
   sharded cluster that has access control enabled, to run the command
   against a member of the shard replica set, you must connect to the
   member as a :ref:`shard local user <shard-local-users>`.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

The output from this command will resemble one of the following,
depending on the current state of the :binary:`~bin.mongod`:

- If the deployment has the default ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, or
  if the :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command has run
  successfully against the deployment, the
  ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` has the form:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     "featureCompatibilityVersion" : {
        "version" : <version>
     }

- If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` is in a partially upgraded or downgraded
  state, the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` has the following form:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     "featureCompatibilityVersion" : {
        "version" : <version> ,
        "targetVersion" : <target version>
     }

  For instance, if a sharded cluster has a shard replica set that is
  read only when you run :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`
  command against the :binary:`~bin.mongos`, the command will fail, and the
  ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of the config servers will include
  the ``targetVersion`` field.

  Or if a replica set becomes read only while
  :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` is running, the command
  will fail, and the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of the replica set
  will include the ``targetVersion`` field as well.

.. _set-fcv:

Set Feature Compatibility Version on MongoDB 5.0 Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enable 5.0 Backwards Incompatible Features
``````````````````````````````````````````

To enable the :ref:`5.0 features that persist data incompatible with
MongoDB 4.4 <5.0-compatibility-enabled>`, set the feature compatibility
to ``"5.0"`` on the MongoDB 5.0 deployment:

.. note::

   Run the :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command against
   the ``admin`` database.

   .. include:: /includes/list-run-command-targets.rst

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "5.0" } )

Disable 5.0 Backwards Incompatible Features
```````````````````````````````````````````

To disable the :ref:`5.0 features that persist data incompatible with
MongoDB 4.4 <5.0-compatibility-enabled>`, set the feature compatibility
to ``"4.4"`` on the MongoDB 5.0 deployment:

.. note::

   Run the :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command against
   the ``admin`` database.

   .. include:: /includes/list-run-command-targets.rst

   - ``"4.4"`` featureCompatibilityVersion is supported on MongoDB
     4.4 and MongoDB 5.0 deployments only.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "4.4" } )

If run as part of the downgrade process from MongoDB 5.0 to MongoDB
4.4, you must also remove all persisted features that are
:ref:`incompatible <5.0-compatibility-enabled>` with 4.4. See the
appropriate downgrade procedures.


Set Write Concern Timeout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example sets the optional write concern :ref:`wc-wtimeout`
field to 5000 (5 seconds).

.. note::

   Run the :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command against
   the ``admin`` database.

   .. include:: /includes/list-run-command-targets.rst

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( {
      setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "5.0",
      writeConcern: { wtimeout: 5000 }
   } )
