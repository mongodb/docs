msgid "Encryption Process"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/security-encryption-at-rest.txt:37
msgid "If encryption is enabled, the default encryption mode that MongoDB Enterprise uses is the ``AES256-CBC`` (or 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard in Cipher Block Chaining mode) via OpenSSL. AES-256 uses a symmetric key; i.e. the same key to encrypt and decrypt text. MongoDB Enterprise also supports authenticated encryption ``AES256-GCM`` (or 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode). FIPS mode encryption is also available."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/security-encryption-at-rest.txt:47
msgid "If you use ``AES256-GCM`` authenticated encryption, do **not** make copies of your data files. ``AES256-GCM`` requires that every process use a unique counter block value with the key. If you use copied ``AES256-GCM`` encrypted data files to start a second :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances may use the duplicate counter block values, voiding confidentiality and integrity guarantees."
