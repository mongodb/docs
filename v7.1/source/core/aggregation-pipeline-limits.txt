Aggregation Pipeline Limits
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

Aggregation operations with the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command have the
following limitations.

Result Size Restrictions
------------------------

The :dbcommand:`aggregate` command can either return a cursor or store
the results in a collection. Each document in the result set is subject
to the 16 megabyte :limit:`BSON Document Size limit <BSON Document
Size>`. If any single document exceeds the :limit:`BSON Document Size
limit <BSON Document Size>`, the aggregation produces an error. The
limit only applies to the returned documents. During the pipeline
processing, the documents may exceed this size. The
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method returns a cursor by default.

.. _stage-restrictions:

Number of Stages Restrictions
-----------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 5.0

   MongoDB 5.0 limits the number of :ref:`aggregation pipeline stages
   <aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference>` allowed in a single 
   pipeline to 1000. 
   
   If an aggregation pipeline exceeds the stage limit before or after being parsed, 
   you receive an error.
