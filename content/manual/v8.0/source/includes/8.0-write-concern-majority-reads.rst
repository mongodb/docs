Starting in MongoDB 8.0, write operations that use the
:writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern return an
acknowledgment when the majority of replica set members have
written the oplog entry for the change. This improves the
performance of ``"majority"`` writes. In previous releases,
these operations would wait and return an acknowledgment after
the majority of replica set members applied the change.
