Welcome to the MongoDB {+version+} Manual! MongoDB is a
document database designed for ease of development
and scaling. 

The manual describes key concepts in MongoDB such as:

- The query API
- Operational and administrative references
- Tutorials and procedures

MongoDB offers both local and cloud-hosted deployment options:

- For locally hosted deployments, MongoDB offers both a *Community*
  and an *Enterprise* version of the database:

  - MongoDB Community is the {+source-available+} edition of MongoDB.

  - MongoDB Enterprise is available as part of the MongoDB Enterprise
    Advanced subscription and includes comprehensive support for your
    MongoDB deployment. MongoDB Enterprise also adds enterprise-focused
    features such as LDAP and Kerberos support, on-disk encryption,
    and auditing.

- `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_server>`__
  is a hosted MongoDB Enterprise service option in the cloud which 
  requires no installation overhead and offers a free tier to get 
  started.
