Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to create a {+qe+}-enabled collection and insert a
document with encrypted fields.

After you complete the steps in this guide, you should be able to create
an encrypted collection and insert a document with fields that are encrypted 
with your {+cmk-long+}.

Before You Start
----------------

:ref:`Create your {+qe+}-enabled application <qe-create-application>`
before creating an encrypted collection.

If you are using :ref:`{+manual-enc+}
<qe-fundamentals-manual-encryption>`, you must also create a unique
{+dek-long+} for each encrypted field in advance. For more information,
see :ref:`qe-reference-keys-key-vaults`.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Specify Fields to Encrypt

      To encrypt a field, add it to the {+enc-schema+}. To enable
      queries on a field, add the ``queries`` property. 
      
      Create the {+enc-schema+} as follows. This code sample encrypts
      both the ``ssn`` and ``billing`` fields, but only the ``ssn``
      field is queryable:

            This tutorial uses POJOs as data models
            to represent the document structure. To set up your application to

            To learn more about Java POJOs, see the `Plain Old Java Object
            wikipedia article <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object>`__.
            
            This tutorial uses the following POJOs:
            
            - ``Patient``
            - ``PatientRecord``
            - ``PatientBilling``
            
            You can view these classes in the `models package of the complete Java application
            <{+sample-app-url-qe+}/java/src/main/java/com/mongodb/tutorials/qe/models>`__.

            Add these POJO classes to your application. Then, create an instance
            of a ``Patient`` that describes a patient's personal information. Use
            the encrypted client to insert it into the ``patients`` collection,
