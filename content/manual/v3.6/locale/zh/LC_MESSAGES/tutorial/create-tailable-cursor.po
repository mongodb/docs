"By default, MongoDB will automatically close a cursor when the client has "
"exhausted all results in the cursor. However, for :doc:`capped collections "
"</core/capped-collections>` you may use a *Tailable Cursor* that remains "
"open after the client exhausts the results in the initial cursor. Tailable "
"cursors are conceptually equivalent to the ``tail`` Unix command with the "
"``-f`` option (i.e. with \"follow\" mode). After clients insert new "
"additional documents into a capped collection, the tailable cursor will "
"continue to retrieve documents."
