|service| Configuration Options
-------------------------------

Clusters on any tier can change to another tier. All of the remaining  options require an ``M10`` or larger cluster except for sharding. Sharding options require an ``M30`` or larger cluster.

You can change the following options of your |service| cluster:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 40 40
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Setting
     - Action
     - Limitations

   * - :ref:`Global Cluster Configuration <scale-cluster-global-config>`

     - Enable |global-write| for your cluster or change existing global
       cluster configurations.

     - After you enable |global-write| for a cluster, you can't disable
       them.

   * - :ref:`Cloud Provider & Region <scale-cluster-cloud-provider>`

     - Select a different provider to change the cloud provider for
       your dedicated clusters. Changing to a different provider
       changes the connection string to your new cluster.

       Consider scheduling a time to
       :ref:`update your applications with the new connection string <atlas-faq-migrate-providers>`
       to resume connectivity to the cluster. |service| migrates data
       to the new cluster.

     - Adding or moving a node to a region without the primary
       requires each newly migrated replica set member to perform an
       :manual:`initial sync </core/replica-set-sync>`

   * - :ref:`Deploy or Configure a multi-cloud, multi-region cluster <scale-cluster-region>`
     - Deploy or modify a multi-cloud, multi-region cluster.

     - None

   * - :ref:`Cluster Tier <scale-cluster-instance>`

     - Change the cluster tier.

     - If your cluster uses :ref:`NVMe storage <nvme-storage>`,
       |service| must perform an
       :manual:`initial sync </core/replica-set-sync>`.

   * - :ref:`Cluster Storage Options <create-cluster-storage>`

     - Change the storage options for the cluster tier.

       .. include:: /includes/autoscale-oplog.rst

     - Clusters using |nvme| storage have a fixed size for each cluster
       tier.

   * - :ref:`Cluster Autoscaling Options <cluster-autoscaling>`

     - Change the cluster's autoscaling options.

     - You can't set this feature on multi-cloud clusters at this time.

   * - :ref:`MongoDB Version <scale-cluster-version>`

     - Upgrade the major MongoDB version of the cluster.

     - You can't downgrade the MongoDB version.

   * - :ref:`Deploy a Sharded Cluster <scale-cluster-sharding>`

     - Upgrade a replica set to a sharded cluster.

     - You can't reverse this upgrade.

       |service| allows Sharded Clusters for ``M30`` or larger
       clusters.

   * - :ref:`Modify the Number of Shards <scale-cluster-shardNum>`

     - Set the number of shards for a sharded cluster.

     - Removing a shard takes some time. Any subsequent MongoDB
       configuration changes start after |service| removes the shard.

       |service| allows Sharded Clusters for ``M30`` or larger
       clusters.

   * - :ref:`Enable or Disable Backup <scale-cluster-backups>`

     - Enable or disable backups for the cluster.

     - |service| enables backups for M2 and M5 clusters automatically.
       You can't disable backup for clusters on those tiers.

   * - :ref:`Enable or Disable the Business Intelligence Connector <create-cluster-enable-bi>`

     - Enable or disable the |bic| for this cluster.

       .. include:: /includes/extracts/cluster-option-bi-cluster-requirements.rst

     - None

   * - :ref:`Manage your own encryption keys <scale-cluster-enable-encryption>`

     - Enable or disable using your own encryption keys with this
       cluster.

     - None

Click :ref:`Apply Changes <scale-cluster-payment>` when complete.

Considerations
--------------

Migration, Availability, and Performance Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Making changes to a cluster often requires migrating to new
servers and storage volumes. The time required for an
:term:`initial sync` and resynchronizing data across storage volumes
increases linearly with the amount of data in the cluster.

Tier migrations which require an :term:`initial sync`:

- Upgrades from a free or shared tier (``M0``, ``M2``, and ``M5``
  clusters) to a higher tier.

- Changes to :ref:`NVMe storage volumes <nvme-storage>`. NVMe clusters
  auto-scale to the next higher tier when 90% of the available storage
  space is consumed, and the migration requires an initial sync.

To maximize availability:

- For a replica set, |service| migrates one node at a time, starting
  with the secondary nodes first and then the primary.

- For a sharded cluster, |service| performs the migration of the shards
  independently of each other. For each shard (i.e. replica set),
  |service| migrates one node at a time, starting with the secondary
  nodes first and then the primary.

:manual:`Retryable writes </core/retryable-writes>` should prevent any
write errors during the election of a new primary. On average, an
election can take five seconds.

Migration can affect performance if your primary is already reaching
operational capacity: each newly migrated replica set node must
perform an :term:`initial sync` from the primary, adding to the
operational load. Migrations can also affect performance if
:manual:`read preferences </core/read-preference>` are set to read from
secondaries: the replica set is down one secondary during the
migration.

.. include:: /includes/fact-auto-index.rst

.. Note to writers: beginning in v20160712, a cluster tier change
.. with no disk change does not require an initial sync

Billing
~~~~~~~

As you modify your cluster, you can compare the costs of different
options before applying them. The :guilabel:`Cluster Overview` box
displays the cost of the selected configuration, excluding data
transfer.

.. important:: Free Tier

   Upgrading an ``M0`` Free Tier cluster to an ``M2`` or greater paid
   tier cluster starts billing for the cluster. See :doc:`billing` for
   complete documentation on |service| billing.

The following sections provide complete documentation for each of the
|service| cluster scaling configuration options.

Backup
~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-continuous-backup-transition.rst

.. warning::

   |service| deletes {+Old-Backup+}s snapshots when you:

   - Change from {+Old-Backup+}s to {+Cloud-Backup+}s and
     remain on the same MongoDB version.

   - Change from {+Old-Backup+}s to {+Cloud-Backup+}s and
     perform a major MongoDB version upgrade other than 4.0 to 4.2.
     For example, if you change from {+Old-Backup+}s to {+Cloud-Backup+}s while upgrading from 3.6 to 4.0, |service|
     deletes {+old-backup+}s.

.. _scale-cluster-open-dialog:

Open the :guilabel:`Editing Cluster` Dialog
-------------------------------------------

For the cluster you want to modify, click the ellipses :guilabel:`...`
icon, then select :guilabel:`Edit Configuration`.

Alternatively, if you are already viewing the specific cluster,
click the :guilabel:`Configuration` button.

For ``M0`` Free Tier clusters, you can also click the
:guilabel:`Upgrade` button for the cluster.

.. _scale-cluster-global-config:

Modify the :guilabel:`Global Cluster Configuration`
---------------------------------------------------

.. important::

   You can't disable |global-write| for a cluster once deployed.

You can enable global writes for your cluster or modify
existing global cluster configurations.

.. seealso::

   - :ref:`global-clusters`.
   - :ref:`create-new-global-write-cluster`.

.. _scale-cluster-region:
.. _scale-cluster-cloud-provider:

Modify the :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region`
----------------------------------------------

.. note:: Considerations

   .. include:: /includes/fact-modify-cloud-provider.rst

- To view the current cloud providers and regions for this cluster,
  select :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region`.

- To modify the cloud providers and regions applied to this cluster,
  follow the procedures on :ref:`deploy-across-multiple-regions`.

- To upgrade from an |service| free- or shared-tier cluster, select
  from the available cloud providers.

.. seealso::

   - :ref:`create-cluster-cloud-provider-region`.
   - :ref:`move-cluster`.

.. _scale-cluster-storage:
.. _scale-cluster-instance:

Modify the :guilabel:`Cluster Tier`
-----------------------------------

You can change the cluster tier, as well as the memory, storage,
and |iops| (speed) specifications for the selected cluster.

.. note:: Free and Shared-Tier Cluster Considerations

   - You can't downgrade an ``M10+`` cluster to an
     ``M0`` Free Tier or ``M2/M5`` Shared-Tier Starter instance size.

   - Changing the cluster tier from an ``M0`` Free Tier or ``M2/M5``
     Shared-Tier cluster to an ``M10`` or larger cluster tier requires
     downtime. To prevent data corruption, you should plan to halt
     write operations to your cluster for the duration of your upgrade.

Select your preferred cluster tier. The selected instance size dictates
the memory, storage, and |iops| specification for each data-bearing
server [#data-bearing]_ in the cluster.

.. seealso::


   :ref:`create-cluster-instance`. 

From the :guilabel:`Cluster Tier` section, you can also:

- :ref:`create-cluster-storage`

- :ref:`Configure Autoscaling Options <scale-cluster-autoscale>`

Modify :guilabel:`Additional Settings`
--------------------------------------

You can set the following options:

- :ref:`scale-cluster-version`
- :ref:`scale-cluster-backups`
- :ref:`scale-cluster-sharding`
- :ref:`scale-cluster-shardNum`
