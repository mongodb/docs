Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: applyOps

   Provides a way to apply entries from an
   :term:`oplog` created by :term:`replica set` members and
   :term:`master` instances in a master/:term:`slave`
   deployment. :dbcommand:`applyOps` is primarily an internal command
   to support sharding functionality.

   .. include:: /reference/command/applyOps-param.rst

   :dbcommand:`applyOps` has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { applyOps: [ <operations> ], preCondition: [ { ns: <namespace>, q: <query>, res: <result> } ] } )

   :dbcommand:`applyOps` applies oplog entries from the ``<operations>``
   array, to the :program:`mongod` instance. The ``preCondition`` array
   provides the ability to specify conditions that must be true in order
   to apply the oplog entry.

   You can specify as many ``preCondition`` sets as needed. If you
   specify the ``ns`` option, :dbcommand:`applyOps` will only apply
   oplog entries for the :term:`collection` described by that
   namespace. You may also specify a query in the ``q`` field with a
   corresponding expected result in the ``res`` field that must match
   in order to apply the oplog entry.
