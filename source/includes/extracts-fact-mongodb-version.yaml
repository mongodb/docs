   |service| supports :doc:`creating </tutorial/create-new-cluster>`
   ``M10+`` paid tier clusters with the following MongoDB versions:

   - MongoDB 3.6
   - MongoDB 4.0
   - MongoDB 4.2

   Clusters on tiers ``M0``, ``M2``, and ``M5`` only support MongoDB
   4.2.

   As new maintenance releases become available, |service| upgrades to
   these releases via a rolling process to maintain cluster
   availability.


   To learn more about how |service| handles end of life of major
   MongoDB versions, see :ref:`atlas-eol-upgrade`.

   You can upgrade an existing |service| cluster to a newer major
   MongoDB version, if available, when you
   :ref:`scale a cluster <scale-cluster-version>`. However, you
   cannot downgrade a cluster's MongoDB version.

   .. important::

      If your project contains a :ref:`custom role <mongodb-roles>`
      that uses actions introduced in a specific MongoDB version, you
      cannot create a cluster with a MongoDB version less than that
      version unless you delete the custom role.

   |service| always upgrades the cluster to the latest stable release
   of the specified version via a rolling process to maintain cluster
   availability.

   You cannot downgrade the cluster to an earlier MongoDB version.
