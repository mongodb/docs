A *replica set* in MongoDB is a group of :binary:`~bin.mongod` processes
that provide redundancy and high availability. The members of a
replica set are:

:ref:`replica-set-primary-member`.
   The primary receives all write operations.

:ref:`replica-set-secondary-members`.
   Secondaries replicate operations from the primary to maintain an
   identical data set. Secondaries may have additional configurations
   for special usage profiles. For example, secondaries may be
   :ref:`non-voting <replica-set-non-voting-members>` or
   :ref:`priority 0 <replica-set-secondary-only-members>`.

The minimum recommended configuration for a replica set is a three
member replica set with three data-bearing members: one :ref:`primary
<replica-set-primary-member>` and two :ref:`secondary
<replica-set-secondary-members>` members. In some circumstances (such
as you have a primary and a secondary but cost constraints prohibit
adding another secondary), you may choose to include an :ref:`arbiter
<replica-set-arbiters>`. An arbiter participates in :ref:`elections
<replica-set-elections>` but does not hold data (i.e. does not provide
data redundancy).

A replica set can have up to :ref:`50 members
<3.0-replica-sets-max-members>` but only 7 voting members.
