Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to run a :ref:`text search
<text-search-go>`. 

.. important::

   MongoDB text search is different than :atlas:`Atlas Search
   </atlas-search/>`.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the examples in this guide, load the sample data into the
``movies`` collection of the ``marvel`` database with the following
snippet:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/textSearch.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin insert docs
   :end-before: end insert docs

.. include:: /includes/fundamentals/automatic-db-coll-creation.rst

Each document contains the name and release year of the Marvel movie
that corresponds to the ``title`` and ``year`` fields.

.. include:: /includes/fundamentals/truncated-id.rst

Text Index
~~~~~~~~~~

You must create a **text index** before running a text search. A text
index specifies the string or string array field on which to run a text
search.

The examples in the following sections run text searches on the
``title`` field in the ``movies`` collection. To enable text searches on
the ``title`` field, create a text index with the following snippet: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/textSearch.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin text index
   :end-before: end text index

.. _text-search-go:

Text Search
-----------

A text search retrieves documents that contain a **term** or a
**phrase** in the text indexed fields. A term is a sequence of
characters that excludes whitespace characters. A phrase is a sequence
of terms with any number of whitespace characters.

To perform a text search, use the ``$text`` evaluation query operator,
followed by the ``$search`` field in your query filter. The ``$text`` operator
performs a text search on the text indexed fields. The ``$search`` field
specifies the text to search in the text indexed fields.

Query filters for text searches use the following format:

.. code-block:: go

   filter := bson.D{{"$text", bson.D{{"$search", "<text to search>"}}}}

.. _term-search-go:

Search by a Term
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To search for a term, specify the term as a string in your query filter.
To search for multiple terms, separate each term with spaces in the string.

.. note::

   When searching for multiple terms, the ``Find()`` function returns
   documents with at least one of the terms in text indexed fields.

Example
```````

The following example runs a text search for titles that contain the term "War":

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/textSearch.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin term search
   :end-before: end term search

After running this example, the output resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   [{_id ObjectID("...")} {title Avengers: Infinity War} {year 2018}]
   [{_id ObjectID("...")} {title Captain America: Civil War} {year 2016}]

Search by a Phrase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To search for a phrase, specify the phrase with escaped quotes as a
string in your query filter. If you don't add escaped quotes around the
phrase, the ``Find()`` function runs a :ref:`term search <term-search-go>`.

.. tip::

   Escaped quotes are a backslash character followed by a double quote
   character.

Example
```````

The following example runs a text search for titles that contain the
phrase "Infinity War":

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/textSearch.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin phrase search
   :end-before: end phrase search

After running this example, the output resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   [{_id ObjectID("...")} {title Avengers: Infinity War} {year 2018}]

Search with Terms Excluded
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each term or phrase you want to exclude from your text search,
specify the term or phrase prefixed with a minus sign as a string in
your query filter.

.. important::

   You must search for at least one term if you want to exclude
   terms from your search. If you don't search for any terms, the
   ``Find()`` function doesn't return any documents.

Example
```````

The following example runs a text search for titles that contain the
term "Avenger", but does not contain the phrase "Captain America":

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/textSearch.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin exclude term search
   :end-before: end exclude term search

After running this example, the output resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   [{_id ObjectID("...")} {title The Avengers} {year 2012}]
   [{_id ObjectID("...")} {title Avengers: Infinity War} {year 2018}]

Sort by Relevance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A text search assigns a numerical text score to indicate how closely
each result matches the string in your query filter. To reveal the text
score in your output, use a projection to retrieve the ``textScore``
metadata. You can sort the text score in descending order by specifying
a sort on the ``textScore`` metadata.

Example
```````

The following example performs the following actions:

- Runs a text search for titles that contain the term "Avenger"
- Sorts the results in descending order based on their text score
- Includes the ``title`` and ``score`` fields from the results

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/textSearch.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin text score
   :end-before: end text score

After running this example, the output resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   [{title The Avengers} {score 1}]
   [{title Avengers: Infinity War} {score 0.6666666666666666}]
   [{title Captain America: The First Avenger} {score 0.625}]

.. tip::

   Although the search term was "Avenger", the function also matches
   titles containing "Avengers" because a MongoDB text index uses suffix
   stemming to match similar words. For more information about how
   MongoDB matches terms, see :manual:`Index Entries
   </core/index-text/#index-entries>`.

Aggregation
-----------

You can also include the ``$text`` evaluation query operator in the
:manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>` stage to
perform a text search in an aggregation pipeline.

Term Search Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example runs a text search for titles that contain the term "Winter":

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/textSearch.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin aggregate text search
   :end-before: end aggregate text search

After running this example, the output resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   [{_id ObjectID("...")} {title Captain America: The Winter Soldier} {year 2014}]

Text Score Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example performs the following actions:

- Runs a text search for titles that contain the term "Avenger"
- Sorts the results in descending order based on their text score
- Includes the ``title`` and ``score`` fields from the results

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/textSearch.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin aggregate text score
   :end-before: end aggregate text score

After running this example, the output resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   [{title The Avengers} {score 1}]
   [{title Avengers: Infinity War} {score 0.6666666666666666}]
   [{title Captain America: The First Avenger} {score 0.625}]

.. tip::

   Although the search term was "Avenger", the function also matches
   titles containing "Avengers" because a MongoDB text index uses suffix
   stemming to match similar words. For more information about how
   MongoDB matches terms, see :manual:`Index Entries
   </core/index-text/#index-entries>`.
