  The operation returns a :method:`WriteResult` object with the status
  of the operation.

  The insert operation returns a :method:`WriteResult` object which
  contains the status of the operation. A successful insert of the
  document returns the following object:
action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
     WriteResult({ "nInserted" : 1 })
post: |
  The :data:`~WriteResult.nInserted` field specifies the number of
  documents inserted. If the operation encounters an error, the
  :method:`WriteResult` object will contain the error information.

  The returned document shows that MongoDB added an ``_id`` field to
  the document. If a client inserts a document that does not contain
  the ``_id`` field, MongoDB adds the field with the value set to a
  generated :doc:`/reference/object-id`. Your document's
  :doc:`/reference/object-id` will differ from the one shown.

  Although the :program:`mongo` shell displays the ``Date`` object
  using the shell wrapper ``ISODate()``, the object remains of type
  ``Date``.
