  Use the tabs at the top of the screen to select your 
  {+database-deployment+} type. You can deploy the following 
  {+database-deployments+} from this page:

  Shared Clusters
    Shared clusters include the ``M0``, ``M2``, and ``M5`` tiers.
    These low-cost cluster types are suitable for teams who are
    learning MongoDB or developing small proof-of-concept applications.
    You can begin your project with a shared cluster and upgrade to a
    production-ready tier at a future time.

  Dedicated Clusters
    Dedicated clusters include ``M10`` and higher tiers. The
    ``M10`` and ``M20`` tiers are suitable for development environments
    and low-traffic applications, while higher tiers can handle large
    datasets and high-traffic applications. Dedicated clusters can be
    deployed into a single geographical region or multiple geographical regions.

  {+Serverless-Instances+}
    {+Serverless-instances+} require minimal configuration and are best for
    applications that aren't critical and experience low or variable traffic. To learn
    more about {+serverless-instances+}, see :ref:`Choose a
    {+Database-Deployment+} Type <ref-deployment-types>`.

  To create a {+serverless-instance+}, see 
  :doc:`Create a New {+Serverless-Instance+} </tutorial/create-serverless-instance>` 
  for next steps.

  Select either an ``M10`` {+dedicated-cluster+} or an ``M0`` 
  {+free-cluster+} type from the available preset templates. You can
  also deploy a {+serverless-instance+} from this page.

  The choice of cloud provider and region affects the configuration
  options for the available cluster tiers, network latency for clients
  accessing your cluster, the geographic location of the nodes in your
  cluster, and the :doc:`cost of running the cluster </billing>`.

  To learn more, see :ref:`create-cluster-cloud-provider-region`.

  From the :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region` section, you can also
  choose to deploy your cluster across multiple regions. Multi-region
  clusters can better withstand data center outages and may contain
  dedicated geographic regions for localized reads, thereby improving
  performance. To learn how to deploy a multi-region cluster, see
  :ref:`create-cluster-multi-region`.

  To deploy your {+cluster+} across multiple regions, you must select
