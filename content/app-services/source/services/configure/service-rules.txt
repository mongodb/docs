Overview
--------

In order to call a service action, you must first define a :ref:`service
rule <service-rules>` that enables and configures the capabilities of
the action. You can define service rules from the Atlas App Services UI or by
:ref:`importing <deploy-cli>` a service
configuration directory that contains a rule configuration file. Select
the tab below that corresponds to the method you want to use.

Procedure

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Create a New Rule

            You can create and configure a service rule from its associated
            :doc:`service </reference/services>` page in the App Services UI.

            To define a new service rule:

            1. Click :guilabel:`Services` in the left navigation menu.

            2. Click on the service that you want to specify a rule for.

            3. Click on the :guilabel:`Rules` tab of the service.

            4. Click :guilabel:`New Rule`.

            5. Specify a name for the rule in the textbox that appears.

            6. Click :guilabel:`Add Rule` to confirm the creation of the new rule.


         .. step:: Configure the Rule

            To configure the new service rule you just created:

            1. Click on the newly created rule in the rules list on the left-hand
               side of the page.

            2. In the list of :guilabel:`Actions`, select all of the actions that
               you want the rule to apply to.

            3. For the :guilabel:`When` box, specify a :ref:`rule expression
               <expressions>` that evaluates to ``true`` when you want the action to be
               permitted.

               .. note::

                  If you specify ``{}``, the expression will always evaluate to
                  ``true`` and App Services will always allow the associated actions to
                  be called.

         .. step:: Save the Configured Rule

            Once you've finished configuring the rule, click :guilabel:`Save`.
            Once saved, the rule takes effect immediately.

   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli
      
      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Pull Your App's Latest Configuration Files

            .. code-block:: shell

               realm-cli pull --remote=<App ID>


         .. step:: Create a Service Rule Directory

            If it doesn't already exist, create a new ``rules`` subdirectory in
            the ``/services`` folder of the exported directory.

            .. code-block:: shell

               mkdir -p services/<service name>/rules


         .. step:: Create and Configure a New Service Rule

            Add a rule configuration JSON file to the ``rules`` directory. The
            configuraiton file should have the same name as the rule and have the
            following form:

            .. code-block:: json

               {
                 "name": <string>,
                 "actions": [<action>, ...],
                 "when": <JSON expression>
               }

            .. list-table::
               :header-rows: 1
               :widths: 10 30

               * - Configuration Value
                 - Description

               * - | :guilabel:`Rule Name`
                   | *name*

                 - Required. A name for the rule. The name should be unique
                   within the service.

               * - | :guilabel:`Actions`
                   | *actions*

                 - Required. An array of strings where each item is the name of
                   a service action that the rule applies to.

                   .. example::

                      An HTTP service rule that only applies to the
                      :doc:`http.post()
                      </services/http-actions/http.post>` service
                      action would have the following ``action`` value:

                      .. code-block:: json

                        "actions": [
                          "post"
                        ]

               * - | :guilabel:`When`
                   | *when*

                 - Required. A :ref:`rule expression <expressions>` that determines if a
                   service action should actually execute after being called. App Services
                   will only execute the action if the expression resolves to ``true``. If
                   you do not specify an expression, :guilabel:`Can Evaluate` defaults to
                   ``true``.


         .. step:: Deploy the Rule

            Push the rule configuration to deploy it to your app. Once you have deployed,
            App Services immediately begins to enforce the rule.

            .. code-block:: shell

               realm-cli push
