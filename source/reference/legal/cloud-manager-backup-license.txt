This is a human-readable summary of some of the key terms of the full
agreement. It has *no legal value*. You should carefully review all
terms of the
:ref:`actual license <cm_backup_license>`
before agreeing.

Who Needs this License?
-----------------------

This :ref:`new license <cm_backup_license>`
is available only to customers who:

1. Are currently paying for a Cloud Manager Backup subscription but do
   not have a MongoDB Enterprise Server subscription, and

2. Want to upgrade to MongoDB 4.2 or later.

What Does this License Allow?
-----------------------------

The agreement grants you a
:ref:`license <cm_backup_license>` to
install and use the backup features of the MongoDB 4.2 Enterprise
Server *only during the term of your Cloud Manager Backup
subscription*.

The license allows you to use the Enterprise backup features. It does
not grant you rights to use any other features of the MongoDB
Enterprise Server.

If you would like to access and use all of the features of the MongoDB
Enterprise Server, please download the
:website:`MongoDB Enterprise Advanced Datasheet </collateral/value-mongodb-subscriptions-datasheet>`
for more information or :contact:`contact us </>` for
pricing details.

How Can I Use MongoDB 4.2 Enterprise for Backups?
-------------------------------------------------

If you are paying for Cloud Manager Backup, you can:

1. Upgrade to MongoDB 4.2 Enterprise or later; and
2. Review and accept the terms of the new license in the Cloud Manager
   console.

Why Is MongoDB Offering this License?
-------------------------------------

MongoDB is offering this upgrade path and license to customers who use
Cloud Manager Backup because:

- MongoDB enhanced the backup process of the core server.
- These enhancements are unavailable in the MongoDB Community Server.

When Do I Need to Upgrade to MongoDB Enterprise?
------------------------------------------------

If you want to use MongoDB 4.2 for your clusters, you *must* follow
this :doc:`new upgrade path </tutorial/change-mongodb-version>`.
You cannot back up MongoDB 4.2 databases using Cloud Manager Backup
with MongoDB 4.2 Community Server.

   that provision will be enforced to the extent permissible by law and
   the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. No
   waiver under this Agreement shall be valid or binding unless set
   forth in writing and duly executed by the party against whom
   enforcement of such waiver is sought. Any such waiver shall
   constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter
   described therein and shall in no way impair the rights of the party
   granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. Any
   delay or forbearance by either party in exercising any right
   hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver of that right. This Agreement
   is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between us
   and supersedes any proposal or prior agreement, oral or written, and
   any other communications between You and Company in relation to the
   subject matter of this Agreement.
