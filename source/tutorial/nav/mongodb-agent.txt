Previous to introducing the {+mdbagent+}, each function -- Automation,
Backup, and Monitoring -- ran as a separate agent binary in your
project.

The {+mdbagent+} runs as a single binary that can perform all three
functions when you choose to enable them. You can choose to activate
the monitoring and backup functions of the {+mdbagent+}. You can
activate automation when you create a new cluster or import an existing
one.
