|service| supports :wikipedia:`Network Peering
</Virtual_private_cloud>` connections for |aws|, |gcp|, and
|azure|-backed clusters.

.. important::

   To set up a Network Peering connection, you must have either the
   :authrole:`Project Owner` or :authrole:`Organization Owner` role.

Configure an |service| Network Peering Connection
-------------------------------------------------

To configure |service| Network Peering for a cluster, perform the
procedure on the tab corresponding to your cluster's cloud provider.
You also configure the |service| |vpc| |cidr| during this procedure.

To configure the |service| |cidr| without configuring Network Peering,
see :doc:`Create a New Network Peering Container </reference/api/vpc-create-container>`.
You must use the |api| to configure the |service| |cidr| without
Network Peering.

         1. In the :guilabel:`Security` section of the left navigation,
            click :guilabel:`Network Access`.

         #. In the :guilabel:`Peering` tab, click :icon-fa5:`plus`
            :guilabel:`Add Peering Connection`.

         #. Enable :guilabel:`DNS hostnames` and :guilabel:`DNS resolution` in |aws|:

            a. Log in to your |aws| account.

            #. Go to the
               `VPC dashboard <https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc>`_.

            #. Open your list of |vpc| resources.

            #. Select the |vpc| you want to peer with.

            #. Enable :guilabel:`DNS hostnames` and :guilabel:`DNS
               resolution` to ensure that the cluster's hostnames in standard connection strings automatically resolve to private instead of public IP addresses when the |service| cluster is accessed from within the :ref:`VPC <security-vpc>`. 
               
               If :guilabel:`DNS hostnames` and :guilabel:`DNS resolution` are disabled 
               and the :ref:`VPC <security-vpc>` is accessible to the internet, the |dns| 
               resolves the cluster's hostnames to their public |ipaddr| address rather than their internal |ipaddr| address. 
               
               To learn more about how to enable these options, see :aws:`Updating DNS Support for Your VPC </AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-dns.html#vpc-dns-updating>`.

               .. note:: 

                  If the applications deployed within |aws| use custom |dns| services and :ref:`VPC <security-vpc>` peering with |service|, see :ref:`FAQ <atlas-faq-custom-dns>` for more information on how to connect using private connection strings.

         #.  Go to :guilabel:`Network Access` view in |service|.

             In the :guilabel:`Security` section of the left
             navigation, click :guilabel:`Network Access`.

         #. Click the :guilabel:`Peering` tab.

         #. Click :guilabel:`Add Peering Connection`.

                   You can choose to add the |vpc| |cidr| block address

         #. Wait for approval of peering connection request

            The owner of the peer |vpc| must approve the |vpc| peering
            connection request. Ensure that the owner approves the
            request.

               Once set up, you can edit or terminate |vpc| peering
               connection from the :guilabel:`Peering` table.

               You must add your |vpc| |cidr| block address (or subset)
               or the Security Group associated with the peer |vpc| to
