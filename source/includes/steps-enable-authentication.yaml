  Start the :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` instance with the
   :setting:`auth` or :setting:`keyFile` setting. Use :setting:`auth`
   on a standalone instance. Use :setting:`keyFile` on an instance in a
   :term:`replica set` or :term:`sharded cluster`.

  and grant further access to the instance by creating additional
  users.
