Overview
--------

When access control is enabled, every user must be authenticated on the
MongoDB process. If access control is disabled, any client can access
any database and perform any action in your deployments.

Once authenticated, users only have privileges granted to the their
roles. This type of authorization is called role-based access control
(RBAC). Privileges are assigned to roles and roles are assigned to
users.

When you enable MongoDB select an Authentication Mechanism for your
group, this enables access control for all the deployments in your
|mms| group. The group shares one set of users for all deployments, but
each user only has authorization for specific resources.

Access control applies to both |mms| agents and clients. When you
enable access control, |mms| automatically creates the appropriate
users for the agents.

Considerations
--------------

Once you enable access control, you must :doc:`create MongoDB users </tutorial/manage-mongodb-users>`
so that clients can access your databases.

.. recommendation::
   To avoid inconsistencies, use the |mms| interface to manage users
   and roles for MongoDB deployments.

When you enable access control, |mms| creates a user with global
privileges for the Automation Agent. If |mms| manages the Monitoring
and Backup Agents, |mms| also creates users for them with more limited
privileges. The first user you create can be any type of user, as the
Automation Agent guarantees you always have access to user management.

For more information on MongoDB access control, see the
:manual:`Authentication </core/authentication>` and 
:manual:`Authorization </core/authorization>` pages in the 
MongoDB manual.

Enable MongoDB Access Control
-----------------------------

|mms| supports various authentication mechanisms. You can choose any or
all mechanisms you wish to use when you enable access control.

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-access-control.rst

:guilabel:`Username/Password` authentication is the only mechanism available in |mms| when using the MongoDB Community version.

See :doc:`/tutorial/nav/security-enable-authentication` for detailed
instructions for configuring the different authentication mechanisms.

Next Steps
----------

See :doc:`/tutorial/manage-mongodb-users` to create MongoDB users and
roles and assign privileges to those roles.
