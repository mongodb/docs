==================
cursor.maxTimeMS()
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Definition
----------

.. versionadded:: 2.5.4

.. method:: cursor.maxTimeMS(<time limit>)

   Specifies a cumulative time limit in milliseconds for processing
   operations on a cursor.

   The :method:`~cursor.maxTimeMS()` method has the following
   parameter:

   .. include:: /reference/method/cursor.maxTimeMS-param.rst

.. important::

   :method:`~cursor.maxTimeMS()` is not related to the
   ``NoCursorTimeout`` query flag. :method:`~cursor.maxTimeMS()`
   relates to processing time, while ``NoCursorTimeout`` relates
   to idle time. A cursor's idle time does not contribute towards its
   processing time.

Behaviors
---------

MongoDB targets operations for termination if the associated cursor
exceeds its allotted time limit. MongoDB only terminates an operation
at one of its designated interrupt points.

MongoDB does not count network latency towards a cursor's time limit.

Queries that generate multiple batches of results continue to return
batches until the cursor exceeds its allotted time limit.

Examples
--------

.. example:: The following query specifies a time limit of 50 milliseconds:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find({description: /August [0-9]+, 1969/}).maxTimeMS(50)
