====================
$limit (aggregation)
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

.. pipeline:: $limit

   Restricts the number of :term:`documents <document>` that
   pass through the :pipeline:`$limit` in the :term:`pipeline`.

   :pipeline:`$limit` takes a single numeric (positive whole number)
   value as a parameter. Once the specified number of documents pass
   through the pipeline operator, no more will. Consider the following
   example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.article.aggregate(
          { $limit : 5 }
      );

   This operation returns only the first 5 documents passed to it from
   by the pipeline. :pipeline:`$limit` has no effect on the content
   of the documents it passes.
