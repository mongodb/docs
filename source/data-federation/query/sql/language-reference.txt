This page outlines the syntax and semantics of {+asql+},
a SQL dialect designed to provide first-class support for
working with MongoDB's flexible document model.
This page lists and describes supported clauses, operators, expressions, and functions.

.. _sql-limitations:

Compatibility and Limitations
-----------------------------

- {+asql+} is based on the SQL-92 standard.
  However {+asql+} is not fully SQL-92 compatible due to the following limitations:

  - The ``UNION`` function is not supported. However, ``UNION ALL`` is supported.
  - The ``date`` data type is not supported. Use ``timestamp`` instead.
  - ``SELECT DISTINCT`` is not supported.
  - Interval and date interval arithmetic are not supported.

- {+asql+} does not support {+avs+} and |fts|.

Type System
-----------

.. _asql-data-types:

Data Types
~~~~~~~~~~

{+asql+} data types are the set of `BSON types <https://bsonspec.org/spec.html>`_.
All of these types can be queried in {+asql+}. They are:

- String (``STRING``)
- Document (``DOCUMENT``)
- Array (``ARRAY``)
- BinData (``BINDATA``)
- ObjectId (``OBJECTID``)
- Boolean (``BOOL``)
- Date (``TIMESTAMP``)
- Null (``NULL``)
- Regex (``REGEX``)
- 32-bit integer (``INT``)
- Double (``DOUBLE``)
- Long (``LONG``)
- Timestamp (``BSON_TIMESTAMP``)
- Decimal (``DECIMAL``)
- MinKey (``MINKEY``)
- MaxKey (``MAXKEY``)
- DBPointer (``DBPOINTER``)
- Symbol (``SYMBOL``)
- Javascript with scope (``JAVASCRIPTWITHSCOPE``)
- JavaScript (``JAVASCRIPT``)

Each type in {+asql+} has a name (in parentheses above), which is a keyword that can be used to
reference the type when necessary, such as in an expression like ``CAST``.

Type Conversions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Explicit type conversions are expressed via the ``CAST`` function or the ``::`` operator.
Numeric types are all mutually comparable;
{+asql+} allows operations between the various numeric types without casting the operands to be the same numeric type.

.. _asql-schema-type-constraint:

Schemas
~~~~~~~~~~

{+asql+} converts MongoDB's flexible document values into types using a schema.
An {+asql+} :ref:`schema <sql-schema-management>` is a collection of facts about an expression or
collection that are known to be true at compile time.

For example, an {+asql+} schema might dictate that
an expression is either a boolean or a document with subfields,
or that an expression is either an array with a length of one or a positive integer.

If a static type constraint is not satisfied, the query will fail to compile.

Clauses
-------

{+asql+} queries support a basic set of SQL clauses.
The available clauses are:

| ``SELECT``
| ``FROM``
| ``WHERE``
| ``GROUP BY``
| ``HAVING``
| ``ORDER BY``
| ``OFFSET``
| ``LIMIT``

SELECT
~~~~~~

``SELECT`` begins every Atlas SQL query.
{+asql+} allows ``SELECT VALUE`` and ``SELECT VALUES`` to be used interchangeably.

{+asql+} requires nested ``SELECT`` statements to have an alias.

.. code-block:: none

   SELECT foo FROM (SELECT bar FROM baz) as subSelect

CAST() 
``````

{+asql+} supports the ``CAST()`` funtion, which allows you to dynamically 
convert values in your query to a given data type.

.. code-block:: none

   SELECT * FROM table WHERE period_start_utc >= CAST('2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z' AS TIMESTAMP)

.. _from-clause:

FROM
~~~~

``FROM`` is the first clause evaluated in every {+asql+} query.

``FROM`` can pull data from various sources including collections 
``(SELECT * FROM foo)``, arrays ``(SELECT * FROM [{'a': 1}])``, joins 
``(SELECT * FROM a JOIN b)``, derived tables 
``(SELECT * FROM (SELECT a FROM foo) d)``, and :ref:`FLATTEN and UNWIND 
<asql-flatten-and-unwind>`.
  
.. _asql-where-clause:

WHERE
~~~~~

The ``WHERE`` clause is a filter on incoming data.
Its expression must statically have type ``BOOL`` or ``NULL`` and may 
evaluate to ``MISSING``.

.. _asql-group-by-clause:

GROUP BY
~~~~~~~~

``GROUP BY`` provides a means for grouping and aggregating data.

If using ``GROUP BY`` on a field that has been flattened using :ref:`FLATTEN or UNWIND <asql-flatten-and-unwind>`,
an alias is required.

.. code-block:: none
     
   SELECT customerAge, COUNT(*) FROM Sales GROUP BY customer.age AS customerAge

.. _asql-agg-funcs:

Aggregation Functions
`````````````````````
{+asql+} supports the following aggregation functions.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Description
     - Notes
   * - ``ADD_TO_ARRAY``
     - Pushes the argument to the end of an array.
       The total output of this function will be an array.
     - The argument to ``ADD_TO_ARRAY`` can have any type.
   * - ``ADD_TO_SET``
     - Pushes the argument to the end of an array removing duplicates.
       The total output of this function will be an array with all duplicate items removed.
       Duplicates are determined using the ``=`` operator.
     - The argument to ``ADD_TO_SET`` can have any type.
   * - ``AVG``
     - Returns the average of all the arguments.
     - The argument must be statically typed to a numeric type.
   * - ``COUNT``
     - Counts the number of elements.
       ``COUNT(*)`` counts all values unconditionally.
       ``COUNT(<expression>)`` counts all values for which the expression does not result in ``NULL`` or ``MISSING``.
     - The argument to ``COUNT`` can have any type.
   * - ``FIRST``
     - Returns the first element in the group.
     - Deterministic only when the input has deterministic order, otherwise undefined.
   * - ``LAST``
     - Returns the first element in the group.
       Deterministic only when the input has deterministic order, otherwise undefined.
     - The argument to ``LAST`` can have any type.
   * - ``MAX``
     - Returns the maximum element as ordered by the {+asql+} ``>`` operator.
     - The argument must be statically typed to be comparable via the ``>`` operator.
   * - ``MERGE_DOCUMENTS``
     - Returns a document formed by successively merging documents,
       with the previous element used as the left hand side.
       In the case of duplicate keys, the value of the key in the new element is kept.
       As with ``FIRST`` and ``LAST``,
       the output is only deterministic when the input has deterministic ordering.
     - The argument must be statically typed as ``DOCUMENT``,
       and thus ``MERGE_DOCUMENTS(DISTINCT x)`` is not supported.
   * - ``MIN``
     - Returns the minimum element as ordered by the {+asql+} ``<`` operator.
     - The argument must be statically typed to be comparable via the ``<`` operator.
   * - ``STDDEV_POP``
     - Returns the standard deviation of all elements over the entire group population.
     - The argument must be statically typed to a numeric type.
       See :manual:`stdDevPop </reference/operator/aggregation/stdDevPop>`.
   * - ``STDDEV_SAMP``
     - Returns the standard deviation of a sample of all elements in the group.
       See :manual:`stdDevPop </reference/operator/aggregation/stdDevSamp>`.
     - The argument must be statically typed to a numeric type.
   * - ``SUM``
     - Returns the sum of all the arguments.
     - The argument must be statically typed to a numeric type.

HAVING
~~~~~~

The ``HAVING`` clause operates in the same way as a ``WHERE`` clause, but after the ``GROUP BY`` clause.
Like the ``WHERE`` clause, the ``HAVING`` clause takes an expression
that must statically have type ``BOOL`` or ``NULL`` and may evaluate to ``MISSING``.
It can reference aliases defined in the ``GROUP BY`` and can contain expressions with aggregation functions.
Only aliases defined in the ``GROUP BY`` are available to the ``HAVING`` clause.

ORDER BY
~~~~~~~~

The ``ORDER BY`` clause provides a way to order a result set by one or more sort keys.
Each sort key can be either a column reference,
or an integer literal referring to a ``SELECT`` expression by its position in the select expression list.
Sort keys that are column references can be compound identifiers.
These compound identifiers can be qualified with datasource names or refer to document subfields.

{+asql+} sorts ``MISSING`` before ``NULL``, and ``NULL`` before all other values.
The ``ORDER BY`` clause requires that all possible values in a sort key expression
can be statically verified to be comparable via the ``>`` (greater than)  and ``<`` (less than) operators.

LIMIT and OFFSET
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``LIMIT`` and ``OFFSET`` clauses allow users to retrieve only some of the rows returned by a query.
If a ``LIMIT`` number is provided, no more than that number of rows will be returned.
If an ``OFFSET`` number is provided, that number of rows is skipped before returning rows.

Both ``LIMIT`` and ``OFFSET`` numbers must be positive integers.
Using ``LIMIT`` or ``OFFSET`` without ``ORDER BY`` does not guarantee the same result.

When ``LIMIT`` and ``OFFSET`` are both set,
the ``OFFSET`` rows will be skipped before returning the rest of the results,
which should contain no more than the ``LIMIT`` number rows.

``LIMIT i, j`` is a shorter form of ``LIMIT i OFFSET j``.

``LIMIT`` and ``OFFSET`` can be used in subqueries.

Set operations
--------------

The ``UNION ALL`` set operator returns a single result set for two ``SELECT`` queries.
The ``UNION ALL`` operator does not remove duplicate rows from the result set.
The result set returned by the ``UNION ALL`` operator does not have a defined order.

{+asql+} does not support distinct ``UNION``, ``INTERSECT``, or ``EXCEPT`` set operations.

.. _asql-expressions:

Expressions
-----------

Identifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~

Identifiers in {+asql+} refer to databases, tables, and columns.
{+asql+} identifiers support all UTF-8 characters except the null character ``\x00``.

In {+asql+}, some identifiers are restricted to avoid conflicts
with characters that have other semantic meaning; for an identifier to include such a character, it must be *delimited*,
that is, surrounded by double quotes or backticks.
For example, an identifier must be delimited if it begins with a digit or if it conflicts with a reserved keyword
(e.g. ``"10cent"``).
Identifiers are case-sensitive, whether delimited or not.

.. _asql-aliases:

Aliases
~~~~~~~

Identifiers are used for all aliases in {+asql+}.
In most cases, {+asql+} returns an error if an alias is used more than once in the same clause.
The exception to this is that aliases can be repeated on both sides of a ``UNION ALL``.
This also applies to automatically generated aliases.

Keywords
~~~~~~~~

{+asql+} keywords (such as ``SELECT``, ``FROM``, ``JOIN``, etc.) cannot be used as undelimited identifiers.

Literals
~~~~~~~~

{+asql+} supports literals for booleans, null, numbers, and strings.
Strings are enclosed in single quotes.
To include a single quote character in a string literal, double it (``'o''clock'``).

Literal integers are typed as ``INT`` when within the 32-bit signed integer range and ``LONG`` otherwise.
Literal floating point numbers or scientific notation numbers have type ``DOUBLE``.

{+asql+} does not support literals for every type.
For example ``OBJECTID``, ``BSON_DATE``, and ``DECIMAL`` have no literal syntax.
For such types, pseudo-literal values can be obtained by using the ``CAST`` operator
to get from a string or numeric representation of those types to their respective type.
Some types may also have "constructor" functions which alias the relevant ``CAST`` invocations.

Parenthesized Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A parenthesized expression is an expression grouped by parentheses.
Any time infix operators are present, the need for parentheses (or a similar mechanism) to distinguish order of operations may be necessary.
{+asql+} has several infix operators, such as ``+`` and ``::``.
For example, the value of ``1 + 2 * 3`` is 7, while the value of ``(1 + 2) * 3`` is 9.

Operators
~~~~~~~~~

{+asql+} supports the following basic operators:

- ``+``
- ``-``
- ``*``
- ``/``
- ``||``
- ``<``
- ``<=``
- ``!=``
- ``==``
- ``>``
- ``>=``
- ``BETWEEN``
- ``AND``
- ``OR``
- ``NOT``

Subquery Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A subquery is a SQL query within a query.
You can use a subquery anywhere an expression can be used.

{+asql+} supports scalar subquery and table subquery.
A scalar subquery returns a result set with zero or one row and one column.
It can be used in most places a literal or single column value is valid.
A table subquery returns zero or more rows and one or more columns.

Document and Field-Access Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documents can be represented with a syntax similar to JSON objects.
Keys must be strings and values can have any of the :ref:`supported types <asql-data-types>`.
To access document fields, {+asql+} supports two options: "dot" notation and "bracket" notation.

Dot notation is similar to field access in MongoDB aggregation.
For example, if a document ``doc`` contains a field ``f``, then the expression ``doc.f`` is used to access the value of that field.
Bracket notation uses square brackets (``[`` and ``]``) around a field name to access the field with that name.
For example, consider the same document described before: ``doc["f"]`` is used to access the value of that field.

Null and Missing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BSON distinguishes between ``NULL`` and ``MISSING``.
In the case of ``NULL`` there is a field with the literal value ``NULL``,
whereas in the case of ``MISSING``, the field is gone.

Comments
--------

Comments are sequences of characters within queries that do not impact query execution.
{+asql+} supports both standard SQL comments and C-style block comments.

Standard SQL comments begin with double dashes and end with a new line:

.. code-block::
   :copyable: false

   \-- This is a standard SQL comment

Block comments begin with ``\*`` and end at the matching occurrence of ``*/``.

.. code-block::
   :copyable: false

   \* This is a
   multiline comment
