Requirements
------------

For production deployments, you should maintain as much separation between
members as possible by hosting the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances on separate machines. When using virtual machines for
production deployments, you should place each :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instance on a separate host server serviced by redundant power circuits
and redundant network paths.

Before you can deploy a replica set, you must install MongoDB on
each system that will be part of your :term:`replica set`.
If you have not already installed MongoDB, see the :ref:`installation tutorials <tutorial-installation>`.

Considerations When Deploying a Replica Set
-------------------------------------------

.. _deploy-replica-set-atlas:

Deploy a Replica Set in the {+atlas+} UI
------------------------------------------------

Replica sets in {+atlas+} are called clusters. The following procedure
creates a free cluster in the {+atlas+} UI with minimal
configuration. To learn more about all available options when you
create a cluster, see 
:atlas:`Create a Cluster </tutorial/create-new-cluster/>`. 

To create a cluster in the {+atlas+} UI, follow these steps:

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Open the Create New Database Deployment dialog box

      a. In the {+atlas+} UI, click :guilabel:`Database` in the sidebar.
      #. If you already have one or more database deployments, click
         :guilabel:`Create`. If this is your first database deployment,
         click :guilabel:`Build a Database`, then click 
         :guilabel:`Advanced Configuration Options`.

   .. step:: Select cluster options

      a. Click :guilabel:`Shared`.
      #. Select a cloud provider and region. To learn more, see
         :atlas:`Cloud Providers and Regions 
         </cloud-providers-regions>`.
      #. Expand the :guilabel:`Cluster Details` section and specify a
         name for the cluster in the :guilabel:`Cluster Name` field.
   
   .. step:: Click Create Cluster

      {+atlas+} deploys a free, three-node replica set with the 
      cluster name you specified.

Deploy a Replica Set in the Terminal
------------------------------------

This tutorial describes how to create a three-member 
:term:`replica set` from three existing :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances
running with :ref:`access control <authorization>` disabled.

To deploy a replica set with enabled :ref:`access control <authorization>`, see
:ref:`deploy-repl-set-with-auth`. If you wish to deploy a
replica set from a single MongoDB instance, see
:ref:`server-replica-set-deploy-convert`. For more
information on replica set deployments, see the :ref:`replication` and
:ref:`replica-set-architecture` documentation.
