==================
MongoDB Versioning
==================


.. important:: 

   Always upgrade to the latest stable revision of your release series.

MongoDB versioning has the form ``X.Y.Z`` where ``X.Y``
refers to either a release series or development series and ``Z``
refers to the revision/patch number.

- If ``Y`` is even, ``X.Y`` refers to a release series; for example,
  ``3.6`` release series and ``4.0`` release series. Release series are
  **stable** and suitable for production.

- If ``Y`` is odd, ``X.Y`` refers to a development series; for example,
  ``4.1`` development series and ``4.3`` development series.
  Development series are **for testing only and not for production**.

For example, in MongoDB version ``3.6.14``, ``3.6`` refers to the
release series and ``.14`` refers to the revision.

New Releases
------------

Changes in the release series (e.g. ``3.4`` to ``3.6``) generally mark
the introduction of new features that may break backwards compatibility.

Patch Releases
--------------

Changes to the revision number (e.g. ``3.6.13`` to ``3.6.14``)
generally mark the release of bug fixes and backwards-compatible
changes.

Driver Versions
---------------

The version numbering system for MongoDB differs from the system
used for the MongoDB drivers.
