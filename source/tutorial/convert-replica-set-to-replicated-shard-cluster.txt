Overview
--------

This tutorial converts a single three-member replica set to a sharded
cluster with two shards. Each shard is an independent three-member
replica set. The procedure is as follows:

#. Create the initial three-member replica set and insert data into a
   collection. See :ref:`convert-setup-initial-set`.

#. Start the config databases and a :binary:`~bin.mongos`. See
   :ref:`convert-deploy-sharding-infrastructure`.

#. Add the initial replica set as a shard. See
   :ref:`convert-add-initial-shard`.

#. Create a second shard and add to the cluster. See
   :ref:`convert-add-second-shard`.

#. Shard the desired collection. See :ref:`convert-shard-collection`.

Prerequisites
-------------

This tutorial uses a total of ten servers: one server for the
:binary:`~bin.mongos` and three servers each for the first :term:`replica
set`, the second replica set, and the :doc:`config servers
</core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>`. 

Each server must have a resolvable domain, hostname, or IP address
within your system.

The tutorial uses the default data directories (e.g. ``/data/db`` and
``/data/configdb``). Create the appropriate directories with
appropriate permissions. To use different paths, see
:doc:`/reference/configuration-options` .

The tutorial uses the :doc:`default ports
</reference/default-mongodb-port>` (e.g. ``27017`` and ``27019``). To
use different ports, see :doc:`/reference/configuration-options`.

Considerations
--------------

In production deployments, use exactly **three** config servers. Each
config server must be on a separate machine.

In development and testing environments, you can deploy a cluster with
a single config server.

Procedures
----------

.. _convert-setup-initial-set:

Set Up Initial Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure creates the initial three-member replica set ``rs0``.
The replica set members are on the following hosts:
``mongodb0.example.net``, ``mongodb1.example.net``, and
``mongodb2.example.net``.

.. include:: /includes/steps/convert-replica-set-shard-deploy-test-data.rst

For more information on deploying a replica set, see
:doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set`.

.. _convert-deploy-sharding-infrastructure:

Deploy Config Databases and ``mongos``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure deploys the three config servers and the
:binary:`~bin.mongos`. The config servers use the following hosts:
``mongodb7.example.net``, ``mongodb8.example.net``, and
``mongodb9.example.net``; the :binary:`~bin.mongos` uses
``mongodb6.example.net``.

.. include:: /includes/steps/convert-replica-set-shard-deploy-infrastructure.rst

.. _convert-add-initial-shard:

Add Initial Replica Set as a Shard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following procedure adds the initial replica set ``rs0`` as a shard.

.. include:: /includes/steps/convert-replica-set-add-shards.rst

.. _convert-add-second-shard:

Add Second Shard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following procedure deploys a new replica set ``rs1`` for the
second shard and adds it to the cluster. The replica set members are on
the following hosts: ``mongodb3.example.net``,
``mongodb4.example.net``, and ``mongodb5.example.net``.

.. include:: /includes/steps/convert-replica-set-add-new-shard.rst

.. _convert-shard-collection:

Shard a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/convert-replica-set-enable-sharding.rst
