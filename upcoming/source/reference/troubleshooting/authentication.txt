Two-Factor Authentication
-------------------------

Missed |sms| Authentication Tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: Use Authenticator Apps When Possible

   Authenticator applications are the preferred method to |sms| for
   two-factor authentication. |sms| is an older protocol with many
   known security vulnerabilities. The U.S.
   :abbr:`NIST (National Institute for Standards and Technology)`
   advised abandoning |sms| for |2fa| in section `5.1.3.2`_ of its
   `Digital Identity Guidelines`_.

If are using |sms|, but do not receive the authentication tokens via
|sms|:

1. Refer to the :doc:`/core/two-factor-authentication`
   page for more details about using two-factor authentication. This
   page includes any limitations which may affect |sms| delivery times.

2. Enter the |sms| phone number with country code first followed by the
   area code and the phone number.

   If you are outside of the United States or Canada, include ``011``
   and the `country code <https://countrycode.org/>`__  because |mms|
   uses the U.S.-based `Twilio <https://www.twilio.com>`_ to send text
   messages. As an alternative to your non-U.S. telephone number, use
   a `Google Voice <https://voice.google.com>`__ telephone number.

   .. example::

      For New Zealand enter ``01164`` before the phone number. 

   If you do not receive the authentication token in a reasonable
   amount of time, contact your |mms| system administrator.

   .. seealso::

      To learn more about limits of |sms| for |2fa|, see 
      :ref:`SMS delivery considerations <sms-delivery-considerations>`.

Delete or Reset Two-Factor Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Contact your system administrator to remove or reset two-factor
authentication on your account.

For administrative information on two-factor authentication, see
:doc:`/tutorial/manage-two-factor-authentication`.

LDAP
----

Forgot to Change ``MONGODB-CR`` Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your MongoDB deployment uses LDAP for authentication, and you
find the following error message:

.. warning::

   You forgot to change ``MONGODB-CR`` to ``LDAP (PLAIN)`` since
   they both take username/password.
