Delete operation removes documents from a :term:`collection`. MongoDB
provides the :ref:`remove() <remove>` method to perform delete operations.

Remove()
--------

The :method:`remove() <db.collection.remove()>` method is the method to
delete documents from a collection. By default, the :method:`remove()
<db.collection.remove()>` deletes all documents that meet the delete
selection criteria. However, using the ``justOne`` option limits the
deletion to just one document.

Note that calling :method:`remove() <db.collection.remove()>` without
specifying the delete selection criteria removes all documents in the
collection.
