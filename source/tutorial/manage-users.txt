Overview
--------

To access |a-mms| organization or the project within that organization,
|a-mms| user must be a member of that organization. Depending on the
user's :ref:`role in the organization <organization-roles>`, the |mms|
user may be required to be a member of the project as well to access a
project.

|a-mms| user can be a member of multiple projects and multiple
organizations. If |a-mms| user is a member of a project, the user's
access to the project is determined by the user's :ref:`project role
<project-roles>`.

Within an organization, you can group users into teams. Users can
belong to multiple teams. Teams can be assigned to multiple projects, and
team members' access to  the project is determined by the team's
:ref:`project role <project-roles>`.

.. note::

   |mms| users are separate from :doc:`MongoDB users
   </tutorial/manage-mongodb-users>`.

Manage Organization Users
-------------------------

.. _add-users:

   If the console finds a connected Jira account, |mms| will automatically
   add the user to your Jira group and the |mms| console.

   Users can also create accounts using the `account registration page
   <https://cloud.mongodb.com/user/register/user>`_, or through Jira at
   `jira.mongodb.org <http://jira.mongodb.org/>`_.

   .. index:: users; propagation

   .. note::

      If you create an account in Jira or make any changes to that
      account from *within* Jira, it can take up to 30 minutes for that
      change to propagate to |mms|. During this window you cannot add a
      user to a project in |mms|. Also, passwords changed in Jira are subject
      to the same propagation delay for |mms| accounts.

.. only:: onprem

   Users can create accounts using the account registration page of
   your |mms| installation if |mms| configuration is not

   by invitation. The invitation provides a URL that displays the
   registration link.
