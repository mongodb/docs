A *priority 0* member is a secondary that **cannot** become
:term:`primary`. *Priority 0* members cannot *trigger*
:term:`elections <election>`.  Otherwise these members function as
normal secondaries. A *priority 0* member maintains a copy of the data
set, accepts read operations, and votes in elections. Configure a
*priority 0* member to prevent :term:`secondaries <secondary>` from
becoming primary, which is particularly useful in multi-data center
deployments.

For example, in the following diagram, one data center hosts the
primary and a secondary. A second data center hosts one *priority 0*
member that cannot become primary.

Priority 0 Members as Standbys
------------------------------

A *priority 0* member can function as a standby. In some replica sets,
it might not be possible to add a new member in a reasonable amount of
time. A standby member keeps a current copy of the data to be able to
replace an unavailable member.

In many cases, you need not set standby to *priority 0*. However, in
sets with varied hardware or :ref:`geographic distribution
<replica-set-geographical-distribution>`, a *priority 0* standby
ensures that only qualified members become primary.

A *priority 0* standby may also be valuable for some members of a set
with different hardware or workload profiles. In these cases, deploy a
member with *priority 0* so it can't become primary. Also consider
using an :ref:`hidden member <replica-set-hidden-members>` for this
purpose.

If your set already has seven voting members, also configure the
member as :ref:`non-voting <replica-set-non-voting-members>`.

Priority 0 Members and Failover
-------------------------------

When configuring a *priority 0* member, consider potential failover
patterns, including all possible network partitions. Always ensure
that your main data center contains both a quorum of voting members
and contains members that are eligible to be primary.

Configuration
-------------

To configure a *priority 0* member, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-secondary-only-replica-set-member`.
