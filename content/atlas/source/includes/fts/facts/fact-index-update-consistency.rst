.. note::

   While your updated index is building, different nodes might update at
   varying speeds. During this period, you might experience mixed query
   results, reflecting both the new index definition and the previous
   index definition. You can view the index that is serving queries in
   the :ref:`index status details <queryable-index>` page in the
   {+atlas-ui+}.
