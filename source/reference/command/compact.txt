Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: compact

   Rewrites and defragments all data and indexes in a collection. On
   :ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>` databases, this command will release
   unneeded disk space to the operating system.

   :dbcommand:`compact` has the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { compact: <collection name> }

   :dbcommand:`compact` takes the following fields:

   .. admonition:: Starting in MongoDB 4.2
      :class: note

      MongoDB removes the MMAPv1 storage engine and the MMAPv1 specific
      options ``paddingFactor``, ``paddingBytes``, ``preservePadding``
      for :dbcommand:`compact`.

.. warning:: Always have an up-to-date backup before performing server
   maintenance such as the :dbcommand:`compact` operation.


Behavior
--------

Blocking
~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`compact` only blocks operations for the database it is currently
operating on. Only use :dbcommand:`compact` during scheduled maintenance
periods.

You may view the intermediate progress either by viewing the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` log file or by running the :method:`db.currentOp()`
in another shell instance.

Operation Termination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you terminate the operation with the :method:`db.killOp()
<db.killOp()>` method or restart the server before the
:dbcommand:`compact` operation has finished, be aware of the following:

- If you have journaling enabled, the data remains valid and
  usable, regardless of the state of the :dbcommand:`compact` operation.
  You may have to manually rebuild the indexes.

- If you do not have journaling enabled and the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
  :dbcommand:`compact` terminates during the operation, it is impossible
  to guarantee that the data is in a valid state.

- In either case, much of the existing free space in the collection may
  become un-reusable. In this scenario, you should rerun the compaction
  to completion to restore the use of this free space.

Disk Space
~~~~~~~~~~

To see how the storage space changes for the collection, run the
:dbcommand:`collStats` command before and after compaction.

On :ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>`, :dbcommand:`compact` attempts to
reduce the required storage space for data and indexes in a collection, releasing
unneeded disk space to the operating system. The effectiveness of this operation
is workload dependent and no disk space may be recovered. This command is useful
if you have removed a large amount of data from the collection, and do not plan
to replace it.

:dbcommand:`compact` may require additional disk space to run on WiredTiger databases.

Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`compact` commands do not replicate to secondaries in a
:term:`replica set`.

- Compact each member separately.

- Ideally run :dbcommand:`compact` on a secondary. See option
  ``force:true`` above for information regarding compacting the primary.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-command-puts-secondary-into-recovering-compact.rst

Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`compact` only applies to :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances. In a
sharded environment, run :dbcommand:`compact` on each shard separately
as a maintenance operation.

You cannot issue :dbcommand:`compact` against a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

Capped Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On :ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>`, the :dbcommand:`compact`
command will attempt to compact the collection.

Index Building
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.6

:binary:`~bin.mongod` rebuilds all indexes in parallel following the
:dbcommand:`compact` operation.
