      * - Field

        - Contents

      * - :guilabel:`File System Store Name`

        - A name for the file system store.

      * - :guilabel:`Path`

        - The file system path in which the snapshot will be stored.

      * - :guilabel:`MMapV1 Compression Setting`

        - Select whether or not MMapV1 storage engine snapshots are
          compressed. Any backup job using MMapV1 snapshots inherits
          this setting. The default value is ``on``.

          .. note::

             If you plan on using queryable backups, set this value to
             ``off``. Queryable backup cannot query compressed
             snapshots.

      * - :guilabel:`WiredTiger Compression Setting`

        - Select whether or not WiredTiger storage engine snapshots are
          compressed. Any backup job using WiredTiger snapshots
          inherits this setting. The default value is ``off``.

          .. note::

             If you plan on using queryable backups, set this value to
             ``off``. Queryable backup cannot query compressed
             snapshots.

      * - :guilabel:`New Assignment Enabled` checkbox

        - This enables the filestore once it has been created. If you leave
          this unchecked, the filestore is created but no newly started
          backups can be assigned to it.
