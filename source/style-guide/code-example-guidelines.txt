.. note::

   This page provides general guidance for creating code examples in our Docs,
   irrespective of language. Language-specific style guidelines and coding
   standards are in progress.

Code examples demonstrate how to use our products programmatically.
High-quality, well-maintained code improves our docs' usability, builds our
credibility with users, and helps reduce reported issues.

What is a Code Example?
-----------------------

A code example is any size block of code set apart from regular text using a
code-block directive. For details on valid directives, see the
:ref:`code-block-reference` reference.

- Use code-block directives for all code examples. A code block is a visually
  and functionally distinct page element that defines and displays its content
  as code. It is easier to read and better interpreted by robot users (such as
  screen readers, AI models, and crawlers).
- Do not use inline code markup to write code examples. Use
  inline code to format code-related references within text in ``monospace``
  (such as method names).

Types of Code Examples
----------------------

.. note::

   Although "code example" and "snippet" are often used interchangeably, this
   guidance uses "snippet" to mean a context-less block of code.

We categorize code examples into the following types:

- :ref:`Usage Examples <code-category-usage-example>`: Standalone code blocks
  that show how to perform a task, including the relevant setup and context.
- :ref:`Snippets <code-category-snippet>`: Code that illustrates a specific
  concept or detail in the context of a larger example, tutorial, or reference
  page.
- :ref:`Sample Applications <code-category-sample-app>`: Runnable applications
  demonstrating broader use cases.

.. _code-category-usage-example:

Usage Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usage examples are self-contained, actionable code blocks that show how to
accomplish a specific task using MongoDB tools, drivers, or APIs. Usage
examples include enough context to understand, run, and adapt the code
contained in the code block (for example, the code includes any variable
declarations).

.. code-block:: csharp

   using MongoDB.Driver;

   const string connectionUri = "mongodb://<db_username>:<db_password>@<hostname>:<port>/?connectTimeoutMS=10000";

   // Create a new client and connect to the server
   var client = new MongoClient(connectionUri);

.. _code-category-snippet:

Snippets
~~~~~~~~

Snippets are narrowly scoped code blocks that help explain a specific concept
or detail. They are typically used as part of a broader explanation or
tutorial, and are often meaningful only within that context.

Snippets are intended to provide information. They aren't required to be valid
or runnable code. In some cases, a snippets may contain intentionally
incomplete or incorrect code for demonstration purposes (for example, a snippet
showing all possible argument options for a command).

Snippets fall into one of the following subtypes:

- **Non-MongoDB command:**: a command-line (CLI) command for any non-MongoDB
  tooling (e.g. ``mkdir``, ``cd``, or ``npm``), often used in the context of a
  tutorial.

  .. code-block:: shell

    dotnet run MyCompany.RAG.csproj

- **Syntax example**: an example of the syntax or structure for an API method,
  an Atlas CLI command, a ``mongosh`` command, or other MongoDB tooling.

  .. code-block:: text

    mongodb+srv://<db_username>:<db_password>@<clusterName>.<hostname>.mongodb.net

- **Return example**: an example of an object, such as a JSON blob or sample
  document, returned after executing a corresponding piece of code. Commonly
  included as the output of an ``io-code-block``.

  .. code-block:: text

    A timeout occurred after 30000ms selecting a server using ...
    Client view of cluster state is
    {
        ClusterId : "1",
        State : "Disconnected",
        Servers :
        [{
          ServerId: "{ ClusterId : 1, EndPoint : "localhost:27017" }",
          EndPoint: "localhost:27017",
          State: "Disconnected"
        }]

- **Configuration object example**: an example configuration object,
  often represented in YAML or JSON, enumerating parameters and their types.

  .. code-block:: ini

    apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
    kind: AtlasDeployment
    metadata:
    name: my-atlas-cluster
    spec:
    backupRef:
        name: atlas-default-backupschedule
        namespace: mongodb-atlas-system

.. _code-category-sample-app:

Sample Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sample applications are complete, runnable programs that connect multiple
discrete pieces of code. Sample apps may include error handling, framework
integrations, or frontend UI elements.

General Guidelines
------------------

Our code examples should always follow generally accepted coding and security
best practices, and all other applicable guidelines in this Style Guide that
don't conflict with language-specific standards. Remember that users copy and
use these code examples outside of our docs.

Keep the following in mind as you write code examples:

- Treat code like writing: Keep it simple, readable, and relevant to the task.
- Write code that is easy to understand, even if it isn't the most efficient or
  clever.
- Introduce each code block with context, as you would a list or table.
- Include any prerequisites or code dependencies needed for a piece of code.
- Use descriptive names that clearly convey the purpose of the code element
  (e.g. variable, function, class) or placeholder.
- If a code is not intended to be directly used or adapted, such as a return
  object example snippet, make sure the code block is not copyable. To learn
  how to set the copyable option, see :ref:`code-block-reference`.
- Don't write code examples for anti-patterns. If you need to note an
  anti-pattern or a commonly made mistake, use the
  surrounding text, an admonition, or an inline code comment, and ensure that
  it cannot be mistaken for a recommended pattern.
- If a code example is not production worthy in a significant way, communicate
  this to readers through inline code comments *and* in the surrounding text.
- Never use real customer data or hard code secrets in your code. If you're
  unsure how to handle secrets in your code, reach out to the DevDocs team.
- Use inline code comments to explain or call out important details, including:
   - Non-obvious logic or intent. Don't restate the code.
   - Omitted or truncated code.
- Test every code example to ensure it works as intended:
   - When writing or reviewing, run the code as it displays on the page.
   - For tutorials or multi-step examples, begin at the starting point and
     complete all steps exactly, including any prerequisites or setup. Don't
     skip steps or assume they're correct.
   - If you have to make changes or take additional steps to get an example to
     work, make sure those details are reflected in the doc.

.. note::

   For any questions or for help writing or testing code examples, reach
   out to the ``@DevDocs`` team or use the ``#ask-devdocs`` Slack channel.

Considerations for LLMs
-----------------------

Unlike human readers, the robots that consume our docs (such as LLMs and other
AI models) can't infer meaning or intent from context. Robot users struggle
with ambiguity, unclear boundaries, partial or implicit information, and
non-standard patterns.

To ensure that our code examples are robot friendly, keep the following in mind:

- Prefer atomic code examples: code should be as self-contained and self-descriptive as possible so that robot users can understand the code more easily.
- Explain intent, purpose, or expected code behavior through surrounding text
  *and* inline comments.
- Don't interrupt a single code block with text explanations. Keep explanatory
  text before or after the code block, and use inline comments for explanations
  within the code block.
- Prefer conventional file structure, names, and canonical patterns
  (e.g. ``main()``, ``index.js``, ``connect()``). Avoid unnecessary aliasing or
  non-standard structures unless explained clearly.
- Use consistent, descriptive names that indicate purpose. Avoid vague names
  like ``foo``, ``x``, or ``doStuff()``.
- Make sure the correct language is specified for every code block.
- Clearly mark and explain any placeholders, omissions, or truncated code
  through inline comments.
