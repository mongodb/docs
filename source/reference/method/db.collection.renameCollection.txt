db.collection.renameCollection()
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: db.collection.renameCollection()

   :param string target: Specifies the new name of the collection. Enclose the string in quotes.
                       
   :param boolean,optional dropTarget: If ``true``, :program:`mongod` will drop the `target` of :dbcommand:`renameCollection` prior to renaming the collection.

   Call the :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` method on a collection
   object, to rename a collection. Specify the new name of the
   collection as an argument. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.rrecord.renameCollection("record")

   This method renames a collection named ``rrecord`` to
   ``record``. If the target name (i.e. ``record``) is the name of
   an existing collection, then the operation will fail.
   
   The :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` method cannot be 
   used to move a collection across databases.
    
   The :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` method operates 
   within a collection by changing the metadata associated with a 
   given collection. 

   :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` provides a wrapper around the
   :term:`database command` ":dbcommand:`renameCollection`".  Please 
   refer to :dbcommand:`renameCollection` for further warnings and
   messages.
   
   .. warning::
   
      The :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` method and
      :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command will invalidate open 
      cursors which will interrupt queries that are currently returning data.

   .. warning:: 
   
      You cannot use :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` or
      :dbcommand:`renameCollection` with sharded collections.
