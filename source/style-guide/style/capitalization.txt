Be judicious and consistent in your use of capitalization.

Use capitalization for:

- proper names,
- proper adjectives, and
- as style requires.

Don't use capitalization for:

- Common nouns,
- For emphasis,
- To attempt to give a word greater status than other words, or
- At random.

This topic provides general guidelines to help you decide whether a
term should be capitalized. For the correct capitalization of some
common terms, see :ref:`alphabetical-list-of-terms`.

For capitalization guidelines for items other than terms, see the table
at the end of this topic.

Capitalize Proper Nouns and Adjectives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proper nouns and adjectives include the names of people, places,
companies, organizations, products, languages, protocols, and some
technologies, as well as trademarks.

Be aware that some of these names might have nonstandard or no
capitalization. Always follow the capitalization that's used by the
company, shown in a :mw:`dictionary </>`, or accepted as standard in
the industry.

Capitalize Most Abbreviations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most abbreviated forms of terms use all capitals, although exceptions
exist. Also, be aware that the corresponding spelled-out terms of
abbreviations are often not capitalized. When in doubt about the
capitalization of an abbreviation or its spelled-out term, consult a
dictionary, industry style guide, reputable website, or editor.
Following are some examples.

Capitalization in Job Titles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Within MongoDB technical documentation, use the following rules for
capitalization in job titles:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1


   * - Use case
     - Examples

   * - If you’re referring to a job role in general, don’t use initial
       capitals.
     - All support technicians will be allocated an account manager and
       a career coach.

   * - Don’t use initial capitals where the title is being used as a
       description.
     -
       - The chief executive is Jane Brown and the associate director
         is Paul Woods.

       - We have a new information developer.

       - I’ll need to ask our sales director.

       - I work as a software architect.

   * - Use initial capitals where the term is serving as an actual
       title with the name of a person: just as you would on a
       business card or email signature.
     -
       - Chief Executive Jane Brown and Paul Woods, Associate Director,
         were both late.

       - Attendee list:

         - Anna Collins, Editorial Director;
         - Shazeen Iqbal, Chief Financial Officer;
         - Pope Francis

Capitalize UI Labels as shown on the UI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you're documenting part of the interface within a procedure or
other type of article or topic, match the capitalization used on the
interface.

When you use terms from the interface as common nouns, don't capitalize
the terms.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 100
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use

   * - Click the action cog to the left of the check name and select
       **Rename Check**.

   * - From the Cloud Control Panel, you can rename a check.

Capitalize the Names of Product Components as Appropriate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the capitalization of major component names that's established
by Marketing, Legal, and the product teams. However, be wary of
overcapitalization of product terms. Not every feature or object in a
product is a proper noun. For example, the Cloud Servers service
enables users to create a *server*, not a *Server*. When the user
creates a server, the user specifies an *image*, *flavor*, and
*network*, not an *Image*, *Flavor*, and *Network*. A Performance
server has a *data disk* and a *system disk*, not a *Data disk* and a
*System disk*. A user uses Cloud Load Balancer to create a *load
balancer*, not a *Load Balancer*.

Many terms that might be capitalized on the interface aren't
capitalized when used as common nouns. When in doubt, consult an
existing style sheet, an editor, or the product team (but be aware that
product teams sometimes tend to overcapitalize terms). Following are
some tips to help you determine whether a noun should be capitalized:

-  Generally, if you can have more than one of something, it's a common
   noun and therefore not capitalized.
-  When a common noun follows the name of a product or component,
   generally that noun isn't capitalized.
-  When you refer generally to a component, you can use lowercase (as
   in the utility or the agent).

   * - Cloud Control Panel

   * - Zipit Backup Utility

   * - Rate Limiting component

   * - Identity service

   * - servers

   * - backups

   * - containers

   * - authentication

Don't Capitalize Common Nouns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of the time, we have no trouble determining whether a noun is
proper or common. We have a tendency to capitalize product-specific
terms even when they're really just being used as common nouns. A
common noun denotes a whole class of something (for example, *servers*)
or a random member of a class (for example, *a server*). As a general
rule, if you can have more than one of something, it's a common noun
and therefore not capitalized.

       and Groups.

Don't Use All Capitals for Emphasis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To emphasize a term, show it in italics. To emphasize an important
piece of information, consider setting it apart structurally, perhaps
as a note.
