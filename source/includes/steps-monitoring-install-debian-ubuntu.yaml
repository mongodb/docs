title: Install Python Packages and Extensions
stepnum: 1
ref: monitoring-install-python
action:
  pre: |
    Install ``python-setuptools`` to install any remaining Python dependencies.
    Most operating systems provide packages for ``setuptools``.
  language: sh
  code: |
    sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
---
title: Install Python C Extensions
stepnum: 2
ref: monitoring-install-python-c
action:
  pre: |
    While the C extensions are not required for |monitoring|, they significantly
    improve performance. You must have a C compiler (e.g. ``gcc``) and Python
    header files installed on your system. Type this command to install Python
    headers:
  language: sh
  code: |
    sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev

title: Install and Upgrade PyMongo
stepnum: 3
ref:  monitoring-install-upgrade-pymongo
action:
  pre: |
    If you have not installed ``pymongo``, type this command to install the latest
    version:
  language: sh
  code: |
    sudo easy_install pymongo
  pre: |
    To upgrade to the latest version of the driver, type this command:
  language: sh
  code: |
    sudo easy_install -U pymongo
  post: |
    For more information about PyMongo installation, see the Additional 
    Information section below.
    
    If PyMongo was previously installed without C extensions, 
    :doc:`install PyMongo C extensions </monitoring/tutorial/install-pymongo-c-extensions>`.
    
    If you are installing PyMongo and the Monitoring agent on systems that do 
    not have C compilers, :doc:`build PyMongo packages with PyMongo C 
    extensions </monitoring/tutorial/building-pymongo-packages-with-c>`.

title: Install the MongoDB Monitoring Agent
stepnum: 4
ref: install-monitoring-agent
action:
  pre: |
    Download the latest MMS monitoring agent from the |MMS|, located on the
    :guilabel:`Settings` page and the :guilabel:`Monitoring Agent` tab.
    
    With Python software requirements installed, install the MongoDB monitoring
    agent with these commands:
  language: sh
  code: |
    cd mms-agent
    nohup python agent.py > /LOG_DIRECTORY/agent.log 2>&1 &
  post: |
    Replace ``LOG-DIRECTORY`` with the path to your MongoDB logs.
    
    [Add any common agent install gotchas from support as sentence or paragraph. 
    Or above Procedures as a new Considerations section.]
