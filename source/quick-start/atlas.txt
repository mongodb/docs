{+mcli+} provides a command-line interface for managing your 
|service-fullname| projects and clusters. This tutorial demonstrates 
how to: 

- Create one cluster in your |service| project
- Load :atlas:`sample data </sample-data/available-sample-datasets/>` 
  into your |service| cluster
- Add your IP address to your project's IP access list 
- Create a MongoDB user for your |service| cluster
- Connect to your new cluster using the MongoDB Shell, {+mongosh+}.

The reference pages for the commands mentioned in this tutorial are  
available in the :ref:`{+mcli+} Commands <mongocli>`.

.. _quick-start-atlas-reqs:

Prerequisites 
-------------

Before you begin, complete the following tasks: 

- Ensure that your environment is :ref:`compatible <mcli-compatibility>`
- Create an :atlas:`Atlas </organizations-projects/>` organization
- :ref:`mcli-install` 
- :ref:`mcli-configure`

.. _quick-start-atlas-config-cluster:

Configure an |service| Cluster
------------------------------

Use the :ref:`mongocli-atlas-quickstart` command to create an ``M0`` 
cluster in |service|. ``M0`` clusters have some operational :ref:`limitations <atlas-free-tier>`.

You can run this command in two ways: 
      
- Interactive mode - the command prompts you for the cluster settings 
  and provides default values. 
- Noninteractive mode - you run the command with the options.
      
Click the tab to see the command for your preferred mode. 
  
.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Interactive Mode
      :tabid: interactive

      The command prompts you for the cluster settings and provides 
      default options. Press :kbd:`Enter` when prompted to accept the 
      default settings. 

      .. io-code-block::
         
         .. input::
            :language: sh
            
            mongocli atlas quickstart 

         .. output::
            :language: sh

            You are creating a new Atlas cluster and enabling access to it.

            Press [Enter] to use the default values.
