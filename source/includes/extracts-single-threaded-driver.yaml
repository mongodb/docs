  {{intro}}
  
  MongoDB drivers automatically attempt server selection following
  a cluster election or failover event. By default, the {{language}} 
  driver immediately raises an error if its first attempt to select 
  a server fails. The following configuration settings may improve 
  application connectivity to an |service| cluster at the expense of 
  spending more time in a server selection loop:

  - Set :manual:`serverSelectionTryOnce </reference/connection-string/index.html#urioption.serverSelectionTryOnce>`
    to ``false`` to direct the {{language}} driver to 
    perform server selection up to the time limit defined by 
    ``serverSelectionTimeoutMS``.  

  - Lower the :manual:`serverSelectionTimeoutMS </reference/connection-string/index.html#urioption.serverSelectionTimeoutMS>`
    to ``15000`` from the default of ``30000``. MongoDB elections 
    typically take 10 seconds, but can be as fast as 5 seconds on 
    |service|. Setting this value to 15 seconds 
    (``15000`` milliseconds) covers the upper bound of election plus
    additional time for latency.
