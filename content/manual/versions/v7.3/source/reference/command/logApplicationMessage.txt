Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: logApplicationMessage

   .. include:: /includes/note-audit-in-enterprise-only.rst

   The :dbcommand:`logApplicationMessage` command allows users to post
   a custom message to the :ref:`audit <auditing>` log. If
   running with authorization, users must have :authrole:`clusterAdmin`
   role, or roles that inherit from :authrole:`clusterAdmin`, to run
   the command.

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-all.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst
   
Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   db.runCommand(
      {  
        logApplicationMessage: <string> 
      }
   )

Behavior
--------

MongoDB associates these custom messages with the :ref:`audit
operation <audit-action-details-results>` ``applicationMessage``,
and the messages are subject to any :ref:`filtering <audit-filter>`.
