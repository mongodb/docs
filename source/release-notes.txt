New Features
````````````

- **General Availability - Multi Cluster Sharded Clusters**: Support configuring 
  highly available MongoDB Sharded Clusters across multiple Kubernetes clusters.
  
  - ``MongoDB`` resources of type Sharded Cluster now support both single and 
    multi cluster topologies.
  - The implementation is backwards compatible with single cluster deployments 
    of MongoDB Sharded Clusters, by defaulting ``spec.topology`` to 
    ``SingleCluster``. Existing ``MongoDB`` resources do not need to be modified 
    to upgrade to this version of the |k8s-op-short|.
  - Introduces support for Sharded deployments across multiple |k8s| clusters 
    without requiring a Service Mesh, which you can achieve by enabling all 
    components of such a deployment (including mongos, config servers, and mongod) 
    to be exposed externally to the |k8s| clusters, which enables routing 
    via external interfaces.
  - To learn more, see the `public documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kubernetes-operator/current/reference/k8s-operator-specification/#sharded-cluster-settings>`__.

- **MongoDB**: Adds opt-out to anonymized telemetry for the |k8s-op-short|. The 
  data collected by telementry does not contain any Personally Identifiable 
  Information (PII) or even data that can be tied back to any specific customer 
  or company. See the `public documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kubernetes-operator/current/reference/meko-telemetry>`__ to learn more about:
  
  - What data is included in the telemetry
  - How to disable telemetry
  - What RBACs are added and why they are required

- **MongoDB**: Adds a new validation to Sharded Cluster deployments to ensure 
  the correctness of scaling operations,. This validation restricts scaling 
  different components in two directions simultaneously within a single change 
  to the YAML file. For example, it is not allowed to add more nodes (scaling up) 
  to shards while simultaneously removing (scaling down) config servers or mongos. 
  This restriction also applies to multi-cluster deployments. A simple change 
  that involves "moving" one node from one cluster to another—without altering 
  the total number of members—will now be blocked. It is necessary to perform 
  a scale-up operation first and then execute a separate change for scaling down.

Bug Fixes
`````````

- Fixes the bug when status of ``MongoDBUser`` was being set to ``Updated`` 
  prematurely. For example, new users were not immediately usable following 
  ``MongoDBUser`` creation despite the operator reporting ``Updated`` state.
- Fixed a bug causing cluster health check issues when ordering of users and 
  tokens differed in Kubeconfig.
- Fixed a bug when deploying a Multi-Cluster sharded resource with an external 
  access configuration could result in pods not being able to reach each others.
- Fixed a bug when setting ``spec.fcv = AlwaysMatchVersion`` and ``agentAuth`` 
  to be ``SCRAM`` causes the operator to set the auth value to be ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` 
  instead of ``SCRAM-SHA-256``.
