.. _1.19.0-c2c-release-notes:

1.19.0 Release
--------------

**January 27, 2026**

Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Starting in 1.19, ``mongosync`` no longer supports migrating from source clusters 
  that run MongoDB 4.4. Additionally, ``mongosync`` does not support migrating
  to destination clusters that run MongoDB 6.0. For updated version compatibility, 
  see :ref:`c2c-server-version-compatibility`.

- Drops support for Ubuntu 18.04. Adds support for Amazon Linux 2023 ARM64.
  See :ref:`c2c-install-linux` for updated Linux compatibility.

New Features 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adds ``indexBuilding`` object to the ``/progress`` API response and logs
  to report progress on index builds. See :ref:`c2c-api-progress` for more details.

- Adds a feature that automatically reduces the degree of parallelism of 
  collection copy phase writes for small migrations to small destination 
  clusters. For more details, see :ref:`c2c-collection-copy`.

- ``mongosync`` automatically optimizes index builds on destination clusters by
  batching and parallelizing :dbcommand:`createIndexes` commands.
  For more information and to explicitly configure batching and parallelism, see 
  :ref:`mongosync-index-build-optimizations`.

- Adds the ``estimatedOplogTimeRemaining`` field to the :ref:`/progress <c2c-api-progress>`
  API response and logs. This field estimates the oplog time available on the source cluster
  and helps you determine whether the source oplog is large enough for
  ``mongosync`` to complete the migration.

- Adds the ``warnings`` field to the :ref:`/progress <c2c-api-progress>`
  API response and logs. ``mongosync`` includes this field when the estimated 
  oplog time remaining on the source cluster is too low for a successful migration. 

Fixed Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixes a bug where the embedded verifier reported a mismatch if a source
  collection had the ``autoIndexId`` collection option, which was deprecated in
  MongoDB 3.2 and removed in MongoDB 3.4.

- Fixes a bug where the embedded verifier overestimated the amount of memory 
  needed for verification in sharded clusters.

Other Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``mongosync`` logs now include a ``pid`` field that indicates the process ID 
  (PID) of the current ``mongosync`` process. This helps when a single log file
  contains logs from multiple ``mongosync`` runs.

Live Upgrades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Live upgrades to ``mongosync`` 1.19 are not supported.
