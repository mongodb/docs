.. group:: $stdDevSamp

   .. versionadded:: 3.2

   Calculates the sample standard deviation of the input values. Use if
   the values encompass a sample of a population of data from which
   to generalize about the population. :group:`$stdDevSamp` ignores
   non-numeric values. 

   If the values represent the entire population of data or you do not
   wish to generalize about a larger population, use
   :group:`$stdDevPop` instead.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-aggregation-accumulator-stdDevSamp.rst

   When used in the :pipeline:`$group` stage, :group:`$stdDevSamp` has the
   following syntax and returns the sample standard deviation of the
   specified expression for a group of documents that share the same
   group by key:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $stdDevSamp: <expression> }

   When used in the other supported stages,
   :group:`$stdDevSamp` returns the sample standard deviation of
   the specified expression or list of expressions for each document
   and has one of two syntaxes:

   - :group:`$stdDevSamp` has one specified expression as its operand:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { $stdDevSamp: <expression> }

   - :group:`$stdDevSamp` has a list of specified expressions as its
     operand:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { $stdDevSamp: [ <expression1>, <expression2> ... ]  }

   The argument for :group:`$stdDevSamp` can be any
   :ref:`expression <aggregation-expressions>` as long as it resolves
   to an array. For more information on expressions, see
   :ref:`aggregation-expressions`.

Behavior
--------

Non-numeric Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:group:`$stdDevSamp` ignores non-numeric values. If all operands for a
sum are non-numeric, :group:`$stdDevSamp` returns ``null``.

Single Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the sample consists of a single numeric value, :group:`$stdDevSamp`
returns ``null``.

Array Operand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the :pipeline:`$group` stage, if the expression resolves to an
array, :group:`$stdDevSamp` treats the operand as a non-numerical value.

Example
-------

A collection ``users`` contains documents with the following fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {_id: 0, username: "user0", age: 20}
   {_id: 1, username: "user1", age: 42}
   {_id: 2, username: "user2", age: 28}
   ...

To calculate the standard deviation of a sample of users, following
aggregation operation first uses the :pipeline:`$sample` pipeline to
sample 100 users, and then uses :group:`$stdDevSamp` calculates the
standard deviation for the sampled users.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.aggregate(
      [
         { $sample: { size: 100 } },
         { $group: { _id: null, ageStdDev: { $stdDevSamp: "$age" } } }
      ]
   )

The operation returns a result like the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : null, "ageStdDev" : 7.811258386185771 }
