===========================
Delete |monitoring| Agents
===========================

.. start-content

The |mms| adds a monitoring agent when the agent reports to the service upon
startup. MMS does not send commands to a monitoring agent. Nor can the MMS stop
a monitoring agent from reporting data.

The |mms| removes an agent when the agent does not report to the service for
more than 24 hours. A stopped or inactive monitoring agent will not appear in
the list of agents on the :guilabel:`Monitoring Agents` tab on the
:guilabel:`Hosts` page.

There is no way to delete a monitoring agent from MMS except to remove a
monitoring agent on your server then wait 24 hours.

If you delete a monitoring agent by removing it from your environment, thus
removing it from MMS, also delete any alerts for the monitoring agent. For
example, an **Agent Down** alert may trigger if MMS detects 0 monitoring agents,
you have removed your monitoring agent, and have an active alert to notify you
when a monitoring agent is down.
