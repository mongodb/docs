An |ipaddr| is a unique numeric identifier for a device connecting to a
network. In |service|, you can only connect to a cluster from a trusted
IP address. Within |service|, you can create a list of trusted IP
addresses, referred to as a IP access list, that can be used to connect
to your cluster and access your data.

Required Access
---------------

To add your IP address to an IP access list, you must have 
:authrole:`Project Data Access Read/Write` access or higher to the project.

Procedure
---------

You must add your IP address to the IP access list before you can connect to your cluster. To add your IP address to the IP access list:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli 

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-accessLists-create.rst

      .. note::

         If you run ``atlas setup`` with the default selections, you
         don't need to run ``atlas accessLists create``.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      .. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-access-list.rst

To learn more about IP access lists, see :ref:`access-list`.

Next Steps
----------

Now that you added your connection IP address to the IP access list,
proceed to
:doc:`Create a Database User for Your Cluster </tutorial/create-mongodb-user-for-cluster>`.
