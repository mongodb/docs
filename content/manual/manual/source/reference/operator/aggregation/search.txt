   :description: Perform full-text searches in Atlas collections using the `$search` aggregation pipeline stage with Atlas Search indexes.

.. default-domain:: mongodb

``$search`` aggregation pipeline stage performs a full-text search of 
the field or fields in an Atlas collection. The fields must be covered 
by an :atlas:`Atlas Search 
</reference/atlas-search/index-definitions/>` index.

For example, you can use ``$search`` to perform the following types of
operations:

- Searches to match text fields with various patterns.
- Fuzzy matches to find terms with spelling variations.
- Compound queries to combine multiple search conditions.
- Relevance scoring to rank results.
- Return snippets of matching text.
- Vector searches to find documents using vector similarities.
