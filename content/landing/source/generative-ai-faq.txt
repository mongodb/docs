What GenAI Features Does MongoDB Currently Offer?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB offers various generative AI (GenAI) capabilities in its products
and services, including within Atlas and in its software products.

For example, in MongoDB `Compass <https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/compass-ai-data-usage>`__
and `Charts <https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/charts-ai-data-usage>`__,
Atlas users can leverage natural language to generate queries or visualizations.
With MongoDB `Relational Migrator <https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/migrator-ai-data-usage>`__,
GenAI can be leveraged to convert application code and database objects.
With MongoDB for VS Code, the `MongoDB Extension for Github Copilot <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-vscode/copilot/>`__
participant allows developers to generate MongoDB-related code more efficiently through
Github Copilot Chat.

We also offer a GenAI Chatbot within our `MongoDB Documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/>`__
and across various other MongoDB properties. For more information, refer
to our `MongoDB AI Chatbot <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/ai-chatbot-data-usage/>`__ Documentation.

What Services Do These GenAI Features Rely On?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB's current GenAI features are powered by `Azure OpenAI
<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service>`__,
with the exception of the participant within MongoDB for VS Code, which
is powered by Github Copilot. When you use these features, your data is
processed in Microsoft Azure's OpenAI service or Github Copilot.
**No data processed by these services is used to train those third-party models.**

MongoDB has opted out of asynchronous `Abuse Monitoring
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/abuse-monitoring>`__,
meaning no prompts or responses are stored with Azure OpenAI. For more
details, refer to `Azure OpenAI's data management practices
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy>`__.
For information about how Github Copilot processes data,
please refer to the `Github Trust Center <https://copilot.github.trust.page>`__.

What Data Is Sent To The Model?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each MongoDB tool backed by GenAI sends only the minimal required information
to produce the best possible answer. For more specifics about the data
transferred by each tool, please refer to our Documentation:

- `Compass <https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/compass-ai-data-usage>`__
- `Atlas Charts <https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/charts-ai-data-usage>`__
- `Relational Migrator <https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/migrator-ai-data-usage>`__
- `MongoDB for VSCode <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-vscode/ai-data-usage/>`__

Are My Inputs or Outputs from my Use of MongoDB GenAI Features Used to Train Models?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. The data input and output from MongoDB's GenAI features is not used
to train the third-party models that power those features.

Does MongoDB Store My Inputs or Outputs from My Use of GenAI Features?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB may temporarily store inputs and outputs generated by the GenAI
features for up to one year for troubleshooting, analytics, and feature
improvement. MongoDB will not share those inputs and outputs with any
third-party.

How Can I Disable MongoDB's GenAI Features?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GenAI features within MongoDB's products and services are **optional**.
While they are enabled by default in Atlas for your convenience,
you have the ability to disable them at any time.

Please consult our `Atlas Organization Settings <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/manage-organization-settings/#disable-generative-ai-features>`__
Documentation for information on how Organization Owners can disable
Atlas GenAI features in Atlas at the organization level.

When Atlas GenAI features are enabled at the organization level, individual
Project Owners can still enable or disable individual AI features at the
project level. To learn more about Atlas Project Settings for GenAI features,
please consult the Documentation for each Atlas feature: 

- `Data Explorer <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-ui/>`__
- `Atlas Charts <https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/charts-ai-data-usage>`__

GenAI capabilities offered in our on-premise Relational Migrator and Compass
software can be disabled from within that product: 

- `Relational Migrator <https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/migrator-ai-data-usage>`__
- `MongoDB Compass <https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/compass-ai-data-usage>`__

What Agreements Govern My Use of MongoDB's GenAI Features?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your use of these features is subject to your applicable MongoDB legal 
agreement, our
`Acceptable Use Policy <https://www.mongodb.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy>`_ and 
our `Privacy Policy <https://www.mongodb.com/legal/privacy/privacy-policy>`__.


What About Voyage AI Embedding and Reranking Models?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recently acquired Voyage AI, which offers AI embedding and reranking models.
For more details on how these models work and what data they use, please
refer to the `Voyage AI FAQ <https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/faq>`__
and the `Voyage Terms of Service <https://www.voyageai.com/tos>`__.
