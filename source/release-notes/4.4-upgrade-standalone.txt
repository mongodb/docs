Prerequisites
-------------

Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |oldversion| instance must have ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set
to |oldfcv|. To check ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

The operation should return a result that includes
``"featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "4.2" }``.

To set or update ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, run the following
command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "4.2" } )

For more information, see :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

Download |newversion| Binaries
------------------------------

Via Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-with-package-mgr.rst

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the `MongoDB Download
Center <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download?tck=docs_server>`_.

See |installationdoc| for more information.
