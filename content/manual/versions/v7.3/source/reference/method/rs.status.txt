.. method:: rs.status()

   Returns the replica set status from the point of view of the member
   where the method is run. 

   .. |dbcommand| replace:: :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` command
   .. include:: /includes/fact-mongosh-shell-method-alt

   This output reflects the current status of the replica set, using
   data derived from the heartbeat packets sent by the other members
   of the replica set.

Output
------

For an example and details on the output, see :ref:`replSetGetStatus
<rs-status-output>`.

If you run the :binary:`~bin.mongosh` helper method :method:`rs.status()` 
(or the :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` command) on a member during its 
:ref:`initial sync <replica-set-initial-sync>` (i.e. :replstate:`STARTUP2` 
state), the command returns :data:`replSetGetStatus.initialSyncStatus`
metrics.
      
Once the member completes its initial sync, the
:data:`replSetGetStatus.initialSyncStatus` metrics becomes unavailable.
