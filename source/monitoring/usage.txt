=====================
Using the MMS Console
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The MMS web console is at the center of the |mms|. 
Through it, you can access all of your monitored objects, set up alerts, 
control users, adjust your settings, and, using |monitoring| dashboards, 
create customized collections of charts for easier data analysis.

The best way to learn about |monitoring|'s capabilities is to browse 
the interface with live data. If you haven't done so already,
please :doc:`install the Monitoring agent </management/install>` 
before proceeding.

For an in-depth description 
of the top-level pages that form the MMS web console, 
consider the following documents:

.. include:: /includes/dfn-list-spec-monitoring-usage-landing.rst

.. include:: /includes/toc-monitoring-usage-landing.rst

Clicking on any host name in the hosts table of the "Hosts" tab 
will give you access to detailed statistics about that host. 
For detailed instructions on interacting with this data, please see
the :doc:`Host Statistics </monitoring/statistics>` documentation.
