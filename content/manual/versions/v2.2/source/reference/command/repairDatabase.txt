   The :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` command checks and repairs errors and
   inconsistencies with the data storage. The command is analogous to
   a ``fsck`` command for file systems.

   If your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance is not running with journaling
   the system experiences an unexpected system restart or crash, and
   you have *no* other intact replica set members with this data, you
   should run the :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` command to ensure that
   there are no errors in the data storage.

   As a side effect, the :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` command will
   compact the database, as the :dbcommand:`compact` command, and also
   reduces the total size of the data files on disk. The
   :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` command will also recreate all indexes
   in the database.

   Use the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        { repairDatabase: 1 }

   Be aware that this command can take a long time to run if your
   database is large. In addition, it requires a quantity of free disk
   space equal to the size of your database. If you lack sufficient
   free space on the same volume, you can mount a separate volume and
   use that for the repair. In this case, you must run the command
   line and use the :option:`--repairpath <mongod --repairpath>`
   switch to specify the folder in which to store the temporary repair
   files.

   This command is accessible via a number of different avenues. You
   may:

   - Use the shell to run the above command, as above.

   - Use the :method:`db.repairDatabase()` in the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
     shell.

   - Run :binary:`~bin.mongod` directly from your system's shell. Make sure
     that :binary:`~bin.mongod` isn't already running, and that you issue
     this command as a user that has access to MongoDB's data
     files. Run as: ::

           $ mongod --repair

     To add a repair path: ::

           $ mongod --repair --repairpath /opt/vol2/data

     .. note::

        This command will fail if your database is not a master or
        primary. In most cases, you should recover a corrupt secondary
        using the data from an existing intact node. If you must
        repair a secondary or slave node, first restart the node as a
        standalone mongod by omitting the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`
        or :option:`--slave <mongod --slave>` options, as necessary.
