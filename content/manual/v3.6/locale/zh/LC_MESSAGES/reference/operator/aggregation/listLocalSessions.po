"When a user creates a session on a :binary:`~bin.mongod` or "
":binary:`~bin.mongos` instance, the record of the session initially "
"exists only in-memory on the instance; i.e. the record is local to the "
"instance. Periodically, the instance will sync its cached sessions to the"
" :data:`system.sessions <config.system.sessions>` collection in the "
"``config`` database, at which time, they are visible to "
":pipeline:`$listSessions` and all members of the deployment. Until the "
"session record exists in the ``system.sessions`` collection, you can only"
" list the session via the :pipeline:`$listLocalSessions` operation."
