MongoDB only supports single-version downgrades. You cannot downgrade to
a release that is multiple versions behind your current release. You may
downgrade a |newseries| to a |oldseries| deployment, however, further
downgrading that |oldseries| deployment to a |olderseries| deployment is
not supported.
