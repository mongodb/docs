  :guilabel:`Choose Connection Type` from the set of available buttons.

  .. note:: Options Display if Feature Enabled
  
     |service| displays the connection type options after you enable
     :doc:`Private IP for Peering </security-vpc-peering>`,
     :ref:`Private Endpoint <atlas-configure-private-endpoint>`, or
     both. If you haven't enabled either feature, no buttons display
     and **Connection Type** defaults to **Standard**.

  .. tabs::

     .. tab:: Standard Connection
        :tabid: standard

        Use this connection type for allowed public IP addresses.

     .. tab:: Private IP for Peering
        :tabid: peering

        Use this connection type if you enabled peering:

        - For |gcp| or |azure| and are connecting with {{connChoice}}
          from a peered network, or
        - For |aws| and are connecting with {{connChoice}} from a
          peered network which uses a custom |dns| service.

        If neither of these apply, add your IP address to your IP
        access list and use the Standard Connection string. If you are
        connecting directly to |service| from an office or home
        network, this might be the preferred option.

        .. note::

           You can't select this option unless one of your peers
           is marked as ``AVAILABLE``. Navigate to :guilabel:`Network
           Access` to :doc:`check the status of your peers </security-vpc-peering>`.

     .. tab:: Private Endpoint Connection
        :tabid: private

        Use the connection string for the appropriate interface
        endpoint if you are connecting with {{connChoice}} over a
        Private Endpoint connection either because {{connChoice}}:

        - Runs inside your cloud provider network, or
        - Has transitive network access to your cloud provider network.

        If neither of these apply, add your IP address to your IP
        access list and use the Standard Connection string. If you are
        connecting directly to |service| from an office or home
        network, this might be the preferred option.

        .. note::

           You can't select this option unless your configured
           PrivateLink connection is ready to use. Navigate to
           :guilabel:`Network Access` to :ref:`check the status of your
           {+aws-pl+} <atlas-troubleshoot-private-endpoint>`.

           Skip this step if |service| indicates in the
           :guilabel:`Setup connection security` step that you have
           already configured an IP access list entry in your cluster.
           To manage the IP access list, see
           :ref:`Add Entries to the Access List <access-list>`.

        |service| allows standard client connections to the cluster
        from entries in the :ref:`project's IP access list
        <access-list>`. The project IP access list differs from the
        :ref:`API access list <enable-api-access-list>`, which
        restricts *API* access to specific IP or |cidr| addresses.

        If the IP access list is empty, |service| prompts you to add an
        IP address to the project's IP access list. You can either:

        - Click :guilabel:`Add Your Current IP Address` to allow
          access from your current IP address.

        - Click :guilabel:`Add an IP Address` to add a single IP
          address or a |cidr|\-notated range of addresses.

        Provide an optional description for the newly added IP address
        or |cidr| range. Click :guilabel:`Add IP Address` to add the
        address to the IP access list.

        If the IP access list is empty, |service| prompts you to add an
        IP address to the project's IP access list. Click
        :guilabel:`Add a Different IP Address` to add a single IP
        address or a |cidr|\-notated range of addresses.

        Provide an optional description for the newly added IP address
        or |cidr| range. Click :guilabel:`Add IP Address` to add the

  .. important::

     **Skip this step** if |service| indicates in the
     :guilabel:`Setup connection security` step that you have at least
     one database user configured in your project. To manage existing
     database users, see :ref:`mongodb-users`.

  To access the cluster, you need a MongoDB user with access to the
  desired database or databases on the cluster in your project. If your
  project has no MongoDB users, |service| prompts you to create a new
  user with the :ref:`Atlas Admin <atlas-user-privileges>` role.

  a. Enter the new user's :guilabel:`Username`
  b. Enter a :guilabel:`Password` for this new user or click
     :guilabel:`Autogenerate Secure Password`.
  c. Click :guilabel:`Create Database User` to save the user.

  Use this user to connect to your cluster in the following step.

  Once you have added an IP address to your IP access list and added a
  database user, click :guilabel:`Choose Your Connection Method`.

        string.

     #. Fill in the :guilabel:`Password` field with the password

        To connect with a different database user, update the
        :guilabel:`Username` and :guilabel:`Password` fields with
        the username and password of a different database  user.

     #. (*Optional*) To save this connection for future use, fill in the
