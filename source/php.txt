Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official MongoDB PHP driver.
You can add the driver to your application to work with MongoDB in PHP.
The MongoDB PHP Driver consists of the two following components:

- The `extension <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver>`_, which
  provides a low-level API and mainly serves to integrate
  `libmongoc and libbson <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/c/>`_ with
  PHP.

- The `library <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/php-library/current>`_, which
  provides a high-level API for working with MongoDB
  databases consistent with other MongoDB language drivers.

While it is possible to use the extension alone, MongoDB recommends
using both the extension and the library together. Download the
components you need or set up a runnable project by following our
tutorials.

Installation
------------

First, make sure you have a recent version of PHP installed on your
system. See the
`official PHP manual <https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php>`_
for download and installation instructions.

Install the PHP MongoDB Extension before installing the PHP Library for
MongoDB. You can install the extension using
`PECL <https://www.php.net/manual/en/mongodb.installation.pecl.php>`_ on
the command line:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo pecl install mongodb

Finally, add the following line to your ``php.ini`` file:

.. code-block:: text

   extension=mongodb.so

.. note::

   On some systems, there may be multiple INI files for individual SAPIs (e.g.
   CLI, FPM). Make sure to enable the extension in all SAPIs that you need.

The preferred method of installing the PHP library is with
`Composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`_ by running the following from your project root:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ composer require mongodb/mongodb


Additional installation instructions may be found in the
`library documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/php-library/current/tutorial/install-php-library/>`_.

Connect to MongoDB Atlas
------------------------

.. include:: /includes/atlas-connect-blurb.rst

.. code-block:: php

   <?php

   $client = new MongoDB\Client(
       'mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-address>/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority'
   );

   $db = $client->test;

.. include:: /includes/serverless-compatibility.rst

Connect to a MongoDB Server on Your Local Machine
-------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/localhost-connection.rst

To test whether you can connect to your server, replace the connection
string in the :ref:`Connect to MongoDB Atlas <connect-atlas-php-driver>` code
example and run it.

Compatibility
-------------

Due to potential problems representing 64-bit integers on 32-bit platforms,
users are advised to use 64-bit environments. When using a 32-bit platform, be
aware that any 64-bit integer read from the database will be returned as a
`MongoDB\\BSON\\Int64 <https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.mongodb-bson-int64.php>`_
instance instead of a PHP integer type.
