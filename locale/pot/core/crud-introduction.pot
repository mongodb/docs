msgid "MongoDB stores data in the form of *documents*, which are JSON-like field and value pairs. Documents are analogous to structures in programming languages that associate keys with values, where keys may hold other pairs of keys and values (e.g. dictionaries, hashes, maps, and associative arrays). Formally, MongoDB documents are :term:`BSON` documents, which is a binary representation of :term:`JSON` with additional type information. For more information, see :doc:`/core/document`."

msgid "In MongoDB a query targets a specific collection of documents. Queries specify criteria, or conditions, that identify the documents that MongoDB returns to the clients. A query may include a *projection* that specifies the fields from the matching documents to return. You can optionally modify queries to impose limits, skips, and sort orders."

msgid "To enhance the performance of common queries and updates, MongoDB has full support for secondary indexes. These indexes allow applications to store a *view* of a portion of the collection in an efficient data structure. Most indexes store an ordered representation of all values of a field or a group of fields. Indexes may also :ref:`enforce uniqueness <index-type-unique>`, store objects in a :doc:`geospatial representation </applications/geospatial-indexes>`, and facilitate :doc:`text search </core/index-text>`."

For example, MongoDB can return counts of the number of documents that match a query, or return the number of distinct values for a field, or process a collection of documents using a versatile stage-based data processing pipeline or map-reduce operations."
