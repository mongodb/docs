Overview
--------

|mms| Automation lets you deploy, reconfigure and upgrade your MongoDB
databases directly from the |mms| console.

If |mms| is already monitoring your MongoDB processes, you can add them
to Automation.

Automation relies on the {+mdbagent+}, which you install on each
server that hosts a process to be added to automated management. The
{+mdbagent+}s regularly poll |mms| to determine goal configuration
and deploy changes as needed.

Considerations
--------------

Automation doesn't support all MongoDB options, which can result in 
failed import attempts. To learn more, see 
:ref:`om-unsupported-mdb-settings`.

When adding a MongoDB deployment requiring authentication, you have the
option of importing that process's users and roles. During import,
|mms| prompts you to resolve any conflicts that may occur between the
imported users and roles and the managed users and roles.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Ensure that your deployment satisfies the  
  :doc:`deployment requirements </tutorial/provisioning-prep>`.

- |mms| must be currently monitoring the MongoDB processes, and the
  {+mdbagent+} must be running. The processes must appear on the
  |mms| :guilabel:`Deployment` page.

  .. seealso::

     :doc:`/tutorial/add-existing-mongodb-processes` to enable |mms| to
     automate and monitor your MongoDB processes if |mms| does not
     currently do so.
