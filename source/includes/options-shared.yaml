program: _shared
name: help
aliases: -h
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  Returns the options and usage information.
optional: true

program: _shared
name: host
aliases: -h
directive: option
args: <hostname><:port>
description: |
  Specifies a resolvable hostname for the :program:`mongod` to which to
  connect. By default |component| attempts to connect to a MongoDB instance
  running on the localhost on port number ``27017``.

  To connect to a replica set, you can specify the replica set seed name,
  and a seed list of set members, in the following format:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     <replica_set_name>/<hostname1><:port>,<hostname2:<port>,...
optional: false

program: _shared
name: ipv6
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  Enables IPv6 support. Allows |component| to connect to the MongoDB
  instance using an IPv6 network. All MongoDB programs and processes,
  including |component|, disable IPv6 support by default.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: journal
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  Allows |component| operations to use the durability :term:`journal` to
  ensure data files remain valid and recoverable. This option is only
  relevant when specifying the :option:`--dbpath` option.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: password
aliases: -p
directive: option
args: <password>
description: |
  Specifies a password to authenticate to a MongoDB database that requires
  authentication. Use in conjunction with the ``--username`` and
  ``--authenticationDatabase`` options.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: port
directive: option
args: <port>
description: |
  Specifies the port number if the MongoDB instance is not running on the
  standard port (i.e. ``27017``). You may also specify the port number
  using the ``--host`` option.
optional: true

program: _shared
name: ssl
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.5.4

  Enable connection to a :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` that has
  SSL support enabled.

  The `default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
  For more information on MongoDB and SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: sslAllowInvalidCertificates
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.5.4

  Bypasses the validation checks for server certificates and allows
  the use of invalid certificates. When using the
  :setting:`sslAllowInvalidCertificates` setting, MongoDB logs as a
  warning the use of the invalid certificate.

  The `default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
  For more information on MongoDB and SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: sslCAFile
directive: option
args: <filename>
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.5.4

  Specifies the :file:`.pem` file that contains the root certificate chain
  from the Certificate Authority. Specify the file name of the
  :file:`.pem` file using relative or absolute paths.

  The `default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.

  .. versionadded:: 2.5.4

  Specifies the :file:`.pem` file that contains the Certificate Revocation
  List. Specify the file name of the :file:`.pem` file using relative or
  absolute paths.

program: _shared
name: sslFIPSMode
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.5.4

  When specified, |component| will use the FIPS mode of the installed
  OpenSSL library. Your system must have a FIPS compliant OpenSSL library
  to use :option:`--sslFIPSMode`.

  The `default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.

program: _shared
name: sslPEMKeyFile
directive: option
args: <filename>
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.5.4

  Specifies the :file:`.pem` file that contains both the SSL certificate
  and key. Specify the file name of the :file:`.pem` file using relative
  or absolute paths.

  This option is required when using the :option:`--ssl` option to connect
  to a :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` that has
  :setting:`sslCAFile` enabled *without*
  :setting:`sslWeakCertificateValidation`.

  The `default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
  For more information on MongoDB and SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
optional: true

directive: option
args: <value>
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.5.4

  Specifies the password to de-crypt the certificate-key file (i.e.
  :option:`--sslPEMKeyFile`). Only use :option:`--sslPEMKeyPassword` if
  the certificate-key file is encrypted. In all cases, |component| will
  redact the password from all logging and reporting output.

  If the private key in the PEM file is encrypted and you do not specify
  :option:`--sslPEMKeyPassword`, |component| will prompt for a passphrase.
  See :ref:`ssl-certificate-password`.

  The `default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
