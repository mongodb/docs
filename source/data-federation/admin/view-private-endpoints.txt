      To retrieve a single private endpoint through the |api|, send a ``GET`` 
      request to the ``privateNetworkSettings/endpointIds/`` 
      endpoint with the ID of the private endpoint to retrieve. To learn more 
      about the syntax and options, see :oas-atlas-op:`API 
      </returnOneDataFederationPrivateEndpointInOneProject>`.

      To retrieve all the private endpoints using the |api|, send a ``GET`` 
      request to the ``privateNetworkSettings/endpointIds`` endpoint. To 
      learn more about the syntax and options, see :oas-atlas-op:`API 
      </returnAllDataFederationPrivateEndpointsInOneProject>`.
 
   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui
