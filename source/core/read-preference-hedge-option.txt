==================
Hedged Read Option
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can specify the use of :ref:`hedged reads <mongos-hedged-reads>` for 
non-``primary`` :doc:`read preferences </core/read-preference>` on sharded 
clusters.

With hedged reads, the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances can route read
operations to two replica set members per each queried shard and return
results from the first respondent per shard.

.. include:: /includes/list-hedged-reads-operations.rst

To specify hedged read for a read preference, use the hedged read option for 
read preferences.

Enable Hedged Reads
-------------------

To use hedged reads, enable the hedge read option for non-``primary``
read preferences. Read preference :readmode:`nearest` specifies hedged
read by default.

- When using the drivers, refer to the :driver:`drivers' read preference API
  </>`.

- When using :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, you can use the helper
  methods :method:`cursor.readPref()` and :method:`Mongo.setReadPref()`.
