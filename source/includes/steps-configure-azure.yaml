title: Create a new Cloud Service.
stepnum: 2
level: 4
ref: cloud-service
content: |
  A Cloud Service acts as a logical isolation container for your virtual
  machines (typically serving a similar greater purpose). In a single
  Cloud Service alone, all Virtual Machines have unfettered network access
  to each other. Do the following:

  a. In Azure's left-hand workspaces pane, click :guilabel:`Cloud Services`.

  b. Click :guilabel:`New` in the icon drawer at the bottom of the screen.

  c. Select :guilabel:`Compute > Cloud Service > Custom Create`.

  d. Do the following:

     - Enter the URL for the Cloud Service.

     - Choose a **Region**, *not* an Affinity Group.

  e. Create the service.

title: Create a new Virtual Network.
stepnum: 3
level: 4
ref: virtual-network
content: |
  A virtual network defines the network topology within your Cloud
  Service. It causes your Virtual Machines to have a known set of private
  IP addresses and allows for your Cloud Services to connect to other
  Cloud Services in the future. Do the following:

  a. In Azure's left pane, click :guilabel:`Networks`.

  b. Click :guilabel:`New`.

  c. Select :guilabel:`Network Services > Virtual Network > Custom Create`.

  d. Enter a name and make sure the network is in the same region as your Cloud Service. Continue to the next step.

  e. If desired, set up DNS servers or VPN connectivity. These are optional. Continue to the next step.

  f. If desired, add or modify subnets.

  g. Create the network.

title: Create a Deployment in the Cloud Service.
stepnum: 4
level: 4
ref: deployment
content: |
  In order for |mms| to see your Cloud Service as properly configured, a
  Deployment must exist within it. In order to initially create a
  Deployment, you must create any kind of Virtual Machine within the Cloud
  Service and bind it to a Virtual Network. Do the following:

  a. In Azure's left-hand workspaces pane, click :guilabel:`Virtual Machines`.

  b. Click :guilabel:`New` in the icon drawer at the bottom of the screen.

  c. Select :guilabel:`Compute > Virtual Machine > From Gallery`.

  d. Select an Operating System and image. Continue to the next step.

  e. Configure your virtual machine according to your needs. You must supply either a password or SSH Key. Continue to the next step.

  f. Select the virtual network you just created in order to properly configure the Deployment. Continue until the machine is created with default settings.

  g. Once the virtual machine is started, shut down the virtual machine.

     Your Cloud Service is now configured.
