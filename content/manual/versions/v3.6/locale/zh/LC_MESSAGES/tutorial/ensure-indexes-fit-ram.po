"The above example shows an index size of almost 4.3 gigabytes. To ensure "

"available but also must have RAM available for the rest of the "

msgid ""
"Indexes do not have to fit *entirely* into RAM in all cases. If the value"
" of the indexed field increments with every insert, and most queries "
"select recently added documents; then MongoDB only needs to keep the "
"parts of the index that hold the most recent or \"right-most\" values in "
"RAM. This allows for efficient index use for read and write operations "
"and minimize the amount of RAM required to support the index."
