.. dbcommand:: profile

   .. versionchanged:: 5.0

   For a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, the command enables, disables,
   or configures the :ref:`database profiler <database-profiler>`. The
   profiler captures and records data on the performance of write
   operations, cursors, and database commands on a running
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. If the profiler is disabled, the
   command configures how slow operations are logged to the diagnostic
   log.

   On :binary:`~bin.mongod`, if the :ref:`database profiler level
   <set-profiling-level-level>` is ``2``, full logging is enabled on
   the profiler and the :option:`diagnostic log <mongod --logpath>`.

   At :ref:`database profiler level <set-profiling-level-level>` ``1``,
   the following settings modify both the profiler and the
   :option:`diagnostic log <mongod --logpath>`:

   - :ref:`slowms <set-profiling-level-options-slowms>`
   - :ref:`sampleRate <set-profiling-level-options-sampleRate>`
   - :ref:`filter <set-profiling-level-options-filter>`

   If the :ref:`database profiler level <set-profiling-level-level>` is
   ``0``, the :ref:`database profiler <database-profiler>` is disabled.
   At level ``0`` the following settings only modify the diagnostic log:
   
   - :ref:`slowms <set-profiling-level-options-slowms>`
   - :ref:`sampleRate <set-profiling-level-options-sampleRate>`
   - :ref:`filter <set-profiling-level-options-filter>`

   For a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance, the command only configures how 
   operations get written to the diagnostic log. You cannot enable the 
   :ref:`database profiler <database-profiler>` on a :binary:`~bin.mongos` 
   instance because ``mongos`` does not have any collections that the profiler 
   can write to.

   .. include:: /includes/log-changes-to-database-profiler.rst

   On :binary:`~bin.mongos`, you can set ``profile`` level to:

   - ``0`` to set the ``slowms``, ``sampleRate``, and ``filter`` for
     the diagnostic log;

   - ``-1`` to read the current settings.

   The profiler is off by default.

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-all.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
     {
       profile: <level>,
       slowms: <threshold>,
       sampleRate: <rate>,
       filter: <filter expression>
     }
   )

.. _slowms-threshold-option:

Command Fields
--------------

The command takes the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``profile``
     - int
     - Configures the profiler level.
       The following profiler levels are available:
       
       .. include:: /includes/database-profiler-levels.rst
       
       Since profiling is not available on :binary:`~bin.mongos`, the
       :dbcommand:`profile` command cannot be used to set the profiling
       level to a value other than ``0`` on a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

   * - ``slowms``
     - int
     - Optional. Default: 100

       .. include:: /includes/dbcommand-slowms-definition.rst

       This argument affects the same setting as the configuration option
       :setting:`operationProfiling.slowOpThresholdMs`.

   * - ``sampleRate``
     - double
     - Optional. Default: 1.0

       The fraction of *slow* operations that should be profiled or logged.
       ``sampleRate`` accepts values between 0 and 1, inclusive.

       This argument affects the same setting as the configuration option
       :setting:`operationProfiling.slowOpSampleRate` and does not
       affect the slow oplog entry log messages on secondaries.

   * - ``filter``
     - object
     - .. _profile-filter-def:
 
       Optional.
       A query that determines which operations are profiled or
       logged.
 
       The filter query takes the following form:
 
       .. code-block:: javascript
         
          { <field1>: <expression1>, ... }
 
       The query can be any legal :method:`~db.collection.find()`
       operation where the query ``<field>`` matches a field in the
       :ref:`profiler output <profiler>`.

       This argument affects the same setting as the
       configuration option :setting:`operationProfiling.filter`.
       When ``filter`` is set, the ``slowms`` and ``sampleRate``
       options are not used for profiling and slow-query log
       lines.

The :method:`db.getProfilingStatus()` and
:method:`db.setProfilingLevel()` :ref:`shell methods
<js-administrative-methods>` provide wrappers around the
:dbcommand:`profile` command.

.. |binary| replace:: :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`

Behavior
--------

The :dbcommand:`profile` command obtains a write lock on the affected
database while enabling or disabling the profiler. This is typically a
short operation. The lock blocks other operations until the
:dbcommand:`profile` command has completed.

When connected to a sharded cluster through :binary:`~bin.mongos`, you can run 
the :dbcommand:`profile` command against any database.

   :ref:`Database Profiling <database-profiling>`

Example
-------

Enable Filtering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable profiling and filter the logged data:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( 
      {
        profile: 1,
        filter:
           {
              $or:
              [
                 { millis: { $gte: 100 } },
                 { user: "testuser@admin" }
              ]
           }
      }
   )

The :ref:`filter <profile-filter-def>` only selects operations that
are:

- at least ``100`` milliseconds long, or
- submitted by the ``testuser``.

Unset a Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To clear a profile filter, run ``profile`` with the ``filter: "unset"``
option.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      { 
         profile: 1,
         filter: "unset" 
      }
   )

.. include:: /includes/reference/return-set-profile.rst
