|service| provides sample data you can load into your |service|
{+database-deployments+}. You can use this data to quickly get started
experimenting with data in MongoDB and using tools such as the
:ref:`{+atlas-ui+} <atlas-ui>` and :charts:`MongoDB Charts </>`.

For a list of datasets in the sample and a description of each, see
:ref:`available-sample-datasets`. Each dataset page contains
information on the databases, collections, and indexes in the dataset.

Load Sample Data
----------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To utilize the sample data provided by |service|, you must create
an |service| {+database-deployment+} to load data into. To learn more, 
see :ref:`create-new-database-deployment`.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

You can load sample data into your |service| {+database-deployment+} in 
several ways. You can load sample data from the :ref:`{+atlas-ui+} 
<atlas-ui>` :guilabel:`{+Database-Deployments+}` view, or use the 
{+atlas-cli+}.

Select the appropriate tab based on how you would like to load
sample data:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-clusters-loadSampleData.rst

      .. note::

         If you run ``atlas setup`` with the default selections, you
         don't need to run ``atlas loadSampleData``.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui
  
      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: {+Database-Deployment+} View
            :tabid: clusters-view

            To load sample data into your {+database-deployment+} from
            the :guilabel:`{+Database-Deployments+}` view:
         
            .. include:: /includes/steps/load-sample-data-clusters.rst

         .. tab:: Collections View
            :tabid: collections-view

            .. important::
         
               You can load sample data through the
               :guilabel:`Collection View` only if you have 
               :guilabel:`Data Explorer` :ref:`enabled 
               <disable-data-explorer>` and you don't have 
               any data already in your collection.
         
            To load sample data into your {+database-deployment+} from the :guilabel:`Collections View`:
         
            .. include:: /includes/steps/load-sample-data-de.rst

Sample Data Namespaces
----------------------

When you load the sample data, |service| creates the following
namespaces on your {+database-deployment+}:

.. warning::

   If any of these namespaces already exist on your 
   {+database-deployment+} when you attempt to load the sample data, 
   the operation will fail and no sample data will be loaded into your 
   {+database-deployment+}.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
