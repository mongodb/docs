Image Lightboxes
================

Sometimes an image is too large to be legible in the normal page flow.
While it is generally better to redesign the image, you may wish instead
to allow the user to temporarily expand the image to its full size.

This is called a "lightbox", and you may provide the ``lightbox`` option
to the Sphinx `figure <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#figure>`__
directive if the ``mongodb`` extension is activated in your ``conf.py``.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: rst

      .. figure:: /images/compass-array-query-op.png
         :alt: lightbox example
         :figwidth: 200px
         :lightbox:

   .. figure:: /images/compass-array-query-op.png
      :alt: lightbox example
      :figwidth: 200px
      :lightbox:
