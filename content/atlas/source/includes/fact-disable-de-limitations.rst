When :guilabel:`Data Explorer` is disabled, you cannot:

- Terminate slow operations from the
  :ref:`Real-Time Performance Panel <real-time-metrics-status-tab>`.

- Create indexes from the
  :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>`. You
  can still view Performance Advisor recommendations, but you must
  create those indexes from {+mongosh+}.
