You can add Automation to your existing MongoDB deployments by installing
the Automation Agent on each each server that runs MongoDB.

MMS Automation provides an interface for provisioning machines,
configuring MongoDB nodes and clusters, and upgrading your MongoDB
deployment. This tutorial describes configuring |automation| using
systems and infrastructure that you already have configured.

Considerations
--------------

After installation, ensure that the :ref:`directories used by the
Automation Agent <automation-agent-directories>` have appropriate
permissions for the user running the Automation Agent.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before installing the Automation Agent on your existing hardware, review
the :doc:`/core/automation-checklist`.

You may deploy Automation Agents on various Linux operating systems,
including RHEL, CentOS, Amazon Linux, and Ubuntu, and on Mac OSX. MMS
lists the OS version requirements on the :guilabel:`Automation Agent`
install page.

To install the agent using ``rpm`` or ``deb`` packages, you must have root
access.

Procedure
---------

Install the Automation Agent on each each server that is to run
Automation. On each server, perform the following steps:

Next Steps

Once you have successfully deployed automation, see
:doc:`/tutorial/manage-deployments-with-automation` to begin using
Automation to manage MongoDB deployments.
