Users can understand wordy and complex writing. They can wade through
walls of text, but we shouldn't force them to do that. Use the
following guidelines to clarify and condense sentences and paragraphs.

.. _use-consistent-sentence-structure:

Use a Consistent Sentence Structure
-----------------------------------

- As often as possible, use the sentence structure
  *subject*-*verb*-*object*.
- Use simple declarative sentences for descriptions.
- Use simple imperative sentences for instructions.
- Sentences that describe a condition should always begin with the
  conditional clause, so that the user can skip the section if
  the condition does not apply to them.
- Don't make users backtrack to understand a sentence. If they can't
  understand the beginning of the sentence without reading the end,
  rewrite the sentence.

    most adverbs without changing the meaning.

    the meaning. Some features have adjectives in their names. Don't
    remove those.
  - Can you shorten prepositional phrases?
  - Are you using phrases that don't clarify the content?

- Include all necessary words that clarify the meaning of a sentence.

  - Include all necessary articles (*a*, *an*, *the*), prepositions,
    connectors, and other syntactic cues, such as those described in
    :ref:`clarify-gerunds-participles`,
    :ref:`use-that-which-correctly`, and

  between paragraphs.

  embedding the items in a paragraph.
