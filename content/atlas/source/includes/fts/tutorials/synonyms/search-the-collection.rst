Search the Collection 
---------------------

Synonyms can be used only in queries that use the :ref:`text <text-ref>` 
operator. In this section, you connect to your cluster and then
run the sample queries using the ``text`` operator against the ``title``
field in the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection. The sample queries use
words that are configured as synonyms of different mapping types in the
synonyms source collection. The source collection is referenced in the
synonyms mapping that the queries use.
