Domain Migration
================

The App Services base URL is being updated from ``https://realm.mongodb.com/``
to a new URL: ``https://services.cloud.mongodb.com``.

This change applies to the App Services UI, Admin API requests, and Client
API requests through the Atlas Device SDKs.

.. _domain-migration-sdk-versions:

Relevant SDK Versions
---------------------

Starting in the following versions, the SDKs use the new base URL by
default:

- C++ SDK: v1.1.1
- Flutter SDK: v2.1.0
- Java SDK: version TBD
- Kotlin SDK: v1.15.0
- .NET SDK: v12.0.0
- Node.js SDK: v12.7.0
- React Native SDK: v12.7.0
- Swift SDK: v10.49.2
- Web SDK: version TBD

Begin Migration Now
-------------------

The new URL (``https://services.cloud.mongodb.com``) is available now and you
can begin using it by specifying a base URL in your app configuration. You should
also update your domain access lists to allow the new URL.

The old URL (``https://realm.mongodb.com``) will continue to work, but will be
deprecated in the future. We recommend migrating to the new URL as soon as
possible.

Admin API
~~~~~~~~~

To avoid service disruptions, update all Admin API requests to use the new URL
(``https://services.cloud.mongodb.com``). You can do this now.

While the old URL will continue to work for some time, it will eventually be
deprecated.

Client Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Begin using the new URL by specifying it as the base URL in your App 
Configuration. Refer to the SDK docs for details about specifying a base URL:

- :ref:`C++ SDK <cpp-access-the-app-client>`
- :ref:`Flutter SDK <flutter-app-client-configuration>`
- :ref:`Java SDK <java-app-client-configuration>`
- :ref:`Kotlin SDK <kotlin-app-client-configuration>`
- :ref:`.NET SDK <dotnet-app-client-configuration>`
- :ref:`Node.js SDK <node-access-the-app-client>`
- :ref:`React Native SDK <react-native-app-client-configuration>`
- :ref:`Swift SDK <ios-app-client-configuration>`

Domain Access Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use a domain access list, add the new domain to this list to avoid
service disruptions:

.. code-block:: text

   https://services.cloud.mongodb.com
   *.services.cloud.mongodb.com

Regions-Specific Base URLs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your app uses a local region instead of the global endpoint:

.. code-block:: text
  :copyable: false

   https://us-east-1.aws.realm.mongodb.com

Update the local region domain in your App Configuration's base URL to avoid
service disruptions:

.. code-block:: text

   https://us-east-1.aws.services.cloud.mongodb.com
