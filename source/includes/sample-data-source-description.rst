|charts-short| automatically includes the 
:guilabel:`Sample Data: Movies` data source in all |charts-short|
tenants. The :ref:`Sample Dashboard <sample-dashboard>` uses
this data source to show the charts you can create. You can
access the sample data source from all dashboards. 

You can't:
 
- Add, edit, or delete the data in the :guilabel:`Sample Data: Movies`
  data source.
- Remove the sample data source.
- Externally share or :ref:`embed <embedding-charts>` charts
  that use the sample data.
