Solution Overview
-----------------

Retailers must ensure accurate and consistent inventory information
across multiple channels while handling vast amounts of data. However,
traditional methods struggle to keep pace with the demands of today's
dynamic market.

In this scenario, RFID Technology offers a transformative solution. By
automatically tracking tagged items using electromagnetic fields,
retailers gain unprecedented real-time visibility into inventory levels.
This implementation optimize stock management, reduce labor
costs, and elevate customer satisfaction.

Harnessing RFID's potential requires a robust data layer. MongoDB Atlas
provides the solution for capturing, processing, and analyzing these
massive datasets.

RFID Technology Benefits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By integrating RFID Technology with a powerful database solution,
retailers can efficiently address product information management
challenges and unlock key advantages:

- **Inventory accuracy:** Eliminate stock discrepancies and reduce
  out-of-stocks, ensuring products are where customers expect them to be.

- **Operational efficiency:** Streamline processes like receiving,
  picking, and packing, leading to faster turnaround times and cost
  savings.

- **Enhanced customer experience:** Fulfill orders accurately and
  quickly, boosting customer satisfaction and loyalty.

- **Data-driven insights:** Leverage detailed product and sales data to make
  informed business decisions and optimize product assortment.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

Businesses can track items from the manufacturing floor to the end
consumer by attaching RFID tags to products and using a network of
readers. Below, we explain the general architecture of a RFID system
and provide a specific example with Zebra Technologies.

Supply Chain Tracking with RFID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This architecture shows a comprehensive system with RFID Technology to
monitor product movement through the supply chain. MongoDB Atlas serves
as the underlying data layer to manage and analyze RFID data.

Key Components and Functions
````````````````````````````

- **RFID data collection:** Information is captured from RFID tags
  attached to products using RFID readers.

- **Data management:** MongoDB Atlas stores and processes collected RFID
  data.

- **Data analysis:** The system utilizes MongoDB Atlas to extract
  valuable insights from the data through data cleaning, transformation,
  and analysis.

- **Workflow optimization:** The architecture visualizes the data flow
  from initial collection to the generation of actionable insights.

RFID Product Tracking Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using a RFID product tracking architecture, we show an example that
integrates the Zebra Technologies 123RFID app with MongoDB Atlas through
an API gateway.

**Key Components and Functionalities**

- **RFID data capture:** The Zebra Technologies 123RFID app collects product
  information via RFID tags.

- **Data integration:** An API gateway seamlessly transfers RFID data
  from the app to MongoDB Atlas.

- **Data storage and analysis:** MongoDB Atlas serves as the central
  repository for RFID data, enabling comprehensive data analysis.

Building the Solution
---------------------

This guide explains how a retail RFID product tracking application
integrates with MongoDB Atlas and demonstrates how to use it for
efficient inventory checks.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Set up MongoDB Atlas

      **Cluster Setup**
    
      - Select a cloud provider.

      - Choose a region.

      - Configure cluster specifications (e.g., instance size, storage).

      **Network Security**

      - Configure network access.

      - Identify IP access list for edge devices and application
        servers.

      - User authentication.

      - Create a database user with read and write permissions for the
        inventory database.

      **Connection**

      - Obtain connection string from MongoDB Atlas.

      - Use connection string to connect your application to the
        cluster.

   .. step:: Configure your project in Xcode

      **Project Setup**

      - Open the 123RFID (or the name you’ve given it) project in `Xcode
        <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`__.

      - Configure project settings (deployment target).

      - Add necessary frameworks and libraries from Zebra SDK.

      - Configure build settings (library search paths, framework search
        paths).

      **Device Pairing**

      - Enable Bluetooth on iOS device.

      - Pair RFID reader using 123RFID app.
     
      **Running the Application**

      - Connect iOS device to Mac.

      - Select device as target in Xcode.

      - Run the application.

   .. step:: Match inventory tags

      The *getMatchingTagList* method in Objective-C compares RFID tags
      from the current physical inventory with a predefined list of tags
      and updates the user interface accordingly. This procedure works
      as follows:

      - Retrieves current inventory and predefined tag list.

      - Compares inventory tags with the tag list to find matches.

      - Removes matched tags from the missing tags list.

      - Updates UI with counts of unique and total tags.

      - Stops inventory operation and confirms a complete match if all
        tags are accounted.

   .. step:: Send match confirmation

      The *sendUrlRequestToFlag* method sends a POST request to a
      specified URL to indicate the result of the inventory check. This
      process works as follows:

      - Initializes POST request to the target URL.

      - Sets JSON content type header.

      - Prepares JSON payload with inventory check results.

      - Sends POST request and logs the results.

      - Displays a warning message based on the inventory check outcome.

   .. step:: Display your inventory checks in real-time

      We leverage `MongoDB Change Streams
      <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/changeStreams/>`__ for
      instant notifications and visualize the data using `MongoDB Atlas
      Charts
      <https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-charts>`__. The
      code sets up a change stream to monitor new inventory checks in
      the inventoryCheck collection.

      **Endpoint Setup**

      - Use MongoDB Change Streams to monitor changes in the
        inventoryCheck collection.

      .. code-block:: javascript  
         :copyable: true  
  
         const startWatchInventoryCheck = async (dashboard, addAlert, utils) => {      
             console.log("Start watching stream");      
  
             const runs = await getMongoCollection(utils.dbInfo.dbName, "inventoryCheck");      
             const filter = {      
                 filter: {      
                     operationType: "insert"      
                 }      
             };      
  
             const stream = runs.watch(filter);      
  
             const closeStreamInventoryCheck = () => {      
                 console.log("Closing stream");      
                 stream.return();      
             };      
  
             try {      
                 for await (const change of stream) {      
                     console.log(change.fullDocument);      
                     addAlert(change.fullDocument.checkResult);      
                     dashboard.refresh();      
                 }      
             } catch (error) {      
                 console.error("Error watching stream:", error);      
             }      
         };   

      **Embed the dashboard**

      - Use MongoDB Charts embedding SDK to integrate the dashboard into
        your web application.

      - Import the necessary libraries and context.

      - Create an instance of ChartsEmbedSDK with your base URL.
 
      - Define and render the dashboard properties into a designated
        div.
      - Start the change stream and handle real-time updates with
        alerts.

      **Implement Real-time Alerts**

      - Display success or error alerts based on the inventory check
        results using *pushToast*.

      **Ensure Integration**

      - Verify that real-time notifications and dashboard updates work
        seamlessly.

      - Maintain accurate inventory data and respond quickly to
        discrepancies.

Follow this guide to effectively integrate the Zebra 123RFID app with
MongoDB Atlas, enabling real-time inventory management and data
accuracy.
