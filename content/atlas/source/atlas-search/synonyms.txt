The ``synonyms`` option in a |fts| :ref:`index definition
<ref-index-definitions>` specifies synonym mappings that allow you to 
index and search your collection for words that have the same or nearly the same meaning.  
To configure a |fts| :ref:`index <ref-index-definitions>` with synonym mappings, you 
must:

1. Add a collection of synonym documents to your {+cluster+}. Ensure that:  

   - Your collection is in the same database as the index that will 
     reference the collection
   - The documents are :ref:`properly formatted <synonyms-coll-spec>`

#. Reference the synonym source collection in a synonym mapping in 
   the :ref:`index definition <ref-index-definitions>`. 

A synonym mapping configures a |fts| index to support queries that
apply synonyms from a synonym source collection in the same database as
the collection you are indexing. You can use synonyms only in queries
that use the :ref:`text <text-ref>` or :ref:`phrase <phrase-ref>`
operator.

   .. include:: /includes/fts/facts/fact-fts-synonym-mapping-limitation.rst

This page describes the format of the synonyms source collection and 
how to define synonym mappings that reference the synonym source 
collection in your |fts| index. 

.. _synonyms-syntax:

Syntax 
------

``synonyms`` has the following syntax in an index definition: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fts/syntax/fts-index-definition-syntax-synonyms.json 
   :language: json
   :linenos:
   :copyable: true
   :caption: Syntax 
   
.. _synonyms-options:

Options 
-------

``synonyms`` takes the following fields in an index definition:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 15 60 10

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
     - Necessity

   * - ``analyzer``
     - string
     - Name of the :ref:`analyzer <analyzers-ref>` to use with this 
       synonym mapping.
       
       .. include:: /includes/fts/synonyms/fact-field-synonym-analyzer.rst
       
       To use synonyms with stop words, you must either index the 
       field using the :ref:`ref-standard-analyzer` or add the 
       synonym entry without the stop word.

       You can use any |fts| analyzer except the
       following:

       :ref:`Language analyzers <ref-language-analyzers>`:

       - ``lucene.kuromoji`` 
       - ``lucene.cjk``
       
       :ref:`Custom 
       analyzer <custom-analyzers>` tokenizers and token filters: 

       - :ref:`nGram <nGram-tokenizer-ref>` Tokenizer
       - :ref:`edgeGram <edgeGram-tokenizer-ref>` Tokenizer
       - :ref:`daitchMokotoffSoundex <daitchmokotoffsoundex-tf-ref>` 
         Token Filter
       - :ref:`nGram <ngram-tf-ref>` Token Filter 
       - :ref:`edgeGram <edgegram-tf-ref>` Token Filter 
       - :ref:`shingle <shingle-tf-ref>` Token Filter
       - :ref:`wordDelimiterGraph <wordDelimiterGraph-tf-ref>` Token 
         Filter

     - Required

   * - ``name``
     - string 
     - Name of the synonym mapping. Name must be unique in the index 
       definition. Value can't be an empty string. 
     - Required

   * - ``source``
     - document
     - :ref:`Source collection <synonyms-coll-spec>` for synonyms. The 
       ``source`` option takes the ``collection`` field. 
     - Required

   * - ``source.collection``
     - string 
     - Name of the MongoDB collection that is in the same database as 
       the |fts| index. Documents in this collection must be in the 
       format described in the :ref:`synonyms-coll-spec`.
     - Required

.. _synonyms-coll-spec:

Synonyms Source Collection Documents 
------------------------------------

Each document in the collection specified as the source for the 
synonyms describe how one or more words map to one or more synonyms of 
those words. 

.. _synonyms_limits_shared_tier:

.. note:: 

   On free tier clusters, the synonyms collection can't exceed 10,000 documents.

.. _synonyms-coll-format:

Format of Synonyms Source Collection Documents 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must configure each document with the following fields: 

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 10 60 15

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
     - Necessity

   * - ``input``
     - array of strings
     - Required for ``mappingType: explicit`` mappings. 
     
       For ``explicit`` mappings, ``synonyms`` values are synonyms of 
       each ``input`` token. Value can't be an empty or all-whitespace 
       string. You can specify the same ``input`` value in multiple 
       documents.
       
     - Conditional

   * - ``mappingType`` 
     - string
     - Type of mapping. Value can be one of the following: 

       - ``equivalent`` - describes a set of tokens that are equivalent 
         to one another. For an example of this ``mappingType``, see 
         :ref:`Example <synonyms-equivalent-mapping-type-eg>`.

       - ``explicit`` - matches ``input`` tokens and replaces them with 
         all alternative ``synonyms`` tokens. For an example of this 
         ``mappingType``, see :ref:`Example 
         <synonyms-explicit-mapping-type-eg>`.
         
     - Required

   * - ``synonyms``
     - array of strings
     - Words that are synonyms of one another if ``mappingType`` is 
       ``equivalent`` or synonyms of ``input`` tokens if 
       ``mappingType`` is ``explicit``. ``synonyms`` must have at least 
       one value.

       To use synonyms with stop words, you must either add the 
       synonym entry without the stop word or index the field using 
       the :ref:`ref-standard-analyzer`.

       For an example of each ``mappingType`` see 
       :ref:`synonyms-mapping-type-egs`.
       
     - Required

The documents in the collection can contain other fields. The 
documents in the collection are additive, and mappings are 
deduplicated. |fts| synonyms are stored as a separate |service| 
collection, which counts against the same storage quota as any other 
collection in |service|. |fts| might use more compute resources to 
apply synonyms from larger synonyms source collections.

.. warning:: 

   Don't include invalid synonym documents in the synonym source 
   collection. |fts| doesn't create indexes if the indexes use synonym 
   mappings that reference collections with invalid documents. Only 
   include synonym documents that are properly formatted in your 
   synonym source collection.

   MongoDB doesn't recommend adding synonym documents to synonym source 
   collections in a production environment without first validating 
   that they are properly formatted and behave as expected in a test 
   environment.

.. _synonyms-coll-changes:

Changes to Synonyms Source Collection Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you make changes to your synonyms source collection:

- You don't need to reindex because |fts| watches for changes and 
  automatically updates its internal synonym map.
- The time it takes |fts| to update the synonym mappings increases with 
  the synonym source collection size. Note that the changes to synonym 
  documents are reflected in your |fts| query results eventually.

Collection Document Examples 
----------------------------

.. _synonyms-mapping-type-egs:

Source Collection Document Examples 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| provides the documents for the following |fts| mapping type
examples in a collection named ``sample_synonyms``. You can load these
documents on your {+cluster+} in the same database as your collection. To
load these documents on your {+cluster+}, when you
:ref:`create the index <ref-create-index>` for your collection, do the following: 

a. When you select the :guilabel:`Configuration Method`, select the
   :guilabel:`Visual Editor`. 
#. When you :guilabel:`Add synonym mapping` to your index, select
   :guilabel:`Load sample collection` from the :guilabel:`Synonym source
   collection` dropdown. 

.. _synonyms-equivalent-mapping-type-eg:

``equivalent`` ``mappingType``
``````````````````````````````

In the following example source collection document, the ``mappingType`` is set to ``equivalent`` so that the tokens 
``car``, ``vehicle``, and ``automobile`` are configured to be synonyms of one another. 

.. code-block:: json 
   :copyable: false

   {
     "mappingType": "equivalent",
     "synonyms": ["car", "vehicle", "automobile"]
   }

For a :ref:`text <text-ref>` query for ``car``, ``vehicle``, or 
``automobile`` applying a synonym mapping that includes such a 
document, |fts| returns documents that contain the term ``car``, 
``vehicle``, or ``automobile``.

.. _synonyms-explicit-mapping-type-eg:

``explicit`` ``mappingType``
````````````````````````````

In the following example source collection document, ``mappingType`` is set to ``explicit`` 
so that the tokens ``beer``, ``brew``, and ``pint`` are configured to be synonyms of 
the ``input`` token ``beer``. 

.. code-block:: json 
   :copyable: false

   {
     "mappingType": "explicit",
     "input": ["beer"],
     "synonyms": ["beer", "brew", "pint"]
   }

For a :ref:`text <text-ref>` query for ``beer`` applying a synonym mapping 
that includes such a document, |fts| returns documents that contain 
the terms "beer", "brew", or "pint" because the ``input`` token 
``beer`` is explicitly mapped to all these ``synonyms`` tokens. 
However, for a query for ``pint``, |fts| does not find documents 
that contain ``beer`` because ``pint`` is not explicitly mapped to 
``beer``.

.. _sample-synonyms-coll:

Synonym Source Collection Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following collection named ``synonymous_terms`` is an example synonym
source collection that can be used with the ``movies`` collection in the
``sample_mflix`` database. 

The ``sample_mflix.synonymous_terms`` collection contains the following
documents: 

.. code-block:: json 
   
   {
     "mappingType": "equivalent",
     "synonyms": ["car", "vehicle", "automobile"]
   }
   
.. code-block:: json 

   {
     "mappingType": "explicit",
     "input": ["race"],
     "synonyms": ["contest", "rally"]
   }
   
.. code-block:: json 

   {
     "mappingType": "equivalent",
     "synonyms": ["dress", "apparel", "attire"]
   }
   
.. code-block:: json 

   {
     "mappingType": "explicit",
     "input": ["boat"],
     "synonyms": ["vessel", "sail"]
   }
