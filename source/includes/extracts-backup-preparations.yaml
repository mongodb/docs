  For collections created after initial sync, the Backup Daemon uses its
  own defaults for storing data. The Daemon will not replicate any
  WiredTiger options for a collection created after iniitial sync.

  .. important::

     The storage engine chosen for a backup is *independent* from the
     storage engine used by the Backup Database. If the :ref:`Backup
     Database <mms-backup-blockstore-database>` uses the MMAPv1 storage
     engine, it can store backup snapshots for WiredTiger backup jobs in
     its blockstore.
