Select Destination for the Snapshot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Select the :guilabel:`Delivery Method`:

   - Select ``Pull via Secure HTTP (HTTPS)`` to download the snapshot
     yourself. This option creates a **one-time** direct download link.

     **or**

   - Select ``Push via Secure Copy (SCP)`` to have |backup| download
     the snapshot. You can grant access by supplying MMS with a
     username and password to your server, or you can provide a
     username and grant access via SSH public key.

     To grant access via SSH public key,

     #. Go to the MMS "Settings" page, and select :guilabel:`Restore Settings`.

     #. Input a passphrase, and click on :guilabel:`Generate a New
        Public Key`. |backup| will generate and display a
        public key.

     #. Log in to your server using the same username you will supply
        in your restore request.

     #. Add your public key to the authorized hosts file for
        that user, generally found at ``/.ssh/authorized_keys``.

     .. note::

        For security reasons, you should remove this public key from
        the authorized hosts file once you have obtained your backup
        file.

#. Select the file :guilabel:`Format` option. The :guilabel:`Individual DB
   Files` option will fill the target directory with MongoDB files streamed in
   compressed form directly from the backup database. The individual database
   files are faster to construct, but require additional file space on the
   destination server. Selecting :guilabel:`Archive (tar.gz)` delivers database
   files in a single ``tar.gz`` file that must be extracted before reconstructing
   databases.

#. Click :guilabel:`Authenticate`.

Authenticate
~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Click the :guilabel:`Send auth code` to receive the
   authentication code via text.

#. Once you receive the authentication code on the number
   specified during registration, enter the code in the
   :guilabel:`Auth code` field.

#. Click on :guilabel:`Finalize Request`.

Backup Delivery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For replica sets, you will receive one .tar.gz file containing your
data; for sharded clusters, you will receive a series of .tar.gz
files.

Start :program:`mongod` Instance With Snapshot Data
---------------------------------------------------

#. Extract the files from the ``.tar.gz`` archive created by the
   backup service:

   .. code-block:: sh

      tar -zxvf <tarball-name>.tar.gz

#. Create a :mongodb:setting:`dbpath` for MongoDB's data files. You
   may either create a symbolic link pointing to the database files,
   *or* create the database path and migrate the data files.

   .. example::

      Use a command in the following form to create a symbolic link at
      ``/data/db`` pointing to the backup files.

      .. code-block:: sh

         ln -s <hash>-<rsname>-<time>/ /data/db

      Replace ``<hash>-<rsname>-<time>`` with the name of your
      snapshot file and ``/data/db`` with your data directory's
      address.

#. Start a :program:`mongod`, using your new data directory as its
   ``dbpath``:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --dbpath /data/db

   Replace ``/data/db`` with the path to data directory that holds the
   data files from the |backup| snapshot.

Set from Backup </tutorial/restore-replica-set-from-backup>` tutorial
