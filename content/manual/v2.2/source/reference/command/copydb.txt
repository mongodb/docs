.. dbcommand:: copydb

   The :dbcommand:`copydb` command copies a database from a remote
   host to the current host. The command has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { copydb: 1:
        fromhost: <hostname>,
        fromdb: <db>,
        todb: <db>,
        slaveOk: <bool>,
        username: <username>,
        nonce: <nonce>,
        key: <key> }

   All of the following arguments are optional:

   - slaveOk
   - username
   - nonce
   - key

   You can omit the ``fromhost`` argument, to copy one database to
   another database within a single MongoDB instance.

   You must run this command on the destination, or the ``todb``
   server.

   Be aware of the following behaviors:

   - :dbcommand:`copydb` can run against a :term:`slave` or a
     non-:term:`primary` member of a :term:`replica set`. In this case,
     you must set the ``slaveOk`` option to ``true``.

   - :dbcommand:`copydb` does not snapshot the database. If the state
     of the database changes at any point during the operation, the
     resulting database may be inconsistent.

   - You must run :dbcommand:`copydb` on the **destination server**.

   - The destination server is not locked for the duration of the
     :dbcommand:`copydb` operation. This means that
     :dbcommand:`copydb` will occasionally yield to allow other
     operations to complete.

   - If the remote server has authentication enabled, then you must
     include a username, nonce, and a key. The nonce is a one-time
     password that you request from the remote server using the
     :dbcommand:`copydbgetnonce` command. The ``key`` is a hash
     generated as follows:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        hex_md5(nonce + username + hex_md5(username + ":mongo:" + pass))

     If you need to copy a database and authenticate, it's easiest to use the
     shell helper:

     .. code-block:: javascript

         db.copyDatabase(<remote_db_name>, <local_db_name>, <from_host_name>, <username>, <password>)
