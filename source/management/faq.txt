User and Group Management
-------------------------

How do I reset my password?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can reset your password using the `password reset form
<https://mms.mongodb.com/user/resetPassword>`_.

How do I change my password?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can change your password by `resetting your password
<https://mms.mongodb.com/user/resetPassword>`_.

.. _password-requirements:

What are the password requirements?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/faq-mms-password-requirement.rst

Passwords for the `MongoDB Jira`_ instance and MMS are the same,
although the length and character requirements are different for Jira
and MMS.

How do I add a user to my company/group?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the user already has a `MongoDB Jira`_ or MMS account, you can add
their username to your group on the admin page.

If the user does not have a Jira account then they can `create a new
account <https://mms.mongodb.com/user/register/user>`_. After they have
created an account, you can add their username to the company/group on
the admin page.

Activity

.. _exposed-hosts-alert:

My alert email says my host(s) are exposed to the public Internet. What does that mean?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo: is that the email subject going forward?

Any alerts set to check if your host is exposed to the public internet will
attempt to connect to your servers occasionally as part of a vulnerability
check to help test your firewall configuration. This is a weak
security validation and should not replace other auditing or intrusion
detection system procedures.

If you configured a setting called :guilabel:`Exposed Db Host Check`, it is now
an alert you can edit or disable. Newly created groups have an exposed host
alert created and activated automatically, along with a monitoring down alert.
Existing groups must set the exposed host alert manually.

When enabled, this alert runs twice a month, on the first and fifteenth. Once
MMS finds an exposed host, the service will try to connect to the exposed host
every five minutes until the host is no longer accessible. The exposed host
alert email looks the same as other alert emails.

MMS attempts to connect with both the IP address and the non-canonical host
identifier you see in the :guilabel:`Name` field of the Hosts page.

See :doc:`/management/activity` to disable or modify the exposed host alerts.

How do I modify my alert settings?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can enable, disable, or modify alerts on the settings tab of the
*Activity* page.

How frequently can alerts be set?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alerts are processed on a 5 minute interval. Therefore, the minimum frequency
for an alert is 5 minutes.

Do Web or Database Hosting Companies Integrate with MMS ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Web hosting companies can offer the ability to use MMS with their hosted
MongoDB databases, for example, to set up software agents to monitor and backup
databases hosted on their servers. MongoDB has confirmed compatability with
MongoHQ, MongoLab, and Heroku. Implementation details depend on each
hosting company.
   
`MongoHQ`_ offers MMS upon request as part of their Database as a Service
(DaaS) business.

`MongoLab`_ offers MMS as part of their Database as a Service (DaaS) business.
MongoLab offers the service on their dedicated plans and shared replica set
plan. They also provide `instructions to tune MongoDB performance`_ with MMS on
their servers.

MongoHQ and MongoLab are MongoDB Advanced Partners.

`Heroku`_ offers web hosting with a `MongoHQ add-on`_ and `MongoLab add-on`_ to
use MongoDB databases from these database hosting companies. Heroku also offers
MMS monitoring of those databases with `detailed setup instructions`_.
