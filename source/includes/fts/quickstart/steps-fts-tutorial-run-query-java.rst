      Ensure that your ``CLASSPATH`` contains the following libraries.

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 30 70 

         * - ``junit``

   .. step:: Run a basic query.
      
      .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-basic-query-intro.rst
      
      a. Create a new file named ``RunQuery.java`` and paste the following code.

         .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-basic-query-desc.rst

         .. note:: 

            To run the sample code in your Maven environment, add the 
            following above the import statements in your file.

            .. code-block:: 

               package com.mongodb.drivers;

      #. Specify the ``<connection-string>``, then run the query:
