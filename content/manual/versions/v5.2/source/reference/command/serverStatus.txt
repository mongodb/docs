.. dbcommand:: serverStatus

   The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command returns a document that
   provides an overview of the database's state. Monitoring
   applications can run this command at a regular interval to
   collect statistics about the instance.

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1 } )

The value (i.e. ``1`` above) does not affect the operation of the
command. The ``db.serverStatus()`` command returns a large amount of
data. To return a specific object or field from the output append the
object or field name to the command.

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand({ serverStatus: 1}).metrics
   db.runCommand({ serverStatus: 1}).metrics.commands
   db.runCommand({ serverStatus: 1}).metrics.commands.update

:binary:`~bin.mongosh` provides the :method:`db.serverStatus()`
wrapper for the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command.

.. seealso::

   Much of the output of :dbcommand:`serverStatus` is also displayed
   dynamically by :binary:`~bin.mongostat`. See the
   :binary:`~bin.mongostat` command for more information.

Behavior
--------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/serverStatus-command-projection.rst

For example, the following operation suppresses the ``repl``,
``metrics`` and ``locks`` information in the output.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1, repl: 0, metrics: 0, locks: 0 } )

The following example includes
all :ref:`server-status-repl` information in the output:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1,  repl: 1 } )

Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The statistics reported by :dbcommand:`serverStatus` are reset when the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` server is restarted.

This command will always return a value, even on a fresh database. The
related command :method:`db.serverStatus()` does not always return a
value unless a counter has started to increment for a particular
metric.

After you run an update query, ``db.serverStatus()`` and
``db.runCommand({ serverStatus: 1})`` both return the same values.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      "arrayFilters" : NumberLong(0),
      "failed" : NumberLong(0),
      "pipeline" : NumberLong(0),
      "total" : NumberLong(1)
   }

Include ``mirroredReads``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the :serverstatus:`mirroredReads` information (available
starting in version 4.4) is not included in the output. To return
:serverstatus:`mirroredReads` information, you must explicitly specify
the inclusion:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1, mirroredReads: 1 } )

Include ``latchAnalysis``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the :serverstatus:`latchAnalysis` information (available
starting in version 4.4) is not included in the output. To return
:serverstatus:`latchAnalysis` information, you must explicitly specify
the inclusion:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1, latchAnalysis: 1 } )

.. _server-status-output:

Output
------

.. note::

   The output fields vary depending on the version of MongoDB,
   underlying operating system platform, the storage engine, and the
   kind of node, including :binary:`~bin.mongos`, :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
   :term:`replica set` member.

   For the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` output specific to the version of
   your MongoDB, refer to the appropriate version of the MongoDB Manual.

      "rollovers" : <num>
   },

.. serverstatus:: asserts

   A document that reports on the number of assertions raised since the
   MongoDB process started. While assert errors are typically uncommon,
   if there are non-zero values for the :serverstatus:`asserts`, you
   should examine the log file for more information. In many cases,
   these errors are trivial, but are worth investigating.

.. serverstatus:: asserts.regular

   The number of regular assertions raised since the MongoDB process
   started. Examine the log file for more information about these
   messages.

.. serverstatus:: asserts.warning

   .. versionchanged:: 4.0

   Starting in MongoDB 4.0, the field returns zero ``0``.

   In earlier versions, the field returns the number of warnings raised
   since the MongoDB process started.

   started. Examine the log file for more information about these
   messages.

.. serverstatus:: asserts.user

   The number of "user asserts" that have occurred since the last time
   the MongoDB process started. These are errors that user may
   generate, such as out of disk space or duplicate key. You can
   prevent these assertions by fixing a problem with your application
   or deployment. Examine the MongoDB log for more information.

.. serverstatus:: asserts.rollovers

   The number of times that the rollover counters have rolled over
   since the last time the MongoDB process started. The counters will
   rollover to zero after 2\ :superscript:`30` assertions. Use this
   value to provide context to the other values in the
   :serverstatus:`asserts` data structure.

   },

.. serverstatus:: globalLock

   A document that reports on the database's lock state.

   Generally, the :ref:`locks <locks>` document provides more detailed
   data on lock uses.

.. serverstatus:: globalLock.totalTime

   The time, in microseconds, since the database last started and
   created the :serverstatus:`globalLock`. This is approximately

   The total number of operations queued waiting for the lock (i.e.,
   the sum of :serverstatus:`globalLock.currentQueue.readers` and
   :serverstatus:`globalLock.currentQueue.writers`).

   A consistently small queue, particularly of shorter operations,
   should cause no concern. The
   :serverstatus:`globalLock.activeClients` readers and writers
   information provides context for this data.

.. serverstatus:: globalLock.currentQueue.readers

   clients and the read and write operations performed by these clients.

   Use this data to provide context for the
   :serverstatus:`globalLock.currentQueue` data.

.. serverstatus:: globalLock.activeClients.total

   The total number of internal client connections to the database
   including system threads as well as queued readers and writers.
   This metric will be higher than the total of ``activeClients.readers``

.. serverstatus:: opWriteConcernCounters

   A document that reports on the :doc:`write concerns
   </reference/write-concern>` specified by write operations to the

   More specifically, the :serverstatus:`opWriteConcernCounters`
   reports on the :ref:`w: \<value\> <wc-w>` specified by the write
   operations. The journal flag option (``j``) and the timeout option
   (``wtimeout``) of the write concerns does not affect the count. The
   count is incremented even if the operation times out.

   These numbers will grow over time until next restart. Analyze these
   values over time to track database utilization.

   .. note::

      The data in :serverstatus:`opcounters` treats operations
      that affect multiple documents, such as bulk insert or
      multi-update operations, as a single operation. See

.. serverstatus:: opcounters.getmore

   The total number of :dbcommand:`getMore` operations since the

      }

   These opcodes were deprecated in MongoDB 5.0 and support for these
   opcodes is removed in MongoDB 5.1. Starting in MongoDB 5.1,
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` refuses requests that use a deprecated
   opcode and increments the corresponding counter.

   ``OP_QUERY`` is an exception to the general rule.
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` continues to support ``hello`` and
   ``isMaster`` requests that use ``OP_QUERY``. :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   refuses any other ``OP_QUERY`` requests.

   The counters are reset when :binary:`~bin.mongod` starts.

   The resharding coordinator instructs each donor and recipient shard 
   primary, to rename the temporary sharded collection.
   The temporary collection becomes the new resharded collection.

   .. versionadded:: 5.0

.. serverstatus:: repl.primaryOnlyServices.RenameCollectionParticipantService

   Document that contains the state and number of instances of the
   ``RenameCollectionParticipantService``.

   The ``RenameCollectionParticipantService`` ensures that, after a shard 
   receives a 
   :manual:`renameCollection</reference/method/db.collection.renameCollection/>`
   request, the shard is able to resume the local rename in case of 
   system failure.

   .. versionadded:: 5.0

.. serverstatus:: repl.primaryOnlyServices.ShardingDDLCoordinator

   Document that contains the state and number of instances of the
   ``ShardingDDLCoordinator``.

   The ``ShardingDDLCoordinator`` service manages DDL operations for 
   :manual:`primary</core/replica-set-members/#std-label-replica-set-primary-member>`
   databases such as:
   :manual:`create database</core/databases-and-collections/#create-a-database>`,
   :manual:`drop database</reference/method/db.dropDatabase/>`,
   :manual:`renameCollection</reference/method/db.collection.renameCollection>`. 
   
   The ``ShardingDDLCoordinator`` ensures that one DDL operation for
   each database can happen at any one specific point in time within a 
   sharded cluster. 

   .. versionadded:: 5.0

.. serverstatus:: repl.primaryOnlyServices.ReshardingDonorService

   Document that contains the state and number of instances of the
   ``ReshardingDonorService``.

   Donors are the shards that own chunks of the sharded collection
   before the rename operation completes.

   The resharding coordinator instructs each donor and recipient shard 
   primary, to rename the temporary sharded collection.
   The temporary collection becomes the new resharded collection.

   .. versionadded:: 5.0

.. serverstatus:: repl.rbid

   :term:`Rollback <rollback>` identifier. Used to determine if a rollback has
   happened for this :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

.. serverstatus:: repl.replicationProgress

   An array with one document for each member of the replica set that
   reports replication process to this member. Typically this is the
   primary, or secondaries if using chained replication.

   To include this output, you must pass the ``repl`` option to the
   :dbcommand:`serverStatus`, as in the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.serverStatus({ "repl": 1 })
      db.runCommand({ "serverStatus": 1, "repl": 1 })

   The content of the :serverstatus:`repl.replicationProgress` section
   depends on the source of each member's replication. This section
   supports internal operation and is for internal and diagnostic use only.

.. serverstatus:: repl.replicationProgress[n].rid

   An ObjectId used as an ID for the members of the replica
   set. For internal use only.

.. serverstatus:: repl.replicationProgress[n].optime

   Information regarding the last operation from the :term:`oplog` that
   the member applied, as reported from this member.

.. serverstatus:: repl.replicationProgress[n].host

   The name of the host in ``[hostname]:[port]`` format for the member
   of the replica set.

.. serverstatus:: repl.replicationProgress[n].memberID

   The integer identifier for this member of the replica set.

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics

   A document which contains metrics on metadata refresh on sharded
   clusters.

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.countStaleConfigErrors

   The total number of times that threads hit stale config exception.
   Since a stale config exception triggers a refresh of the metadata,
   this number is roughly proportional to the number of metadata
   refreshes.

   *Only present when run on a shard.*

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.countDonorMoveChunkStarted

   The total number of times that the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command
   has started on the shard, of which this node is a member, as part of
   a :ref:`chunk migration process <chunk-migration-procedure>`. This
   increasing number does not consider whether the chunk migrations
   succeed or not.

   *Only present when run on a shard.*

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.totalDonorChunkCloneTimeMillis

   The cumulative time, in milliseconds, taken by the :ref:`clone phase
   of the chunk migrations <chunk-migration-procedure>` from this
   shard, of which this node is a member. Specifically, for each
   migration from this shard, the tracked time starts with the
   :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command and ends before the destination shard
   enters a catch-up phase to apply changes that occurred during the
   :ref:`chunk migrations <chunk-migration-procedure>`.

   *Only present when run on a shard.*

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.totalCriticalSectionCommitTimeMillis

   The cumulative time, in milliseconds, taken by the :ref:`update
   metadata phase of the chunk migrations <chunk-migration-procedure>`
   from this shard, of which this node is a member. During the update
   metadata phase, all operations on the collection are blocked.

   *Only present when run on a shard.*

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.totalCriticalSectionTimeMillis

   The cumulative time, in milliseconds, taken by the :ref:`catch-up
   phase and the update metadata phase of the chunk migrations
   <chunk-migration-procedure>` from this shard, of which this node is
   a member.

   To calculate the duration of the catch-up phase, subtract
   :serverstatus:`~shardingStatistics.totalCriticalSectionCommitTimeMillis` from
   :serverstatus:`~shardingStatistics.totalCriticalSectionTimeMillis`:

   the move has succeeded or not).

   *Only present when run on a shard.*

   .. versionadded:: 4.2

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.countDocsDeletedOnDonor

   Cumulative, always-increasing count of documents that have been
   deleted on this member during chunk migration where the member acted
   as the primary of the donor shard.

   *Only present when run on a shard.*

   .. versionadded:: 4.2

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.countDonorMoveChunkLockTimeout

   Cumulative, always-increasing count of chunk migrations that were
   aborted due to lock acquisition timeouts, where the member acted as
   the primary of the donor shard.

   *Only present when run on a shard.*

   .. versionadded:: 4.2

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.unfinishedMigrationFromPreviousPrimary

   The number of unfinished migrations left by the previous
   primary after an election. This value is only updated after
   the newly-elected :binary:`~bin.mongod` completes the transition to
   primary.

   *Only present when run on a shard.*

   .. versionadded:: 4.4

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.catalogCache

   A document with statistics about the cluster's routing information cache.

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.catalogCache.numDatabaseEntries

   The total number of database entries that are currently in the
   catalog cache.

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.catalogCache.numCollectionEntries

   The total number of collection entries (across all databases) that
   are currently in the catalog cache.

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.catalogCache.countStaleConfigErrors

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.numHostsTargeted

   Indicates the number of shards targeted for ``CRUD`` operations and 
   aggregation commands. When a ``CRUD`` operation or aggregation
   command is run, the following metrics will be incremented.

   .. include:: /includes/fact-server-status-num-hosts-targeted.rst

   .. note:: 

      Running the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command on :binary:`mongos` 
      will provide insight into the CRUD and aggregation operations that
      run on a sharded cluster.

      Multi-shard operations can either be 
      :ref:`scatter-gather<sharding-query-patterns>`
      or shard specific. Multi-shard scatter-gather operations can
      :ref:`consume more resources<sharding-troubleshooting-scatter-gather>`.
      By using the

          - has inserted entries into ``config.chunks`` for ranges based
            on the new shard key.
          - has inserted entries into ``config.tags`` for any zones
            associated with the new shard key.

          The coordinator informs participant shards to begin the
          resharding operation. The coordinator then waits until all

.. serverstatus:: transactions

   *Available on mongod in 3.6.3+ and on mongos in 4.2+.*

   When run on a :binary:`~bin.mongod`, a document with data about the
   :doc:`retryable writes </core/retryable-writes>` and
   :doc:`transactions </core/transactions>`.

   When run on a :binary:`~bin.mongos`, a document with data about the
   :doc:`transactions </core/transactions>` run on the instance.

.. serverstatus:: transactions.retriedCommandsCount

   |mongod-only|

   The total number of retry attempts that have been received after the
   corresponding retryable write command has already been committed.
   That is, a retryable write is attempted even though the write has
   previously succeeded and has an associated record for the
   transaction and session in the :data:`config.transactions`
   collection, such as when the initial write response to the client is
   lost.

   .. note::

      MongoDB does not re-execute the committed writes.

   The total is across all sessions.

   The total does not include any retryable writes that may happen
   internally as part of a chunk migration.

   .. versionadded:: 3.6.3

.. serverstatus:: transactions.retriedStatementsCount

   |mongod-only|

   The total number of write statements associated with the retried
   commands in :serverstatus:`transactions.retriedCommandsCount`.

   .. note::

      MongoDB does not re-execute the committed writes.

   The total does not include any retryable writes that may happen
   internally as part of a chunk migration.

   .. versionadded:: 3.6.3

.. serverstatus:: transactions.transactionsCollectionWriteCount

   |mongod-only|

   The total number of writes to the :data:`config.transactions`
   collection, triggered when a new retryable write statement is
   committed.

   For update and delete commands, since only single document
   operations are retryable, there is one write per statement.

   For insert operations, there is one write per batch of documents
   inserted, except when a failure leads to each document being
   inserted separately.

   The total includes writes to a server's :data:`config.transactions`
   collection that occur as part of a migration.

   .. versionadded:: 3.6.3

.. [#oplog-change]

   Starting in version 4.2, MongoDB creates as many oplog entries as
   necessary to encapsulate all write operations in a transaction
   whereas in version 4.0, the write operations in a transaction must
   fit within a single oplog entry. See :ref:`txn-oplog-size-limit` for
   details.

.. note::

   The following is not an exhaustive list.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.uri

   A string. For internal use by MongoDB.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.async

   A document that returns statistics related to the asynchronous
   operations API. This is unused by MongoDB.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.block-manager

   A document that returns statistics on the block manager operations.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache

   A document that returns statistics on the cache and page evictions
   from the cache.

   The following describes some of the key
   :serverstatus:`wiredTiger.cache` statistics:

   .. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache.maximum bytes configured

      Maximum cache size.

   .. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache.bytes currently in the cache

      Size in byte of the data currently in cache. This value should
      not be greater than the ``maximum bytes configured`` value.

   .. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache.unmodified pages evicted

      Main statistics for page eviction.

   .. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache.tracked dirty bytes in the cache

      Size in bytes of the dirty data in the cache. This value should
      be less than the ``bytes currently in the cache`` value.

   .. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache.pages read into cache

      Number of pages read into the cache.
      :serverstatus:`wiredTiger.cache.pages read into cache` with
      the :serverstatus:`wiredTiger.cache.pages written from
      cache` can provide an overview of the I/O activity.

   .. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache.pages written from cache

      Number of pages written from the cache.
      :serverstatus:`wiredTiger.cache.pages written from cache`
      with the :serverstatus:`wiredTiger.cache.pages read into
      cache` can provide an overview of the I/O activity.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/wt-cache-setting.rst

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.connection

   A document that returns statistics related to WiredTiger connections.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cursor

   A document that returns statistics on WiredTiger cursor.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.data-handle

   A document that returns statistics on the data handles and sweeps.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.log

   A document that returns statistics on WiredTiger's write ahead log
   (i.e. the journal).

   .. seealso::

      :ref:`journaling-wiredTiger`

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.reconciliation

   A document that returns statistics on the reconciliation process.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.session

   A document that returns the open cursor count and open session count
   for the session.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.thread-yield

   A document that returns statistics on yields during page
   acquisitions.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.transaction

   A document that returns statistics on transaction checkpoints and
   operations.

   .. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.transaction.transaction checkpoint most recent time (msecs)

      Amount of time, in milliseconds, to create the most recent
      checkpoint. An increase in this value under stead write load may
      indicate saturation on the I/O subsystem.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.concurrentTransactions

   A document that returns information on the number of concurrent of
   read and write transactions allowed into the WiredTiger storage
   engine. These settings are MongoDB-specific.

   To change the settings for concurrent
   reads and write transactions, see
   :parameter:`wiredTigerConcurrentReadTransactions` and
   :parameter:`wiredTigerConcurrentWriteTransactions`.

.. _server-status-writebacksqueued:
.. _server-status-write-backs-queued:

writeBacksQueued
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

   "writeBacksQueued" : <boolean>,

.. serverstatus:: writeBacksQueued

   A boolean that indicates whether there are operations from a
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance queued for retrying. Typically, this
   value is false.  See also :term:`writeBacks`.

.. _memory-status:
.. _server-status-memory:

mem
~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

   "mem" : {
      "bits" : <int>,
      "resident" : <int>,
      "virtual" : <int>,
      "supported" : <boolean>
   },


.. serverstatus:: mem

   A document that reports on the system architecture of the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` and current memory use.

.. serverstatus:: mem.bits

   A number, either ``64`` or ``32``, that indicates whether the
   MongoDB instance is compiled for 64-bit or 32-bit architecture.

.. serverstatus:: mem.resident

   The value of :serverstatus:`mem.resident` is roughly equivalent to
   the amount of RAM, in mebibyte (MiB), currently used by the database
   process. During normal use, this value tends to grow. In dedicated
   database servers, this number tends to approach the total amount of
   system memory.

.. serverstatus:: mem.virtual

   :serverstatus:`mem.virtual` displays the quantity, in mebibyte
   (MiB), of virtual memory used by the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process.

.. serverstatus:: mem.supported

   A boolean that indicates whether the underlying system supports
   extended memory information. If this value is false and the system
   does not support extended memory information, then other
   :serverstatus:`mem` values may not be accessible to the database
   server.


.. serverstatus:: mem.note

   The field :serverstatus:`mem.note` appears if
   :serverstatus:`mem.supported` is false.

   The :serverstatus:`mem.note` field contains the text: ``"not all mem
   info support on this platform"``.

.. serverstatus:: metrics

   A document that returns various statistics that reflect the current
   use and state of a running :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.aggStageCounters

   A document that reports on the use of
   :doc:`aggregation pipeline stages
   </reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/>`. The fields
   in :serverstatus:`metrics.aggStageCounters` are the names of
   aggregation pipeline stages. For each pipeline stage,
   :dbcommand:`serverStatus` reports the number of times that stage
   has been executed.

   *New in version 4.4 (4.2.6 and 4.0.19).* 
   *Updated in version 5.2 (and 5.0.6).*

.. _server-status-apiVersions:

.. serverstatus:: metrics.apiVersions

   A document with client applications and the version of Stable 
   API which they are configured with. Consider the following when
   viewing ``metrics.apiVersions``:

   - The only possible returned values for each ``appname`` are 
     ``default`` or ``1``.

   - API version metrics are retained for 24 hours. If
     no commands are issued with a specific API version from an 
     application in the past 24 hours, that ``appname`` and API version 
     will be removed from the metrics. This also applies to the 
     ``default`` API version metric.

   - Set the ``appname`` when connecting to a MongoDB instance by 
     specifying the ``appname`` in the connection URI. ``?appName=ZZZ`` 
     sets the ``appname`` to ``ZZZZ``.

   - Drivers accessing the Stable API can set a default ``appname``.

   - If no ``appname`` is configured, a default value will be 
     automatically populated based on the product. For example, for a 
     :compass:`MongoDB Compass </>` connection with no ``appname`` in 
     the URI, the metric returns: ``'MongoDB Compass': [ 'default' ]``.

   *New in version 5.0.* 

.. serverstatus:: metrics.operatorCounters

   A document that reports on the use of :ref:`aggregation pipeline
   <aggregation-pipeline>` operators and expressions.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.operatorCounters.expressions

   A document with a number that indicates how often
   :ref:`aggregation-expression-operators` ran.

   To get metrics for a specific operator, such as the greater-than
   operator (:expression:`$gt`), append the operator to the command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1 } ).metrics.operatorCounters.expressions.$gt

   .. versionadded:: 5.0

.. serverstatus:: metrics.operatorCounters.match

   A document with a number that indicates how often
   :ref:`match expressions <query-projection-operators-top>` ran.

   :ref:`Match expression operators <query-projection-operators-top>`
   also increment as part of an aggregation pipeline :pipeline:`$match`
   stage. If the ``$match`` stage uses the :query:`$expr` operator, the
   counter for ``$expr`` increments, but the component counters do not
   increment. 

   Consider the following query: 

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      db.matchCount.aggregate(
         [
            { $match:
               {  $expr: { $gt: [ "$_id", 0 ] } }
            }
         ]
      )

   The counter for ``$expr`` increments when the query runs. The
   counter for ``$gt`` does not.

   operations ran using a dollar (``$``) prefixed name. The value does
   not report the exact number of operations.  

   When an :term:`upsert` operation creates a new document, it is
   considered to be an ``insert`` rather than an ``update``.

   .. versionadded:: 5.0

   write operation (i.e. a ``w`` value greater than ``1``.)

.. serverstatus:: metrics.getLastError.wtimeouts

   The number of times that :term:`write concern` operations have timed
   out as a result of the ``wtimeout`` threshold. This number
   increments for both default and non-default write concern
   specifications.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.getLastError.default

   A document that reports on when a default :ref:`write concern
   <write-concern>` was used (meaning, a non-``clientSupplied`` write
   concern). The possible origins of a default write concern are:

   - ``implicitDefault``
   - ``customDefault``
   - ``getLastErrorDefaults``

   Refer to the following table for information on
   each possible write concern origin, or ``provenance``:

   .. seealso::

      :serverstatus:`metrics.repl.apply.batchSize`

.. serverstatus:: metrics.repl.buffer

   MongoDB buffers oplog operations from the replication sync source
   buffer before applying oplog entries in a
   batch. :serverstatus:`metrics.repl.buffer` provides a way to

   from the oplog :term:`cursor` as part of the oplog replication
   process.

   .. TODO move the documentation of getmore into some central place

.. serverstatus:: metrics.repl.network.getmores.num

   :serverstatus:`metrics.repl.network.getmores.num` reports the
   total number of ``getmore`` operations, which are operations that
   request an additional set of operations from the replication sync
   source.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.repl.network.getmores.totalMillis

   :serverstatus:`metrics.repl.network.getmores.totalMillis`
   reports the total amount of time required to collect data from
   ``getmore`` operations.

   .. note::

      This number can be quite large, as MongoDB will wait for more
      data even if the ``getmore`` operation does not initial return
      data.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.repl.network.getmores.numEmptyBatches

   The number of empty ``oplog`` batches a secondary receives from its
   sync source. A secondary receives an empty batch if it is fully
   synced with its source and either:

   - The ``getmore`` times out waiting for more data, or

   - The sync source's majority commit point has advanced since the
     last batch sent to this secondary.

   For a primary, if the instance was previously a secondary, the
   number reports on the empty batches received when it was a
   secondary. Otherwise, for a primary, this number is ``0``.

   .. versionadded:: 4.4

.. serverstatus:: metrics.repl.network.notPrimaryLegacyUnacknowledgedWrites

.. serverstatus:: metrics.repl.reconfig

   A document containing the number of times that member ``newlyAdded``
   fields were automatically removed by the primary. When a member is
   first added to the replica set, the member's ``newlyAdded`` field is
   set to ``true``.

   .. versionadded:: 5.0

.. serverstatus:: metrics.repl.reconfig.numAutoReconfigsForRemovalOfNewlyAddedFields

   The number of times that ``newlyAdded`` member fields were
   automatically removed by the primary. When a member is first added to
   the replica set, the member's ``newlyAdded`` field is set to
   ``true``. After the primary receives the member's heartbeat response
   indicating the member state is :replstate:`SECONDARY`,
   :replstate:`RECOVERING`, or :replstate:`ROLLBACK`, the primary
   automatically removes the member's ``newlyAdded`` field. The
   ``newlyAdded`` fields are stored in the :data:`local.system.replset`
   collection.
