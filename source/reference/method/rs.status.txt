   .. |dbcommand| replace:: :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` command

   This output reflects the current status of the replica set, using

   of the replica set.

Output
------

For an example and details on the output, see :ref:`replSetGetStatus
<rs-status-output>`.

If you run the :binary:`~bin.mongosh` helper method :method:`rs.status()` 
(or the :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` command) on a member during its 
:ref:`initial sync <replica-set-initial-sync>` (i.e. :replstate:`STARTUP2` 
state), the command returns :data:`replSetGetStatus.initialSyncStatus`
metrics.
      
Once the member completes its initial sync, the
:data:`replSetGetStatus.initialSyncStatus` metrics becomes unavailable.
