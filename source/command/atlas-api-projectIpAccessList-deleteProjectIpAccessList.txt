`Public Preview: please provide feedback at <https://feedback.mongodb.com/forums/930808-atlas-cli>`_: Removes one access list entry from the specified project's IP access list.

Each entry in the project's IP access list contains one IP address, one CIDR-notated block of IP addresses, or one AWS Security Group ID. MongoDB Cloud only allows client connections to the cluster from entries in the project's IP access list. To use this resource, the requesting API Key must have the Project Owner role. This resource replaces the whitelist resource. MongoDB Cloud removed whitelists in July 2021. Update your applications to use this new resource. The /groups/{GROUP-ID}/accessList endpoint manages the database IP access list. This endpoint is distinct from the orgs/{ORG-ID}/apiKeys/{API-KEY-ID}/accesslist endpoint, which manages the access list for MongoDB Cloud organizations.

This command is autogenerated and corresponds 1:1 with the Atlas API endpoint https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/v2/#tag/Project-IP-Access-List/operation/deleteProjectIpAccessList.

For more information and examples, see the referenced API documentation linked above.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 10 10 60

   * - Name
     - Type
     - Required
     - Description
   * - --entryValue
     - /
     - true
     - Access list entry that you want to remove from the project's IP access list. This value can use one of the following: one AWS security group ID, one IP address, or one CIDR block of addresses. For CIDR blocks that use a subnet mask, replace the forward slash (/) with its URL-encoded value (`%2F`). When you remove an entry from the IP access list, existing connections from the removed address or addresses may remain open for a variable amount of time. The amount of time it takes MongoDB Cloud to close the connection depends upon several factors, including:
       
       - how your application established the connection,
       - how MongoDB Cloud or the driver using the address behaves, and
       - which protocol (like TCP or UDP) the connection uses.
   * - --envelope
     - envelope
     - false
     - Flag that indicates whether Application wraps the response in an envelope JSON object. Some API clients cannot access the HTTP response headers or status code. To remediate this, set envelope=true in the query. Endpoints that return a list of results use the results object as an envelope. Application adds the status parameter to the response body.
   * - --groupId
     - string
     - true
     - Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies your project. Use the [/groups](#tag/Projects/operation/listProjects) endpoint to retrieve all projects to which the authenticated user has access.
       
       **NOTE**: Groups and projects are synonymous terms. Your group id is the same as your project id. For existing groups, your group/project id remains the same. The resource and corresponding endpoints use the term groups.
   * - -h, --help
     - 
     - false
     - help for deleteProjectIpAccessList
   * - --output
     - string
     - false
     - preferred api format, can be ["json", go-template] This value defaults to "json".
   * - --output-file
     - string
     - false
     - file to write the api output to. This flag is required when the output of an endpoint is binary (ex: gzip) and the command is not piped (ex: atlas command > out.zip)
   * - --pretty
     - 
     - false
     - Flag that indicates whether the response body should be in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prettyprint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prettyprint</a> format.
   * - --version
     - string
     - false
     - api version to use when calling the api call [options: "2023-01-01"], defaults to the latest version or the profiles api_version config value if set This value defaults to "2023-01-01".
