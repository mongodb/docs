"Aggregation operations process data records and return computed results. "
"Aggregation operations group values from multiple documents together, and"
" can perform a variety of operations on the grouped data to return a "
"single result. MongoDB provides three ways to perform aggregation: the "
":ref:`aggregation pipeline <aggregation-framework>`, the :ref:`map-reduce"
" function <aggregation-map-reduce>`, and :ref:`single purpose aggregation"
" methods <single-purpose-agg-operations>`."

"MongoDB's :doc:`aggregation framework </core/aggregation-pipeline>` is "
"modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines. Documents enter a "
"multi-stage pipeline that transforms the documents into an aggregated "
"result."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/aggregation.txt:32
msgid ""
"The most basic pipeline stages provide *filters* that operate like "
"queries and *document transformations* that modify the form of the output"
" document."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/aggregation.txt:36
msgid ""
"Other pipeline operations provide tools for grouping and sorting "
"documents by specific field or fields as well as tools for aggregating "
"the contents of arrays, including arrays of documents. In addition, "
"pipeline stages can use :ref:`operators <aggregation-expression-"
"operators>` for tasks such as calculating the average or concatenating a "
"string."

"MongoDB also provides :doc:`map-reduce </core/map-reduce>` operations to "
"perform aggregation. In general, map-reduce operations have two phases: a"
" *map* stage that processes each document and *emits* one or more objects"
" for each input document, and *reduce* phase that combines the output of "
"the map operation. Optionally, map-reduce can have a *finalize* stage to "
"make final modifications to the result. Like other aggregation "
"operations, map-reduce can specify a query condition to select the input "
"documents as well as sort and limit the results."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/aggregation.txt:72
msgid ""
"Map-reduce uses custom JavaScript functions to perform the map and reduce"
" operations, as well as the optional *finalize* operation. While the "
"custom JavaScript provide great flexibility compared to the aggregation "
"pipeline, in general, map-reduce is less efficient and more complex than "
"the aggregation pipeline."
msgstr ""

"Starting in MongoDB 2.4, certain :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell functions and"
" properties are inaccessible in map-reduce operations. MongoDB 2.4 also "
"provides support for multiple JavaScript operations to run at the same "
"time. Before MongoDB 2.4, JavaScript code executed in a single thread, "
"raising concurrency issues for map-reduce."
