====================================
Deploy a Standalone MongoDB Instance
====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can deploy a :term:`standalone` MongoDB instance managed by MMS. Use
standalone instances for testing and development.
**Do not** use these deployments, which lack replication and high
availability, for production systems. For all production deployments
use replica sets. See :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set` for
production deployments.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must have an existing server to which to deploy. You can use your
localhost or another machine to which you have access. You can also use a
server on Amazon Web Services (AWS). See :doc:`/tutorial/add-servers`
for more about configuring and provisioning AWS servers.
