title: "Run a simple |fts| query on the ``sample_supplies.monthlyPhoneTransactions`` collection."
ref: run-first-query-sample-supplies
content: |

  The following query counts the number of months in monthlyPhoneTransactions
  with total sales greater than or equal to ``10000`` dollars:

  .. code-block:: javascript

      db.monthlyPhoneTransactions.aggregate([
        {
            $search: {
                "index": "monthlySalesIndex",
                "range": { 
                    "gt": 10000,
                    "path": ["sales_price"]
                }
            }
        },
        {
          $count: 'months_w_over_10000'
        },
      ])

  The above query returns ``4``, 
  indicating that only 4 months out of all the months in the
  ``monthlyPhoneTransactions`` materialized view had total sales 
  greater than or equal to 10000 dollars. This result reflects data 
  from both the ``sample_supplies.sales`` and 
  ``sample_supplies.purchaseOrders`` collections.
