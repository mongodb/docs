You can use Relational Migrator to migrate one legacy application at a
time to MongoDB. Depending on your application's needs, you can migrate
either with or without downtime.

Migrate during Scheduled Downtime
---------------------------------

If your application does not require constant uptime, such as in the
case of an internal application, you can have the migration occur during
scheduled downtime. Migrating during downtime is the easiest way to
configure and complete the migration process.

When you start the migration process, Relational Migrator takes a
snapshot of the data on the legacy application and migrates the data
from that point in time. During the migration process, your legacy
application can remain online to support incoming reads, but cannot
support incoming writes. The length of the migration process depends on
several factors, such as the amount of data being migrated and your
connection speed.

After the migration completes, take your legacy application offline and
launch your new application.

Migrate without Downtime
------------------------

If your application must remain online to support reads and writes
during the migration process, you can use Change Data Capture (CDC) to
migrate data without downtime. This process is called a **continuous
sync migration**.

When you start a continuous sync migration, Relational Migrator takes a
snapshot of the data on the legacy application and tracks database
updates in near real time. During the migration process, your source and
destination databases remain in sync.

After the continuous sync migration completes, you can transfer users to
the new application and shut down the legacy application.

To learn more about sync jobs, see :ref:`rm-sync-jobs`.

Currently Unsupported Migration Scenarios
-----------------------------------------

Relational Migrator currently does not support the following migration
scenarios:

- Migrating multiple applications through a phased migration without
  downtime. In this scenario, multiple legacy applications are
  decommissioned and migrated to the new database while the original
  database still supports writes. The migration uses :abbr:`CDC (Change
  Data Capture)` to keep the legacy application in sync with the
  destination database.

- Migrating an operational data store. Depending on your workload, this
  scenario could involve :abbr:`CDC (Change Data Capture)` running
  indefinitely without completing.

The preceding scenarios require long-running :abbr:`CDC (Change Data
Capture)`, or in some cases involve :abbr:`CDC (Change Data Capture)`
running indefinitely. Therefore, these scenarios are not recommended
with Relational Migrator.

Relational Migrator will support more migration scenarios and use cases
in future releases.
