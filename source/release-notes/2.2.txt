Upgrading
---------

MongoDB 2.2 is a standard, incremental production release and works as
a drop-in replacement for MongoDB 2.0.

Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~

If your MongoDB deployment uses authentication, upgrade your drivers
(i.e. client libraries) and :program:`mongos` instances before
upgrading your :program:`mongod` instances.

.. TODO insert the following line if we eventually have a section on
   this change. See the :ref:`driver changes <2.2-driver-changes>`
   section for more information.

Read through all release notes before upgrading, and ensure that no
changes will affect your deployment.

2.2 processes can inter-operate with 2.0 and 1.8 tools and processes
in replica sets and sharded clusters, if you are not running with
authentication. As a result, you can safely upgrade the
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` components of your deployment
in any order.

.. _2.2-upgrade-standalone:

Upgrading a Standalone ``mongod``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Download the v2.2 binaries from the `MongoDB Download Page`_.

#. Shutdown your :program:`mongod` instance, replace the existing
   binary with the 2.2 :program:`mongod` binary and restart MongoDB.

.. _`MongoDB Download Page`: http://downloads.mongodb.org/

.. _2.2-upgrade-replica-set:

Upgrading a Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While you may upgrade your replica set in any order, to minimize
downtime, use the following procedure:

#. Upgrade the :term:`secondary` members of the set one at a time by
   shutting down the :program:`mongod` and replacing the binary with
   the 2.2 binary.

#. Use the :func:`rs.stepDown()` to step down the primary to allow
   normal :ref:`failover <replica-set-failover>` procedure.

   :func:`rs.stepDown()` and :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` provide for
   shorter and more consistent failover procedures than simply
   shutting down the primary directly.

   When the primary has stepped down, shut the instance down and
   upgrade by replacing the :program:`mongod` binary with the 2.2
   binary.

.. _2.2-upgrade-shard-cluster:

Upgrading a Shard Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your cluster uses authentication, use the following upgrade
procedure:

- Upgrade all :program:`mongos` instances *first*, in any order.

- Upgrade all of the :program:`mongod` config server instances *one at
  a time*. When you have *less* than *three* config servers active,
  the cluster will be read-only which will prevent (and abort) all
  chunk migrations and chunk splits.

- Upgrade all remaining cluster components. Use the :ref:`upgrade
  procedure for replica sets <2.2-upgrade-replica-set>` for each of
  the shards and the :ref:`stand alone <2.2-upgrade-standalone>`
  procedure for each of the config servers. You may upgrade the
  components of your cluster in any order.

If your cluster *does not* use authentication, you may upgrade the
components of the cluster in any order, using the :ref:`upgrade
procedure for replica sets <2.2-upgrade-replica-set>` for each of the
shards and the :ref:`stand alone <2.2-upgrade-standalone>` procedure
for each of the config servers.

Major Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Aggregation Framework
`````````````````````

The aggregation framework makes it possible to do aggregation
operations without needing to use :term:`map-reduce`. The
:dbcommand:`aggregate` exposes the aggregation framework, and the
:func:`db.collection.aggregate()` helper in the :program:`mongo` shell
provides an interface to these operations. Consider the following
resources for background on the aggregation framework and its use:

- Documentation: :doc:`/applications/aggregation`

- Reference: :doc:`/reference/aggregation`

- Examples: :doc:`/tutorial/aggregation-examples`

TTL Collections
```````````````

TTL collections remove stale data from a collection, using a special
index and a background thread that deletes expired documents every
minute. These collections are useful as an alternative to
:term:`capped collections <capped collection>` in some cases, for data
warehousing and caching cases including: machine generated event data,
logs, and session information that only need to persist in a database
for a limited period of time.

For more information, see the :doc:`/tutorial/expire-data` tutorial.

Concurrency Improvements
````````````````````````

In 2.2 MongoDB increases the database's capability for concurrent
operations using with two key improvements:

#. :issue:`DB Level Locking <SERVER-4328>`
#. :issue:`Improved Yielding on Page Faults <SERVER-3357>`

To reflect these changes, MognODB now provides changed and improved
reporting for concurrency and use, see the :ref:`locks` and
:ref:`server-status-record-stats` in :doc:`server status
</reference/server-status>` and in the output of
:func:`db.currentOp()` as well as :doc:`mongotop
</reference/mongotop>` and :doc:`mongostat </reference/mongostat>` and
in .

.. TODO add links to current op output documentation when it happens.

Tag Aware Sharding
``````````````````

:wiki:`Documentation <Tag+Aware+Sharding>`

.. TODO see kristina's blog post.

Fully Supported Read Preference Semantics
`````````````````````````````````````````

All MongoDB clients and drivers now support full :ref:`read
preferences <replica-set-read-preference>` including consistent
support for a full range of :ref:`read preference modes
<replica-set-read-preference-modes>` and :ref:`tag sets
<replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>`. This support extends to the
:program:`mongos` and applies similarly to both single replica sets,
and replica sets that provide components of a shard cluster.

Additional read preference support now exists in the :program:`mongo`
shell using the :func:`reaPref() <cursor.readPref()>` cursor method.

.. including tagging

Compatibility Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Authentication Changes
``````````````````````

In order to provide more reliable and robust support for
authentication clients, including drivers and :program:`mongos`
instances.

If your :program:`mongod` instances or cluster is running with
authentication:

- In sharded environments, 2.0 version :program:`mongos` instances are
  **not** compatible with 2.2 shard clusters running with
  authentication. Use the :ref:`upgrade procedure for shard clusters
  <2.2-upgrade-shard-cluster>` and upgrade all :program:`mongos`
  instances to prevent operational difficulty.

- For all drivers, use the latest release of your driver and check
  its release notes.

Drivers and :program:`mongos` instances that connect to
:program:`mongod` instances that do *not* have authentication enabled
are not affected by this issue.

.. _2.2-findandmodify-returns-null:

``findAndModify`` Returns Null Value for Upserts
````````````````````````````````````````````````

In version 2.2, for :term:`upsert` operations, :dbcommand:`findAndModify`
commands will now return the following output:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {'ok': 1.0, 'value': null}

In the :program:`mongo` shell, :dbcommand:`findAndModify` operations
running as upserts will only output a ``null`` value.

Previously, in version 2.0 these operations would return an empty
document, e.g. ``{ }``.

See: :issue:`SERVER-6226`.

Naming
~~~~~~

Restrictions on Database Names
``````````````````````````````

Database names can no longer contain the following characters:

.. code-block:: none

   /\. "*<>:|?

The names of the data files include the database name.
If you attempt upgrade a database instance with one or more of these characters,
:program:`mongod` will refuse to start.

Change the name of these databases before upgrading.

Added Build Flag to Use System Libraries
````````````````````````````````````````

The Boost library, version 1.49, is now embeded in the MongoDB
code base.

.. TODO help the verbs

If you want to build MongoDB binaries using system Boost libraries,
you can pass ``scons`` the ``--use-system-boost`` flag, as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

   scons --use-system-boost

There is also a flag in ``scons`` if you want to build MongoDB using
all system libraries rather than the included versions of the
libraries, if desired. To build MongoDB with system libraries for all
libraries, use the following arguments to ``scons``:

.. code-block:: sh

   scons --use-system-all

See the :issue:`SERVER-3829` and :issue:`SERVER-5172` issues for more
information.
