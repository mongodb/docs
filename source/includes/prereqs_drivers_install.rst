- If you are using MongoDB in the Cloud (Atlas), you will need to :doc:`/guides/cloud/connectionstring`

- If you plan on using a on-premise instance of MongoDB, you will need to:
  
  - :doc:`/guides/server/install`
  - :ref:`Enable authentication <enable-auth-procedure>`
    

  .. note::

     Without authentication enabled, an on-premise MongoDB instance is not secure.
