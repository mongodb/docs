   You can either:

   - Copy the |mdb-shell| binary into a directory listed in your ``PATH``
     variable, such as ``/usr/local/bin`` (Update
     ``/path/to/mongosh`` with your installation directory as
     appropriate)

     .. code-block:: sh

       sudo cp /path/to/mongosh /usr/local/bin/

   - Create a symbolic link to the |mdb-shell| binary from a directory listed in
     your ``PATH`` variable, such as ``/usr/local/bin`` (Update
     ``/path/to/mongosh`` with your installation directory as
     appropriate):

     .. code-block:: sh

       sudo ln -s  /path/to/mongosh /usr/local/bin/
