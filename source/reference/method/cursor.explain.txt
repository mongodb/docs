.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. EDITS to cursor.explain.txt must be carried over to the operator
   explain.txt and vice versa

.. method:: cursor.explain()

   The :method:`cursor.explain()` method provides information on the
   query plan. The query plan is the plan the server uses to find the
   matches for a query. This information may be useful when optimizing
   a query.

   :param boolean verbose:

          Specifies the level of detail to include in the output. If
          ``true`` or ``1``, include the ``allPlans`` and ``oldPlan``
          fields in the :doc:`output document
          </reference/explain>`.

   :returns: A :doc:`document </reference/explain>` that
             describes the process used to return the query results.

   Retrieve the query plan by appending :method:`~cursor.explain()` to
   a :method:`~db.collection.find()` query, as in the following
   example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.products.find().explain()

   For details on the output, see :doc:`/reference/explain`.

   :method:`explain <cursor.explain()>` runs the actual query to
   determine the result. Although there are some differences between
   running the query with :method:`explain <cursor.explain()>` and
   running without, generally, the performance will be similar between
   the two. So, if the query is slow, the :method:`explain
   <cursor.explain()>` operation is also slow.

   Additionally, the :method:`explain <cursor.explain()>` operation reevaluates a set
   of candidate query plans, which may cause the :method:`explain <cursor.explain()>`
   operation to perform differently than a normal query. As a result,
   these operations generally provide an accurate account of *how*
   MongoDB would perform the query, but do not reflect the length of
   these queries.

   To determine the performance of a particular index, you can use
   :method:`hint() <cursor.hint()>`  and in conjunction with
   :method:`explain() <cursor.explain()>`, as in the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.products.find().hint( { type: 1 } ).explain()

   When you run :method:`explain <cursor.explain()>` with
   :method:`hint() <cursor.hint()>`, the query optimizer does not
   reevaluate the query plans.


   .. note::

      In some situations, the :method:`explain() <cursor.explain()>`
      operation may differ from the actual query plan used by MongoDB
      in a normal query.

      The :method:`explain() <cursor.explain()>` operation evaluates
      the set of query plans and reports on the winning plan for the
      query. In normal operations the query optimizer caches winning
      query plans and uses them for similar related queries in the
      future.  As a result MongoDB may sometimes select query plans
      from the cache that are different from the plan displayed using
      :method:`explain <cursor.explain()>`.
