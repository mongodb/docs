.. _4.0-remove-mongodb-cr:

Remove Support for ``MONGODB-CR``
---------------------------------

Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB removes support for the deprecated
MongoDB Challenge-Response (``MONGODB-CR``) authentication mechanism.

Since version 3.0, MongoDB has not supported the creation of
``MONGODB-CR`` users unless the deployment had been upgraded from a 2.6
or earlier deployment that already had ``MONGODB-CR`` users and had not
upgraded the authentication schema.

If your deployment has user credentials stored in ``MONGODB-CR``
schema, you must upgrade to :ref:`Salted Challenge Response
Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) <authentication-scram>` **before** you
upgrade to version 4.0. For information on upgrading to ``SCRAM``, see
:doc:`/release-notes/3.0-scram`.

.. _4.0-remove-authschemaupgrade:

Removal of ``authSchemaUpgrade`` Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.0 removes the ``authSchemaUpgrade`` command . The command,
available in MongoDB 3.0 through MongoDB 3.6, supports the upgrade
process for systems with ``MONGDB-CR`` users to ``SCRAM`` users.

If your deployment has user credentials stored in ``MONGODB-CR``
schema, you must upgrade to :ref:`Salted Challenge Response
Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) <authentication-scram>` **before** you
upgrade to version 4.0. For information on upgrading to ``SCRAM``, see
:doc:`/release-notes/3.0-scram`.

.. _4.0-remove-mongodb-cr-copydb:

Remove ``MONGODB-CR`` Support from ``db.copyDatabase()`` and ``copydb``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The method :method:`db.copyDatabase()` cannot copy from a
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance that enforces ``MONGODB-CR``
authentication.

The command :dbcommand:`copydb` cannot copy from a
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance that enforces ``MONGODB-CR``
authentication. In conjunction with this change, MongoDB 4.0 removes
the ``copydbgetnonce`` command.

Deprecate MMAPv1
----------------

Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB deprecates the :ref:`storage-mmapv1`.

To change your MMAPv1 storage engine deployment to
:doc:`/core/wiredtiger`, see:

- :doc:`/tutorial/change-standalone-wiredtiger`

- :doc:`/tutorial/change-replica-set-wiredtiger`

- :doc:`/tutorial/change-sharded-cluster-wiredtiger`

.. _4.0-compat-remove-pv0:

Remove ``pv0`` for Replica Sets
-------------------------------

MongoDB 4.0 removes the deprecated replica set protocol version 0
``pv0``.

Before upgrading to MongoDB 4.0, you must upgrade to :rsconf:`pv1
<protocolVersion>`.

To upgrade to ``pv1``, connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the
replica set primary and perform the following sequence of operations:

.. code-block:: sh

   cfg = rs.conf();
   cfg.protocolVersion=1;
   rs.reconfig(cfg);

To reduce the likelihood of :writeconcern:`w:1 <\<number\>>` rollbacks,
you can also reconfigure the replica set to a higher
:rsconf:`settings.catchUpTimeoutMillis` setting.

For more information on ``pv1``, see
:doc:`/reference/replica-set-protocol-versions`.

Remove Master-Slave Replication
-------------------------------

MongoDB 4.0 removes support for the deprecated master-slave
replication. Before you can upgrade to MongoDB 4.0, if your deployment
uses master-slave replication, you must upgrade to a replica set.

To convert your master-slave replication, see
:ref:`convert-master-slave-to-replica-set`.

.. _4.0-compatibility-general:

General
-------

- MongoDB 4.0 removes the ``mongoperf`` binary.

- The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command now always returns ``0`` for
  the :serverstatus:`asserts.warning` field.

- You cannot specify :option:`--noIndexBuildRetry <mongod --noIndexBuildRetry>` or
  :setting:`storage.indexBuildRetry` with :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` or
  :setting:`replication.replSetName`. That is, you cannot use
  :option:`--noIndexBuildRetry <mongod --noIndexBuildRetry>`
  :setting:`storage.indexBuildRetry` for a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance
  that is part of a replica set.

- The geospatial query operators :query:`$near` and
  :query:`$nearSphere` now supports querying on sharded collections.

- MongoDB 4.0 deprecates the :dbcommand:`geoNear` command. Use one of
  the following operations instead.

  - :pipeline:`$geoNear` aggregation stage.

  - :query:`$near` query operator.

  - :query:`$nearSphere` query operator.

- For the :dbcommand:`create` command (and the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
  shell :method:`db.createCollection()` method), you cannot set the
  option ``autoIndexId`` to ``false`` when creating collections in
  databases other than the ``local`` database.

- The :pipeline:`$currentOp` aggregation stage, the
  :dbcommand:`currentOp` command, and :method:`db.currentOp()` helper
  no longer return the ``threadId`` field in their outputs.

- MongoDB 4.0 removes the limit on the amount of data that can be
  :doc:`rolled back </core/replica-set-rollbacks>`. In previous
  versions, a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance will not roll back more than
  300 megabytes of data and requires manual intervention if more than
  300 megabytes of data need to be rolled back.

- The following fields returned from :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` are
  deprecated:

  - :data:`replSetGetStatus.syncingTo`

  - :data:`replSetGetStatus.members[n].syncingTo`

  Use :data:`replSetGetStatus.replSetGetStatus.syncSourceHost` and
  :data:`replSetGetStatus.members[n].syncSourceHost` instead.
