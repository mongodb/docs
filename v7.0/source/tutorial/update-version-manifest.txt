You can use Automation to install and upgrade MongoDB instances in your
deployment. You need to give |onprem| a list of which versions can be
installed. The complete list of all possible MongoDB editions and
versions is called the :opsmgr:`version manifest </reference/glossary/#std-term-version-manifest>`.

If you configure the {+mdbagent+} to use remote or hybrid downloads,
|onprem| updates the version manifest automatically.

If you configure the {+mdbagent+} to use local downloads, you must 
update the version manifest manually.

To learn more about **Remote Mode**, **Hybrid Mode**, and **Local 
Mode**, see :ref:`om-modes`.
