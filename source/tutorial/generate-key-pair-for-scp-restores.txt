Overview
--------

When you restore a snapshot, you can choose to access the files
through a download link, or have |mms| copy the restore files
via SCP to your server. To use SCP, you must generate a key pair that |mms| can
use to transmit the restore.

.. note::

   Windows machines do not come with ``SCP`` and require additional setup
   outside the scope of this manual.

   For security reasons, you should remove this public key from the authorized
   hosts file once you have obtained your backup file.
