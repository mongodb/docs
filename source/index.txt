The `MongoDB Connector for Spark
<https://www.mongodb.com/products/spark-connector>`_ provides
integration between MongoDB and Apache Spark.

.. note::

   Version 10.x of the {+connector-long+} is an all-new 
   connector based on the latest Spark API. Install and migrate to 
   version 10.x to take advantage of new capabilities, such as tighter 
   integration with 
   :ref:`Spark Structured Streaming <streaming-mode>`.

   Version 10.x uses the new namespace 
   ``com.mongodb.spark.sql.connector.MongoTableProvider``. 
   This allows you to use old versions of the connector 
   (versions 3.x and earlier) in parallel with version 10.x.

   To learn more about the new connector and its advantages, see the 
   `MongoDB announcement blog post <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/new-mongodb-spark-connector>`__.

With the connector, you have access to all Spark libraries for use with
MongoDB datasets: ``Dataset`` for analysis with SQL (benefiting from
automatic schema inference), streaming, machine learning, and graph
APIs. You can also use the connector with the Spark Shell.

The {+connector-long+} is compatible with the following
versions of Apache Spark and MongoDB:
