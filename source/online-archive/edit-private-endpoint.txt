MongoDB supports |aws| private endpoints using the `{+aws-pl+} 
<https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/>`__ feature only for Online 
Archives. You can edit the comment associated with a private endpoint 
for online archives from the |service| User Interface and |api|. 

.. note:: 

   You can edit the private endpoints for a dedicated cluster. To learn 
   more, see :ref:`private-endpoint`.

Edit Private Endpoint Through the User Interface 
------------------------------------------------

To edit the comment associated with a private endpoint from your 
|service| UI: 

.. include:: /includes/steps/oa-edit-privatelink.rst

Edit Private Endpoint Through the API 
-------------------------------------

To edit a private endpoint for an online archive through the |api|, 
send a ``POST`` request to the :ref:`privateNetworkSettings 
<api-online-archive-pvt-link-create-one>` endpoint with the 
unique ID of the private endpoint to edit. If there is no change to the 
comment associated with the specified endpoint, |service| makes no 
change to the endpoint ID list. If there is a change to the comment 
associated with the specified endpoint, |service| updates the 
``comment`` value only in the endpoint ID list.

To learn more about the 
|api| syntax and options, see 
:ref:`api-online-archive-pvt-link-create-one`.
