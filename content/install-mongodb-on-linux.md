# Install MongoDB Community Edition From Tarball


## Overview

Compiled versions of MongoDB Community Edition for Linux provide a simple
option for installing MongoDB Community Edition for other Linux systems without
supported packages.

Note: Do not use this installation method unless you have a specific need that the available [Linux Packages](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux/#recommended-linux-install) do not address.

Note: Starting in MongoDB 3.6, MongoDB binaries, [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) and [``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos), bind to localhost by default. Previously, starting in MongoDB 2.6, only the binaries from the official MongoDB RPM (Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora Linux, and derivatives) and DEB (Debian, Ubuntu, and derivatives) packages bind to localhost by default. For more details, see [Localhost Binding Compatibility Changes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-compatibility/#bind-ip-compatibility).


## Install MongoDB Community Edition

MongoDB only provides archives for 64-bit builds of Linux. Follow the
installation procedure appropriate for your system.

Note: To install a different version of MongoDB, please refer to that version's documentation. For example, see version [3.2](../install-mongodb-on-linux/).


### Install for 64-bit Linux


#### Step 1: Download the binary files for the desired release of MongoDB.

Download the binaries from the [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center).

For example, to download the latest release through the shell, issue
the following:

```sh

curl -O https://fastdl.mongodb.org/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.6.0-rc7.tgz

```


#### Step 2: Extract the files from the downloaded archive.

For example, from a system shell, you can extract through the ``tar`` command:

```sh

tar -zxvf mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.6.0-rc7.tgz

```


#### Step 3: Copy the extracted archive to the target directory.

Copy the extracted folder to the location from which MongoDB will run.

```sh

mkdir -p mongodb
cp -R -n mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.6.0-rc7/ mongodb

```


#### Step 4: Ensure the location of the binaries is in the ``PATH`` variable.

The MongoDB binaries are in the ``bin/`` directory of the archive. To
ensure that the binaries are in your ``PATH``, you can modify your
``PATH``.

For example, you can add the following line to your shell's
``rc`` file (e.g. ``~/.bashrc``):

```sh

export PATH=<mongodb-install-directory>/bin:$PATH

```

Replace ``<mongodb-install-directory>`` with the path to the extracted
MongoDB archive.


## Run MongoDB Community Edition

Most Unix-like operating systems limit the system resources that a
session may use. These limits may negatively impact MongoDB operation.
See [UNIX ulimit Settings](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/ulimit) for more information.


### Step 1: Create the data directory.

Before you start MongoDB for the first time, create the directory to
which the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) process will write data. By default, the
[``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) process uses the ``/data/db`` directory. If you create
a directory other than this one, you must specify that directory in the
``dbpath`` option when starting the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) process
later in this procedure.

The following example command creates the default ``/data/db`` directory:

```sh

mkdir -p /data/db

```


### Step 2: Set permissions for the data directory.

Before running [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) for the first time, ensure that the
user account running [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) has read and write permissions
for the directory.


### Step 3: Run MongoDB.

To run MongoDB, run the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) process at the system prompt.
If necessary, specify the path of the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) or the data
directory. See the following examples.


#### Run without specifying paths

If your system ``PATH`` variable includes the location of the
[``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) binary and if you use the default data directory
(i.e., ``/data/db``), simply enter ``mongod`` at the system prompt:

```sh

mongod

```


#### Specify the path of the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod)

If your ``PATH`` does not include the location of the
[``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) binary, enter the full path to the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod)
binary at the system prompt:

```sh

<path to binary>/mongod

```


#### Specify the path of the data directory

If you do not use the default data directory (i.e., ``/data/db``),
specify the path to the data directory using the ``--dbpath`` option:

```sh

mongod --dbpath <path to data directory>

```


### Step 4: Begin using MongoDB.

To help you start using MongoDB, MongoDB provides [Getting
Started Guides](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/getting-started/#getting-started) in various driver editions. See
[Getting Started](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/getting-started/#getting-started) for the available editions.

Before deploying MongoDB in a production environment, consider the
[Production Notes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/production-notes) document.

Later, to stop MongoDB, press ``Control+C`` in the terminal where the
[``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) instance is running.
