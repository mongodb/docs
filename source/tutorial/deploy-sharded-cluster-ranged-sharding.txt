Overview
--------

In ranged-based sharding, MongoDB automatically divides data into contiguous
ranges determined by the :term:`shard key` values. In this model, documents with
"close" shard key values are likely to be in the same :term:`chunk` or
:term:`shard`. This allows for efficient queries where read operations target documents
within a contiguous range. However, both read and write performance may
decrease with poor shard key selection. See :ref:`sharding-ranged-shard-key`.

If you already have a sharded cluster deployed, skip to 
:ref:`deploy-ranged-sharded-cluster-shard-collection`.

Atlas, CloudManager and OpsManager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are currently using or are planning to use Atlas, Cloud Manager
or Ops Manager, refer to their respective manual for instructions on
deploying a :term:`sharded cluster`:

- `Create a Cluster (Atlas) <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/create-new-cluster/>`_

- :mms-docs:`Deploy a Sharded Cluster (Cloud Manager) </tutorial/deploy-sharded-cluster>`

- :opsmgr:`Deploy a Sharded Cluster (Ops Manager) </tutorial/deploy-sharded-cluster>`.

Considerations
--------------

Operating System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial uses the :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`
programs. Windows users should use the :program:`mongod.exe` and
:program:`mongos.exe` programs instead.

IP Binding
~~~~~~~~~~

Use the :setting:`bind_ip` option to ensure that MongoDB listens for
connections from applications on configured addresses.

.. versionchanged:: 3.6

   .. include:: /includes/fact-default-bind-ip.rst

Security
~~~~~~~~

This tutorial does *not* include the required steps for configuring
:doc:`/core/security-internal-authentication` or :doc:`/core/authorization`.
See :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-sharded-cluster-with-keyfile-access-control` for a
tutorial on deploying a sharded cluster with a
:ref:`keyfile<internal-auth-keyfile>`.

In production environments, sharded clusters should employ at
minimum :doc:`/core/security-x.509` security for internal authentication
and client access:

- For details on using x.509 for internal authentication, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-member-authentication`.

- For details on using x.509 for client authentication, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication`.

.. note::

   Enabling internal authentication also enables
   :doc:`/core/authorization`.

Deploy Sharded Cluster with Ranged Sharding
-------------------------------------------

.. _deploy-ranged-sharded-cluster-config-server:

Create the Config Server Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps deploys a config server replica set.

For a production deployment, deploy a config server replica set with at
least three members. For testing purposes, you can create a
single-member replica set.

For this tutorial, the config server replica set members are associated
with the following hosts:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Config Server Replica Set Member
     - Hostname

   * - Member 0
     - ``cfg1.example.net``

   * - Member 1
     - ``cfg2.example.net``

   * - Member 2
     - ``cfg3.example.net``

.. include:: /includes/steps/deploy-sharded-cluster-config-server-noauth.rst

Once the config server replica set (CSRS) is initiated and up, proceed
to creating the shard replica sets.

Create the Shard Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a production deployment, use a replica set with at least three
members for each shard. For testing purposes, you can create a
single-member replica set.

.. include:: /includes/steps/deploy-sharded-cluster-shard-replica-noauth.rst

Connect a ``mongos`` to the Sharded Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/deploy-sharded-cluster-connect-noauth.rst

Once you have connected the :program:`mongo` shell to the
:program:`mongos`, continue to the next procedure to add shards to
the cluster.

Add Shards to the Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the :program:`mongo` shell connected to the :program:`mongos`, use
the :method:`sh.addShard()` method to add each shard to the cluster. If
the shard is a replica set, specify the name of the replica set and
specify a member of the set.

.. tip::

   In production deployments, *all* shards should be replica sets.

The following operation adds a single shard replica set to the cluster:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.addShard( "<replSetName>/s1-mongo1.example.net:27017")

Repeat to add all shards.

If in a development environment, the shard is a standalone
:program:`mongod` instance, specify the instance's hostname and port.
The following operation is an example of adding a standalone
:program:`mongod` shard to the cluster:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.addShard( "s1-mongo1.example.net:27018")

.. _deploy-ranged-sharded-cluster-shard-database:

Enable Sharding for a Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the :program:`mongo` shell connected to the :program:`mongos`, use
the :method:`sh.enableSharding()` method to enable sharding on the
target database. Enabling sharding on a database makes it possible to
shard collections within a database.


.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.enableSharding("<database>")

.. _deploy-ranged-sharded-cluster-shard-collection:

Shard a Collection using Ranged Sharding
----------------------------------------

From the :program:`mongo` shell connected to the :program:`mongos`, use
the :method:`sh.shardCollection()` method to shard a collection.

.. note:: 

   You must have :ref:`enabled sharding
   <deploy-ranged-sharded-cluster-shard-database>` for the database
   where the collection resides. See
   :ref:`deploy-hashed-sharded-cluster-shard-database`.


If the collection already contains data, you must create an index on the
:term:`shard key` using the :method:`db.collection.createIndex()` method before
using :method:`~sh.shardCollection()`.

If the collection is empty, MongoDB creates the index as part of
:method:`sh.shardCollection()`.

The following operation shards the target collection using the
:doc:`ranged</core/ranged-sharding>` sharding strategy.

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.shardCollection("<database>.<collection>", { <shard key> : <direction> } )

Your selection of shard key affects the efficiency of sharding, as well as
your ability to take advantage of certain sharding features such as
:ref:`zones <zone-sharding>`. See the selection considerations listed
in the :ref:`sharding-ranged-shard-key`.
