Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to authenticate to MongoDB using the
authentication mechanisms available in the MongoDB Enterprise
Edition. When you connect to MongoDB, you can use an authentication
mechanism to establish trust between the driver and the server.

The {+driver-short+} supports authenticating to a Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server by using the
:ref:`LDAP (PLAIN) <rust-LDAP>` enterprise authentication mechanism.

.. note:: GSSAPI/Kerberos Authentication
   
   The driver does not support the GSSAPI/Kerberos authentication
   mechanism, but you can use other methods to authenticate this way. To
   learn more about these methods, see :manual:`Kerberos Authentication
   </core/kerberos/>` in the Server manual.

.. seealso::

   To authenticate to MongoDB by using mechanisms available in
   the MongoDB Community Edition, see the guide on :ref:`<rust-authentication>`.

   To learn more about connecting to a MongoDB deployment, see the
   :ref:`rust-connect-to-mongodb`.

To select a specific authentication mechanism, specify the
mechanism, your credentials, and other necessary information
in the options of your connection string or in a ``Credential`` struct.

.. _rust-LDAP:

Authenticate to LDAP (PLAIN)
----------------------------

You can authenticate to a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server 
by using your directory server username and password.

The name of the authentication mechanism is ``PLAIN`` instead of LDAP
because the mechanism uses the PLAIN Simple Authentication and
Security Layer (SASL) defined in `RFC-4616
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4616>`__.

.. warning::

   This authentication mechanism sends your password to the server in
   plaintext. Use this mechanism only after enabling TLS
   on your connection to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities in
   your application.
   
   To learn more, see :manual:`TLS/SSL (Transport Encryption)
   </core/security-transport-encryption/>` in the Server manual.

Example
~~~~~~~

To specify the ``PLAIN`` authentication mechanism, set the
``mechanism`` field of your ``Credential`` struct to
``AuthMechanism::Plain``. This example specifies the
authentication mechanism by using the following placeholders:

- ``username``: Your LDAP username
- ``password``: Your LDAP password

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/enterprise-auth.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-ldap
   :end-before: end-ldap

.. note:: Authentication Database

   Because your credentials are stored outside of MongoDB, you must use the
   ``$external`` database for authentication. The ``source`` field of
   the ``Credential`` struct defaults to ``$external``, so you can omit
   this field.

Alternatively, you can authenticate by using a connection string URI by
setting the value of the ``authMechanism`` connection string option to ``PLAIN``.
This example shows how to specify the ``PLAIN`` authentication mechanism in
a connection string URI by using the following placeholders:

- ``username``: Your LDAP username
- ``password``: Your LDAP password
- ``hostname``: The network address of your MongoDB server

.. code-block:: rust
   
   let uri = "mongodb://<username>:<password>@<hostname>/?authSource=$external&authMechanism=PLAIN";

.. _rust-mongodb-oidc:

MONGODB-OIDC
------------

.. important::

   The MONGODB-OIDC authentication mechanism requires MongoDB Server
   v7.0 or later running on a Linux platform.

The {+driver-short+} supports OpenID Connect (**OIDC**) authentication for **workload
identities**. A workload identity is an identity you assign to a
software workload, such as an application, service, script, or
container, to authenticate and access other services and resources.

The following sections describe how to use the MONGODB-OIDC
authentication mechanism to authenticate to various platforms.

To learn more about the MONGODB-OIDC authentication mechanism, see
:manual:`OpenID Connect Authentication </core/security-oidc/>` and
:manual:`MongoDB Server Parameters </reference/parameters/#mongodb-parameter-param.oidcIdentityProviders>`
in the Server manual.

.. _rust-mongodb-oidc-azure-imds:

Azure IMDS
~~~~~~~~~~

If your application runs on an Azure VM, or otherwise uses the
`Azure Instance Metadata Service <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/instance-metadata-service>`__
(IMDS), you can authenticate to MongoDB by using the {+driver-short+}'s
built-in Azure support.

You can configure OIDC for Azure IMDS by setting the ``mechanism`` field of your
``Credential`` struct to ``AuthMechanism::MongoDbOidc``. This example specifies
the authentication mechanism by using the following placeholders:

- ``username``:  If you're using an Azure managed identity, set this to the
  client ID of the managed identity. If you're using a service principal to
  represent an enterprise application, set this to the application ID of the
  service principal.
- ``mechanism_properties``: Set the ``ENVIRONMENT`` property to ``azure`` and
  the ``TOKEN_RESOURCE`` to the value of the audience parameter configured
  on your MongoDB deployment.

The following code example shows how to set these options when creating a
``Client``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/enterprise-auth.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-azure-imds
   :end-before: end-azure-imds
   :emphasize-lines: 2-5

.. _rust-mongodb-oidc-gcp-imds:

GCP IMDS
~~~~~~~~

If your application runs on a Google Compute Engine VM, or otherwise uses the
`GCP Instance Metadata Service <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/metadata/querying-metadata>`__,
you can authenticate to MongoDB by using the {+driver-short+}'s built-in GCP
support.

You can configure OIDC for GCP IMDS by setting the ``mechanism`` field of your
``Credential`` struct to ``AuthMechanism::MongoDbOidc``. Then, specify the
authentication mechanism by setting the following values in the
``mechanism_properties`` field:

- ``ENVIRONMENT``: Set this property to ``gcp``.
- ``TOKEN_RESOURCE``: Set this property to the value of the audience parameter configured
  on your MongoDB deployment.

The following code example shows how to set these options when creating a
``Client``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/enterprise-auth.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-gcp-imds
   :end-before: end-gcp-imds
   :emphasize-lines: 2-4

Kubernetes
~~~~~~~~~~

If your application runs on a Kubernetes cluster, you can authenticate to MongoDB by using
the {+driver-short+}'s built-in Kubernetes support.

You can configure OIDC for Kubernetes by setting the ``mechanism`` field of your
``Credential`` struct to ``AuthMechanism::MongoDbOidc``. Then, specify the
authentication mechanism by setting the ``ENVIRONMENT`` property to ``k8s`` in the
``mechanism_properties`` field.

The following code example shows how to set these options when creating a
``Client``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/enterprise-auth.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-kubernetes
   :end-before: end-kubernetes
   :emphasize-lines: 2-4

.. _rust-mongodb-oidc-custom-callback:

Custom Callback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+driver-short+} doesn't offer built-in support for all platforms, including
the AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). To use OIDC to authenticate against
unsupported platforms, you must define a custom callback function.

The following code is an example implementation of a custom callback for an EKS
cluster. First, set the ``oidc_callback`` field of your ``Credential`` struct to
``oidc::Callback::machine``. Then, read the access token from a path set in the
``AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`` environment variable. Finally, set the value of
the ``access_token`` field of the ``IdpServerResponse`` struct. Optionally, set
the values of the ``expires`` and ``refresh_token`` fields.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/enterprise-auth.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-custom-callback-machine
   :end-before: end-custom-callback-machine
   :emphasize-lines: 3, 5-7

When the workforce identity authentication process involves human interaction,
you must configure the client by setting the ``oidc_callback`` field of your
``Credential`` struct to ``oidc::Callback::human`` instead of
``oidc::Callback::machine``. The {+driver-short+} uses the callback in the
following process:

1. The driver retrieves the Identity Provider Information (IDPInfo) for the
   provided username.
#. The callback negotiates with the IDP to obtain an ``access_token``, and any
   potential ``refresh_token`` and timeout values, if configured. The callback
   returns a ``Result<IdpServerInfo>``.

The following example defines a custom callback to handle workforce identity. To
customize this example for your use case, replace ``<human flow>`` with your own
custom flow. Refer to `Authorization Code Flow with OIDC
<https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/oidc-conformant-authentication/oidc-adoption-auth-code-flow>`__
for more details.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/enterprise-auth.rs

   :end-before: end-custom-callback-user
