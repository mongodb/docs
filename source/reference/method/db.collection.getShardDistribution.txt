Definition
----------

.. method:: db.collection.getShardDistribution()


   .. include:: /includes/fact-mongosh-shell-method.rst

   Prints the data distribution statistics for a :term:`sharded
   <sharding>` collection.

Compatibility 
-------------

This method is available in deployments hosted in the following environments:

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-no-free.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Syntax
------

The :method:`~db.collection.getShardDistribution()` method has the following 
form: 

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.getShardDistribution()

Output
------

.. note::

  The behavior of ``getShardDistribution()`` changed in MongoDB Shell
  version 2.3.3:
  
  - Starting in MongoDB Shell version 2.3.3, ``getShardDistribution()``
    only contains regular sharded data and does not account for
    :term:`orphaned documents <orphaned document>`.
    
  - Prior to MongoDB Shell version 2.3.3, ``getShardDistribution()``
    accounts for both regular sharded data and orphaned documents
    pending deletion. If the collection contains orphaned documents,
    ``getShardDistribution()`` might indicate that the collection is
    unbalanced even if the collection is balanced in terms of regular
    data. The shard containing orphaned data has more documents and
    greater data size, but the same number of chunks compared to other
    shards.

Sample Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is a sample output for the distribution of a sharded
collection:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Shard shard01 at shard01/localhost:27018
   {
     data: '38.14MB',
     docs: 1000003,
     chunks: 2,
     'estimated data per chunk': '19.07B',
     'estimated docs per chunk': 500001
   }
   ---
   Shard shard02 at shard02/localhost:27019
   {
     data: '38.14B',
     docs: 999999,
     chunks: 3,
     'estimated data per chunk': '12.71B',
     'estimated docs per chunk': 333333
   }
   ---
   Totals
   {
     data: '76.29B',
     docs: 2000002,
     chunks: 5,
     'Shard shard01': [ '50 % data', '50 % docs in cluster', '40B avg obj size on shard' ],
     'Shard shard02': [ '49.99 % data', '49.99 % docs in cluster', '40B avg obj size on shard' ]
   }

Output Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Shard shard01 at <host-a>   {
     data: <size-a>,
     docs: <count-a>,
     chunks: <number of chunks-a>,

   Totals

   }

   * - Output
     - Description 

   * - ``<shard-x>`` 
     - A string that holds the shard name.

   * - ``<host-x>``
     - A string that holds the host name(s).

   * - ``<size-x>``
     - A number that includes the size of the data,
       including the unit of measure (e.g. ``b``, ``Mb``).

   * - ``<count-x>``
     - A number that reports the number of documents in the shard.

   * - ``<number of chunks-x>``
     - A number that reports the number of chunks in the shard.

   * - ``<size-x>/<number of chunks-x>``
     - A calculated value that reflects the estimated data size per chunk 
       for the shard, including the unit of measure (e.g. ``b``, ``Mb``).

   * - ``<count-x>/<number of chunks-x>``
     - A calculated value that reflects the estimated number of documents 
       per chunk for the shard.

   * - ``<stats.size>``
     - A value that reports the total size of the data in the sharded collection,
       including the unit of measure.

   * - ``<stats.count>``
     - A value that reports the total number of documents in the sharded 
       collection.

   * - ``<calc total chunks>`` 
     - A calculated number that reports the number of chunks from all shards. 
       For example:

       .. code-block:: bash

          <calc total chunks> = <number of chunks-a> + <number of chunks-b>

   * - ``<estDataPercent-x>``
     - A calculated value that reflects, for each shard, the data size as the 
       percentage of the collection's total data size. For example:

       .. code-block:: bash

          <estDataPercent-x> = <size-x>/<stats.size>

   * - ``<estDocPercent-x>``
     - A calculated value that reflects, for each shard, the number of
       documents as the percentage of the total number of documents for the
       collection. For example:

       .. code-block:: bash

          <estDocPercent-x> = <count-x>/<stats.count>

   * - ``stats.shards[ <shard-x> ].avgObjSize``
     - A number that reflects the average object size, including the unit 
       of measure, for the shard.
