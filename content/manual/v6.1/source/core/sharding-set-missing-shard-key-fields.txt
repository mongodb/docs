If you have missing shard key fields, you can set the shard key field to
``null``. If you want to set the missing shard key field to a
non-``null`` value, see :ref:`update-shard-key`.

To perform the update, you can use the following operations on a
:binary:`~bin.mongos`:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60

   * - Command
     - Method
     - Description

   * - | :ref:`update <command-update-shard-key-modification>` with
       | ``multi: true``

     - | :ref:`db.collection.updateMany() <updateMany-sharded-collection>`

     - - Can be used to set the missing key value to ``null`` only.

       - Can be performed inside or outside a transaction.

       - Can be performed as a retryable write or not.

       - For additional requirements, refer to the specific
         command/method.

   * - | :ref:`update <command-update-shard-key-modification>`  with
       | ``multi: false``

     - | :ref:`db.collection.replaceOne() <replaceOne-missing-shard-key>`
       | :ref:`db.collection.updateOne() <updateOne-missing-shard-key>`

     - - Can be used to set the missing key value to ``null`` or any
         other value.

       - The update to set missing shard key fields **must** meet one of
         the following requirements:

         - the filter of the query contains an equality condition on the full
           shard key in the query
         - the filter of the query contains an exact match on _id
         - the update targets a single shard

       - To set to a non-``null`` value, refer to
         :ref:`update-shard-key`.

       - For additional requirements, refer to the specific
         command/method.

   * - :ref:`findAndModify <cmd-findAndModify-missing-shard-key>`
     - | :ref:`db.collection.findOneAndReplace() <findOneAndReplace-missing-shard-key>`
       | :ref:`db.collection.findOneAndUpdate() <findOneAndUpdate-missing-shard-key>`
       | :ref:`db.collection.findAndModify() <method-findAndModify-missing-shard-key>`

     - - Can be used to set the missing key value to ``null`` or any
         other value.

       - When setting missing shard key fields with a method that
         explicitly updates only one document, the update **must** meet
         one of the following requirements:

         - the filter of the query contains an equality condition on
           the full shard key in the query
         - the filter of the query contains an exact match on _id
         - the update targets a single shard

       - Missing key values are returned when matching on ``null``. To
         avoid updating a key value that is ``null``, include additional
         query conditions as appropriate.

       - To set to a non-``null`` value, refer to
         :ref:`update-shard-key`.

       - For additional requirements, refer to the specific
         command/method.

   * -
     - | :method:`db.collection.bulkWrite()`
       | :method:`Bulk.find.replaceOne()`
       | :method:`Bulk.find.updateOne()`
       | :method:`Bulk.find.update()`

     - - To set to a ``null`` value,  you can specify multiple shard
         key modifications in the bulk operation.

       - When setting missing shard key fields with a method that
         explicitly updates only one document, the update **must** meet
         one of the following requirements:

         - the filter of the query contains an equality condition on
           the full shard key in the query
         - the filter of the query contains an exact match on _id
         - the update targets a single shard

       - To set to a non-``null`` value, refer to
         :ref:`update-shard-key`.

       - For additional requirements, refer to the underlying
         command/method.

Example
-------

Consider a ``sales`` collection which is sharded on the ``location``
field. Some documents in the collection have no ``location`` field. A
missing field is considered the same as a null value for the field. To
explicitly set these fields to ``null``, run the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.sales.updateOne(
     { _id: 12345, location: null },
     { $set: { location: null } }
   )

When setting missing shard key fields with
:method:`db.collection.updateOne()` or another method that explicitly
updates only one document, the update **must** meet one of the following
requirements:

- the filter of the query contains an equality condition on the full
  shard key in the query
- the filter of the query contains an exact match on _id
- the update targets a single Shard
