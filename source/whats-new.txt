The 2.27 driver release includes the following new features:

- Implements the ``Equals()`` method for serializers in LINQ3.

- Ensures that read and write concerns are not applied to Atlas Search Index
  Helper commands to avoid errors.

- Disallows the use of the comma character in ``authMechanismProperties``
  connection string values when using the ``MONGODB-OIDC`` authentication
  mechanism. 

- Fixes a translation bug that caused an error during serialization involving
  numbers of different sizes.

- Adds support for Linux distributions that use the ``libdl.so.2`` library.

For more information about this release, see the :github:`v2.27 release notes

  parameter more than once.
