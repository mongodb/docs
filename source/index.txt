.. admonition:: |compass| is available in the following versions

   - General Availability.

   - Beta Version.

   To download either versions, go to the `MongoDB Download Center
   <https://www.mongodb.com/downloads?jmp=docs#compass>`_.

|compass| is designed to allow
users to easily analyze and understand the contents of
their data collections within MongoDB and
perform queries, without requiring knowledge of MongoDB

|compass| provides users with a graphical view of their MongoDB
schema by randomly sampling a subset of documents from the
collection. Sampling documents minimizes
performance impact on the database and can produce results quickly.

for further information on sampling.
