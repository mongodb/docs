ref: atlas-deployment
level: 4
stepnum: 1
content: |
  If you don't already have an Atlas deployment, :doc:`create one
  </cloud/atlas>` now. You'll need
  a `cluster tier
  <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/create-new-cluster/#c-select-the-cluster-tier>`_
  of ``M10`` or larger to perform Live Migration.

ref: login-compose
level: 4
stepnum: 2
content: |
  Log in to your `Compose account <https://app.compose.io/session/new>`_
  and navigate to the deployment you want to migrate to Atlas.

  .. note::

     It will be helpful during the migration process to keep one
     browser window open on your Compose deployment console and one
     window open on your `Atlas console <https://cloud.mongodb.com>`_.

title: Create an oplog user
ref: create-oplog-reader
level: 4
stepnum: 3
content: |
  To perform the migration process, you need a database user with
  permission to read the oplog on your ``admin`` database. Click the
  :guilabel:`Add-ons` link in the left-side navigation. If you don't
  have the :guilabel:`Oplog Access` add-on, add it with the
  :guilabel:`Add` button.

  If you already have the :guilabel:`Oplog Access` add-on, click
  :guilabel:`Configure` to see the oplog user username and password.
  You'll need them both in subsequent migration steps.

  For this step you'll need to have browser tabs open
  with both the Atlas Live Migration process dialog from the previous
  step and your Compose deployment dashboard.

  On your Compose deployment dashboard, click the :guilabel:`Security`
  link in the left-side navigation. The :guilabel:`Whitelist TCP/HTTP
  IPs` section displays a list of IP address ranges which are allowed
  to access your Compose deployment. Add all four of the IP
  address ranges which are listed at the top of the Atlas Migration
  process dialog window.

     Your Atlas migration IP address ranges may be different from
     those shown here.

  certificate. Copy it to the CAFile text box on the Atlas Live
  Migration dialog.
