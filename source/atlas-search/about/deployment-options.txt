You can structure your |service| {+cluster+} with different deployment
types, cloud providers, and cluster tiers to meet the needs of a
pre-production or production environment. Use these recommendations to
select the deployment type, cloud provider and region, and {+cluster+}
and search tiers for performing vector search.

.. _fts-deployment-options-testing:

Testing and Prototyping Environments
------------------------------------

For testing your search queries and prototyping your application, we
recommend the following configuration. This
configuration is best suited for the following use-cases:

- Less than 2M total documents to index.
- Less than 10GB of indexed data. 
- Less than 10,000 queries in a 7-day period.

If your usage exceeds the listed values, migrate to separate search
nodes.

Deployment Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For testing |fts| queries, you can deploy a shared or dedicated
{+cluster+} or a local {+service+} deployments.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+service+} {+Cluster+}
      :tabid: cloud

      {+Cluster+} Tiers 
      `````````````````

      Shared {+clusters+} include the ``M0``, ``M2``, and ``M5`` tiers. These
      low-cost cluster types are available for testing your |fts| queries.
      However, you might experience resource contention and query latency on
      shared {+clusters+}. If you begin your project with a shared
      {+cluster+}, we recommend upgrading to a higher tier when your
      application is ready for production.

      Dedicated {+clusters+} include ``M10`` and higher tiers. The ``M10`` and
      ``M20`` tiers are suitable for prototyping your application. You can
      upgrade to higher tiers to handle large datasets or deploy
      :ref:`dedicated Search Nodes <configure-search-nodes>` for workload
      isolation when your application is ready for production.  

      Cloud Provider and Region 
      `````````````````````````

      All the {+cluster+} tiers are available in all the supported cloud
      provider regions. The cloud provider and region that you choose affects
      the configuration options available for the {+cluster+} tiers and the
      :ref:`cost of running the cluster <atlas-billing>`. 

   .. tab:: Local Deployment
      :tabid: local

      If you prefer to test |fts| queries locally, you can use the 
      {+atlas-cli+} to deploy a single-node replica set hosted on your 
      local computer. To learn more,
      see :atlascli:`Create a Local Atlas Deployment
      </atlas-cli-deploy-local>`. 

      When your application is ready for production, migrate your local |service| 
      deployment to a production environment by using :ref:`Live Migration 
      <c2c-pull-live-migration>`.
      Local deployments are limited by the CPU, memory, and 
      storage resources of your local machine.

Benefits 
````````

.. include:: /includes/search-shared/extracts/fts-coupled-benefits.rst

Limitations 
```````````

You might experience resource contention between the database ``mongod``
and the search ``mongot`` processes. This could negatively impact the
performance of your index and latency of your queries. We recommend this 
deployment model for only testing and prototyping environments. For
production-ready applications and associated search workloads, we
recommend :ref:`migrating to dedicated Search Nodes
<avs-migrate-to-decoupled>`. 

Cost 
````

There are no additional fees or charges when you enable |fts| on your
|service| {+cluster+}. However, you might observe an increase in
resource utilization on the {+cluster+} depending on factors such as 
the size of the indexed collections or index definitions. 

.. _mongot-unavailable:

Considerations
``````````````

Since both the ``mongod`` and ``mongot`` processes run on the same node,
``mongot`` might become unavailable under certain circumstances.   
The following table describes potential causes:

.. _fts-deployment-options-production:

Production Environment
----------------------

For your production-ready application, we recommend the following
{+cluster+} configuration. This configuration in well-suited for the
following use-cases:

- Greater than 2M total documents to index.
- Greater than 10GB of indexed data. 
- Greater than 10,000 queries in a 7-day period.

Deployment Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For production-ready applications, you need a dedicated {+cluster+}. 
 
{+Cluster+} Tiers 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dedicated {+clusters+} include ``M10`` and higher tiers. The ``M10`` and
``M20`` tiers are suitable for development and for production
environments. However, the higher tiers can handle large datasets and
production workloads. We recommend that you also :ref:`deploy dedicated
Search Nodes <configure-search-nodes>` for your search workload. This
allows you to scale your search deployment independently and
appropriately. 

Cloud Provider and Region
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Search Nodes are available in all the regions for |gcp| but
are only available in a subset of |aws| and |azure| :ref:`regions
<fts-cloud-provider-regions>`. You *must* select a cloud provider and
region where Search Nodes are available for your deployment.

All {+cluster+} tiers are available in supported cloud provider regions.
The cloud provider and region that you choose affects the configuration
options and search tiers available for the {+cluster+} and the
:ref:`cost of running the cluster <atlas-billing>`.

.. _fts-search-node-benefits:

Benefits 
````````

Deploying separate Search Nodes provides the following benefits:

High Availability 
  When you deploy separate Search Nodes, |service| enforces a minimum of
  two Search Nodes to ensure your workload remains operational, with
  minimal downtime, in the event of a failure or disruption. 

Scalability 
  When you deploy separate Search Nodes, you can do the following:

  - Scale the storage and compute independent of MongoDB {+cluster+}. 
  - Scale query load independent of MongoDB.

  You can scale Search Nodes both horizontally and vertically. 
  
  You can increase or reduce the number of Search Nodes and horizontally
  scale your {+cluster+}. You can provision between a minimum of 2 to a
  maximum of 32 Search Nodes, both inclusive. |fts| distributes your
  queries for execution on the Search Nodes by cycling through the list
  of available Search Nodes, which allows it to balance the query load
  across all provisioned nodes.  

  You can select different search tiers for your Search Nodes. The
  different search tiers enable you to select the CPU, RAM, storage
  configurations most appropriate for your full-text and vector
  workload.  

Performance 
  When you deploy separate Search Nodes, you improve the performance and
  resource utilization for both the ``mongod`` and ``mongot`` processes
  and eliminate resource contention between the two processes.  
  
  Dedicated Search Nodes support concurrent segment search, which allows
  |fts| to search multiple index segments at the same time and improve
  query response time in some cases. To learn more, see
  :ref:`concurrent-ref`. 

Size and Scale Your {+Cluster+}
```````````````````````````````

To determine the amount of memory that you will need on the Search 
Nodes, use the following |service| metrics:  

- Size of the Search Index
- Total RAM on the Search Node

For example, consider the following: 

- Size of the Search Index = 10GB
- Total RAM on the Search Node = 4GB

Out of the 4GB of RAM, suppose that 1GB is used by other processes and only 3GB is
available for the index data. Therefore, the remaining 7GB of the
index data (10GB - 3GB = 7GB) is paged in, as needed, from the
disk. Frequent paging from disk (7GB) causes increased page faults,
disk I/O, and CPU IOWait, resulting in performance degradation. 

A higher search tier with more RAM (8GB or more) allows for most of
the data for the search index to be served from the memory,
minimizing disk reads and page faults, thereby improving performance. 

.. note:: 

   The local |ssd|\s used for Search Nodes require a 20% 
   storage overhead to support index operations.

.. _fts-migrate-to-decoupled:

Migrate to Dedicated Search Nodes 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With dedicated Search Nodes, you can both size and scale your search
deployment separately from your {+database-deployment+}. It also eliminates
any resource contention that you might experience on a {+cluster+} that
runs both the database and search processes on the same node.

To migrate to dedicated Search Nodes, make the following changes to your
deployment: 

1. If your deployment is currently using a shared tier, :ref:`upgrade
   <change-cluster-type>` your {+cluster+} to a higher tier. Dedicated
   Search Nodes are supported only for ``M10`` and higher {+cluster+}
   tiers. To learn more about migrating to a different {+cluster+} 
   tier, see :ref:`scale-cluster-instance`.

2. Dedicated Search Nodes are available on a subset of the |aws| and |azure|
   regions and in all supported |gcp| regions. Make sure to
   deploy your {+cluster+} in regions where Search Nodes are also
   available. If your existing {+cluster+} is in regions where Search
   Nodes are not available, migrate your {+cluster+} to regions where
   Search Nodes are available. To learn more, see
   :ref:`fts-cloud-provider-regions`.   

3. Enable :guilabel:`Search Nodes for workload isolation` and configure
   Search Nodes. To learn more, see :ref:`add-search-nodes`.

   When you deploy separate Search Nodes, |fts| continues to serve
   queries using the indexes on the |service| {+cluster+} while
   |service| builds the indexes on the Search Nodes. |service| routes
   queries to the Search Nodes only after it completes the following: 
   
   a. Successfully builds all the indexes on the Search Nodes.
   #. Removes the Search Indexes from the {+cluster+} nodes.
