.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: replSetSyncFrom

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   :option host: Specifies the name and port number of the set member
                 that you want *this* member to sync from. Use
                 the ``[hostname]:[port]`` form.

   :dbcommand:`replSetSyncFrom` allows you to explicitly configure
   which host the current :program:`mongod` will poll :term:`oplog`
   entries from. This operation may be useful for testing different
   patterns and in situations where a set member is not syncing from
   the host you want. The member to sync from must be a valid 
   source for data in the set; a member of a replica set cannot sync from:

   - itself.
   - an arbiter, because arbiters do not hold data.
   - a member that does not build indexes.
   - an unreachable member.
   - a :program:`mongod` instance that is not a member of the same
     replica set.

   If you attempt to sync from a member that is more than 10 seconds
   behind the current member, :program:`mongod` will return and log a
   warning, but *will* sync from such members.

   If you attempt to change a member's sync target *during* initial
   sync, the change will not take effect until initial sync completes.
   No error message appears, but the sync target does not change until
   after initial sync.

   The command has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetSyncFrom: "[hostname]:[port]" }

   To run the command in the :program:`mongo` shell, use the following
   invocation:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { replSetSyncFrom: "[hostname]:[port]" } )

   You may also use the :method:`rs.syncFrom()` helper in the
   :program:`mongo` shell, in an operation with the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.syncFrom("[hostname]:[port]")

   .. note::

      :dbcommand:`replSetSyncFrom` provides a temporary override of
      default behavior. When you restart the :program:`mongod`
      instance, if the connection that the :program:`mongod` uses to
      sync, the :program:`mongod` will revert to the default logic for
      selecting a sync source.
