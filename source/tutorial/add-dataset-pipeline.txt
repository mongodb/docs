This page guides you through the steps for creating an {+adl+} pipeline.

.. _adl-add-pipeline-prereqs:

Prerequisites 
------------- 

Before you begin, you must have the following: 

- :ref:`Backup-enabled <backup-cloud-provider>` ``M10`` or higher 
  |service| cluster. 
- :authrole:`Project Owner` role for the project for which you want to 
  deploy a {+dl+}.
- :ref:`Sample data <sample-data>` loaded on your cluster (if you wish 
  to try the example in the following 
  :ref:`adl-add-pipeline-steps`).

.. _adl-add-pipeline-steps:

Procedure 
---------

.. procedure:: 

   .. step:: Navigate to {+adl+} in the |service| UI. 

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/ui-nav-adl.rst 
   
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Add Data Lake Pipeline`.
   
   .. step:: Define the data source for the pipeline.

      You can create a copy of data on your |service| cluster in 
      MongoDB-managed cloud object storage optimized for analytic 
      queries with workload isolation.
      
      To set up a pipeline, specify the following in the 
      :guilabel:`Setup Pipeline` page: 

      a. Select the |service| cluster from the dropdown.

         .. example:: 
            
            If you loaded the sample data on your cluster, select the 
            |service| cluster where you loaded the sample data.

      #. Select the database on the specified cluster from the 
         dropdown.

         .. example:: 
            
            If you selected the cluster where the sample data is 
            loaded, select ``sample_mflix``. 

      #. Select the collection in the specified database from the 
         dropdown.

         .. example:: 
            
            If you selected the ``sample_mflix`` database, select the 
            ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database.

      #. Enter a name for the pipeline.

         .. example:: 
            
            If you are following the examples in this tutorial, enter 
            ``sample_mflix.movies`` in the :guilabel:`Pipeline Name` 
            field.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Continue`.

   .. step:: Specify an extraction schedule for your cluster data.

      You can specify how frequently your cluster data is extracted for 
      querying. Each snapshot represents your data at that point in 
      time, which is stored in a workload isolated, analytic storage. 
      You can query any snapshot data in the {+dl+} datasets.

      You must choose from the following schedules the 
      :guilabel:`Snapshot Schedule` that is similar to your backup 
      schedule:

      - Every day 
      - Every Saturday 
      - Last day of the month

      For example, if you select ``Every day``, you must have a 
      ``Daily`` backup schedule configured in your policy. Or, if you 
      want to select a schedule of once a week, you must have a 
      ``Weekly`` backup schedule configured in your policy. To learn 
      more, see :atlas:`Backup Scheduling </backup/cloud-backup/overview/#backup-scheduling--retention--and-on-demand-backup-snapshots>`.

      .. example:: 
         
         For this tutorial, select :guilabel:`Daily` from the 
         :guilabel:`Snapshot Schedule` dropdown if you don't have a 
         backup schedule yet. If you have a backup schedule, the 
         available options are based on the schedule you have set for 
         your backup schedule.

   .. step:: Specify fields in your collection to create partitions.

      Enter the most commonly queried fields from the collection in the 
      :guilabel:`Partition Attributes` section. To specify nested 
      fields, use the :manual:`dot notation 
      </core/document/#dot-notation>`. Do not include quotes (``""``) 
      around nested fields that you specify using :manual:`dot notation 
      </core/document/#dot-notation>`. You can't specify fields inside 
      an array. The specified fields are used to partition your data. 

      The most frequently queried fields should be listed towards the 
      top because they will have a larger impact on performance and c
      ost than fields listed lower down the list. The order of fields 
      is important in the same way as it is for :manual:`Compound 
      Indexes </core/index-compound/>`. Data is optimized for queries 
      by the first field, followed by the second field, and so on. 

      .. example:: 
         
         Enter ``year`` in the :guilabel:`Most commonly queried field` 
         field and ``title`` in the :guilabel:`Second most commonly 
         queried field` field. 

         {+adl+} optimizes performance for the ``year`` field, followed 
         by the ``title`` field. If you configure a {+fdi+} for your 
         {+dl+} dataset, {+adf+} optimizes performance for queries on 
         the following fields:

         - the ``year`` field,
         - the ``title`` field, and 
         - the ``year`` field and the ``title`` field.

         {+adf+} can also supports a query on the ``title`` field only. 
         However, in this case, {+adf+} wouldn't be as efficient in 
         supporting the query as it would be if the query were on the 
         ``title`` field only. Performance is optimized in order; if a 
         query omits a particular partition, {+adf+} is less efficient 
         in making use of any partitions that follow that.  
  
         You can run {+adf+} queries on fields not specified here, but 
         {+adl+} is less efficient in processing such queries.

   .. step:: (Optional) Specify fields inside your documents to exclude.

      By default, {+adl+} extracts and stores all fields inside the 
      documents in your collection. To specify fields to exclude: 

      a. Click :guilabel:`Add Field`.
      #. Enter field name in the :guilabel:`Add Transformation Field 
         Name` window.

         .. example:: 
            
            (Optional) Enter ``fullplot`` to exclude the field named 
            ``fullplot`` in the ``movies`` collection. 

      #. Click :guilabel:`Done`.
      #. Repeat steps for each field you wish to exclude. To remove a 
         field from this list, click :icon:`trash-alt`.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Finish` to create the {+dl+}.

----------

Now that you've created your {+dl+} pipeline, proceed to 
:ref:`adl-create-federated-db`.
