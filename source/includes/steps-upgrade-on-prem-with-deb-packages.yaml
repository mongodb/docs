  a. Install the ``.deb`` package on each |application| and Backup
     Daemon host. Issue the following command, where  ``<version>`` is
     the version of the ``.deb`` package:

     .. code-block:: sh

        sudo dpkg -i mongodb-mms_<version>_x86_64.deb

  b. When prompted whether to overwrite the currently installed version
     of ``mms.conf``, you should type ``Y`` to replace the existing file.

  c. If you :doc:`modified the ports </tutorial/manage-ports>` or the
     JVM settings that Ops Manager uses, you need to re-apply those
     changes to the ``mms.conf`` file after |onprem| is upgraded.

     .. include:: /includes/admonitions/warning/unredacted-secrets-from-mms-conf.rst

     The upgrade to |onprem| 4.1 and 4.2 removed the ``-d64`` flag from
     the ``JAVA_MMS_UI_OPTS`` parameter.

  d. When upgrading to |onprem| 4.4.11, |onprem| prompts you to choose which version
     of the :file:`/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/conf-mms.properties` file it should use.
     To avoid having to manually reconfigure |onprem|, choose the
     current file. For more information, see :ref:`4.4.11 Release Notes
     <opsmgr-server-4.4.11>`.

  |onprem| remains in **Upgrade Mode** until every host is upgraded. For 
  :doc:`high availability configurations </tutorial/configure-application-high-availability>`, 
  this means:

  - Your hosts might not be fully operational until the upgrade is completed     
    cluster-wide. If your first host upgrade takes longer than expected, continue 
    upgrading the other hosts.

  - Do not stop or cancel processes that seem stuck as this might disrupt the upgrade.

  - The logs that |onprem| generates during startup might temporarily pause 
    at ``Starting pre-flight checks`` while |onprem| upgrades all its servers
    to the same version. 
 
  - For multi-version upgrades, do not skip major versions.
    You must upgrade each node in the cluster to the last minor version of each major release one at a time.
    For example, to upgrade from 6.0.26 to 8.0.3, do the following steps on *each node*:

    1. Stop the service on a node (running 6.0.26).
    2. Upgrade to the most recent minor version of 7.0.x.
    3. Start the upgraded host before you move to the next node.
    4. Repeat for all other nodes.
    5. Repeat this process to upgrade each node from 7.0.x to 8.0.3.
