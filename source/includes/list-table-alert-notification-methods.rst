   * - Email

     - Sends the alert to an email address.

   * - SMS

     - Sends the alert to a mobile number. |service| removes all
       punctuation and letters and uses only the digits. If you are
       outside of the United States or Canada, include ``011`` and the

       uses the U.S.-based `Twilio <https://www.twilio.com>`_ to send
       text messages. As an alternative to your non-U.S. telephone
       number, use a `Google Voice <https://voice.google.com>`__
