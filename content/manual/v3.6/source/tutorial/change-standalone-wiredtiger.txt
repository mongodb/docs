Change Standalone to WiredTiger
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Starting in version 3.2, WiredTiger is the new default storage engine
for MongoDB.

This tutorial gives an overview of changing the storage engine of a
:term:`standalone` MongoDB instance to :ref:`WiredTiger
<storage-wiredtiger>`.

Considerations
--------------

``mongodump`` and ``mongorestore``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: admonition

   This tutorial uses the :binary:`~bin.mongodump` and
   :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` utilities to export and import data.

   - Ensure that these MongoDB package components are installed and
     updated on your system. 

   - Make sure you have sufficient drive space available for the
     :binary:`~bin.mongodump` export file and the data files of your new
     :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance running with WiredTiger.

Default Bind to Localhost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: admonition

   .. include:: /includes/fact-default-bind-ip-change.rst

   The tutorial runs :binary:`~bin.mongodump` and :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`
   from the same host as the :binary:`~bin.mongod` they are connecting to.
   If run remotely, :binary:`~bin.mongodump` and :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`
   must specify the ip address or the associated hostname in order to
   connect to the :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

MongoDB 3.0 or Greater
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-wiredtiger-minimum-version.rst

XFS and WiredTiger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the WiredTiger storage engine, using XFS for data bearing nodes is
recommended on Linux. For more information, see
:ref:`prod-notes-linux-file-system`.
