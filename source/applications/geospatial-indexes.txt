Geospatial Indexes and Queries
==============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB lets you store location data as `GeoJSON
<http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html>`_ objects or as points on a
two-dimensional plane.

MongoDB provides two types of queries for querying the two different types of data.

- 2dsphere, which indexes GeoJSON objects and allows calculations using
  spherical geometry.

- 2d, which indexes points on a two-dimensional plane and allows
  calculations using planar (flat) geometry.

MongoDB provides geospatial query operators that let you query for:

- All points and shapes that exist within a defined area

- All points and shapes that intersect with a defined area

- The nearest points to a defined point

If you query locations on a sphere, then store your location data as
GeoJSON objects and use a 2dsphere index. See
:doc:`/applications/2dsphere-indexes`.

If you query locations using planar geometry, then store your location
data as points and use 2d indexes. See :doc:`/applications/2d-indexes`.
