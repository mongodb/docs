Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: addShardToZone

   Associates a shard with a :term:`zone`. MongoDB associates this shard with
   the given zone. Chunks that are covered by the zone are assigned to shards
   associated with the zone.

   .. |method| replace:: :method:`sh.addShardToZone` helper method
   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand-tip

   .. |command| replace:: ``addShardToZone``

You can only run :dbcommand:`addShardToZone` on the ``admin`` database
from a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-no-serverless.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst


Syntax
------
    
The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand(
      {
        addShardToZone: <string>,
        zone: <string>
      }
   )

Command Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The command takes the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 35 20 80

   * - Field

     - Type

     - Description

   * - :ref:`addShardtoZone <cmd-addShardToZone-shard>`

     - string

     - .. _cmd-addShardToZone-shard:
     
       The name of the shard to associate with the :ref:`zone <cmd-addShardToZone-zone>`.
       
       

   * - :ref:`zone <cmd-addShardToZone-zone>`

     - string

     - .. _cmd-addShardToZone-zone:
     
       The name of the zone to associate with the :ref:`shard
       <cmd-addShardToZone-shard>`.


:binary:`~bin.mongosh` provides the helper method
:method:`sh.addShardToZone()`.

Behavior
--------

You can associate a zone with multiple shards, and a shard can associate with
multiple zones.

See the :ref:`zone <zone-sharding>` manual page for more information on zones
in a sharded cluster.

Ranges
~~~~~~

MongoDB effectively ignores zones that do not have at least one range of
shard key values associated with it. 

To associate a range of shard key values with a zone, use the
:dbcommand:`updateZoneKeyRange` database command, or the
:method:`sh.updateZoneKeyRange()` shell helper.

.. tip::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/zoned-sharding-pre-define-zone.rst

Security
--------

For sharded clusters that enforce :doc:`access control
</tutorial/enable-authentication>`, you must authenticate as a user
whose privileges include either:

- :authaction:`update` on the ``shards`` collection in the ``config``
  database; or, alternatively,

- :authaction:`enableSharding` on the :ref:`cluster
  <resource-specific-collection>` resource.

The :authrole:`clusterAdmin` or :authrole:`clusterManager` built-in roles have
the appropriate permissions for issuing :dbcommand:`addShardToZone`. See the
documentation page for :ref:`Role-Based Access Control <authorization>` for
more information.

Example
-------

The following example associates ``shard0000`` with zone ``JFK``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { addShardToZone : "shard0000" , zone : "JFK" } )


A shard can associate with multiple zones. The following example associates
``LGA`` to ``shard0000``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { addShardToZone : "shard0000" , zone : "LGA" } )

``shard0000`` associates with both the ``LGA`` zone and the ``JFK`` zone. In a
balanced cluster, MongoDB routes reads and writes covered by either zone to
``shard0000``.
