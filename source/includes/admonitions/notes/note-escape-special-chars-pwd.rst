.. note::

        If your passwords, database names, or connection strings contain
        reserved URI characters, you must escape the characters. For example,
        if your password is ``@bc123``, you must escape the ``@``
        character when specifying the password in the connection
        string, such as ``%40bc123``. To learn more, see :ref:`special-pass-characters`.
