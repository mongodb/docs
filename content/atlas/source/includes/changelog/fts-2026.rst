29 January 2026 Release 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adds new |fts| alerts and metrics for index field limits to 
  prevent performance degradation and ``mongot`` instability, which 
  over-indexing can cause:

  - :alert:`Atlas Search: Max Number of Fields Indexed is` 
  
  - :alert:`Atlas Search: Max Number of nGram Fields Indexed is`

  To mitigate alerts, consider switching to static mapping, applying 
  the attribute pattern for polymorphic schemas, and auditing ``nGram`` 
  or ``autocomplete`` usage. To learn more, see 
  :ref:`review-atlas-search-metrics`.
