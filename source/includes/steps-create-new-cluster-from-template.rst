   .. step:: Open the :guilabel:`Create New Cluster` Dialog.

      - If you already have one or more {+database-deployments+}, click
        :guilabel:`Create` to display the 
        :guilabel:`Create New Cluster` dialog box.
      - If this is your first {+database-deployment+}:
        
        a. Click :guilabel:`Build a Database`.
        #. Click :guilabel:`advanced configuration options` at the top of
           the screen to display the
           :guilabel:`Create New Cluster` dialog box.
      
   .. step:: Select a {+cluster+} type.
      
      Select either an ``M10`` {+dedicated-cluster+} or an ``M0`` 
      {+Free-cluster+} type from the available preset templates. You can
      also deploy a {+Serverless-instance+} from this page.
      
      .. include:: /includes/fact-deployment-types.rst
      
      To create a {+Serverless-instance+}, see  
      :doc:`Create a New {+Serverless-Instance+} </tutorial/create-serverless-instance>` 
      for next steps.
      
   .. step:: Select your preferred :guilabel:`Provider`.

      The cloud provider that you select affects the configuration
      options for the available {+cluster+} tiers, network latency for
      clients accessing your {+cluster+}, and the 
      :doc:`cost of running the {+cluster+} </billing>`.
      
      To learn more, see :ref:`create-cluster-cloud-provider-region`.
      
   .. step:: Select your preferred :guilabel:`Region`.

      |service| displays available regions for the cloud provider you
      select. The region that you select determines the geographic location
      of the nodes in your {+cluster+} and the 
      :doc:`cost of running the {+cluster+} </billing>`.
      
      To learn more, see :ref:`create-cluster-cloud-provider-region`.
      
      To deploy your {+cluster+} across multiple regions, you must select
      :guilabel:`advanced configuration options`. Multi-region
      {+clusters+} can better withstand data center outages and may contain
      dedicated geographic regions for localized reads, thereby improving
      performance. To learn how to deploy a multi-region {+cluster+}, see
      :ref:`create-cluster-multi-region`.
      
   .. step:: Specify a name for the {+cluster+} in the :guilabel:`Name` box.
      
      This label identifies the {+cluster+} in |service|.
      
      .. note::
       
         |service| creates your hostname based on your {+cluster+} name.
      
      You can't change the {+cluster+} name after |service| deploys the 
      {+cluster+}. {+Cluster+} names can't exceed 64 characters in length.
      
      .. include:: /includes/admonitions/importants/cluster-naming-limitations.rst
      
   .. step:: Specify a tag key and value to apply to the {+cluster+}.
