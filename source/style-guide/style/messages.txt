If you help write the message text for a product or you suggest edits
to message text, use the guidelines in this topic.

.. note::

   Change message text *only* at the request of (or as a suggestion to)
   the developer. When citing message text in a document, cite the text
   that the user sees in the product.

   * - Guideline
     - Example
     - Comments

   * - Use complete sentences, when possible.
     - *Use:*

       The authentication token isn't valid.

       *Avoid:*

       Invalid authentication token
     - Include articles (*a*, *an*, *the*) to make the sentence
       complete. If possible, use active voice.

       .. note::
          Message text that serves as a heading or label (such as
          ``Elapsed:hh:mm:ss``, which indicates elapsed time) is
          acceptable as a fragment.

   * - Use more than one sentence if required for clarity.
     - You must provide a name for each domain. null isn't a valid
       domain name.
     - Write brief and simple sentences that clearly state the problem.
       Separate the sentences with a period (or question mark, if
       applicable), not with a semicolon.

   * - Avoid using only uppercase letters.
     - *Use:*

       The requested image $UUID has automatic disk resizing disabled.

       *Avoid:*

       THE REQUESTED IMAGE $UUID HAS AUTOMATIC DISK RESIZING DISABLED.
     - Lines with excessive capitalization are hard to read. Use all
       uppercase letters only for words that require it, such as a
       keyword, a data type, or a specific table name that's displayed
       in all uppercase letters to a database user.

   * - When possible, include a recommendation, either a potential fix
       or a reference to a document for more information.
     - The system is out of virtual IP addresses. Contact Support so
       they can allocate more virtual IP addresses.

       The value -1.0 can't be accepted. Specify a positive integer
       value for the volume size.
     - Messages should provide specific information about how the user
       should continue.

   * - Be specific.
     - *Use:*

       The live migration of instance 89a5e582-d3f3-4665-ate2-03c2114f0bib to
       host compute2 failed.

       *Avoid:*

       Live migration failed.
     - Messages should provide as much detailed information as
       possible.

   * - Use *n* to represent an unspecified or generic number. Use *x*
       to represent an unknown version number.
     - The rate limit has been reached (*n* requests in 24 hours).
       Please try again later.

       This option is available only for Ubuntu 12.\ *x*.
     - None

   * - Avoid blaming the user.
     - *Use:*

       The request couldn't be understood by the server because of
       malformed syntax.

       *Avoid:*

       You entered bad request syntax.
     - Rewrite messages that imply fault on the part of the user. Use
       passive voice when necessary.

   * - When possible, use positive statements.
     - *Use:*

       The given limit must be positive and must be less than 50.

       *Avoid:*

       The given limit can't be negative and can't be greater than 50.
     - Positive statements are easier to understand than negative
       statements.
