.. expression:: $week

   Takes a date and returns the week of the year as a number
   between 0 and 53.

   Weeks begin on Sundays, and week 1 begins with the first Sunday
   of the year. Days preceding the first Sunday of the year are in
   week 0. This behavior is the same as the "``%U``" operator to the
   ``strftime`` standard library function.
