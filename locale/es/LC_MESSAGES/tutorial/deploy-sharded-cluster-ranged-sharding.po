"In ranged-based sharding, MongoDB automatically divides data into "
"contiguous ranges determined by the shard key values. In this model, "
"documents with \"close\" shard key values are likely to be in the same "
":term:`chunk` or :term:`shard`. This allows for efficient queries where "
"reads target documents within a contiguous range. However, both read and "
"write performance may decrease with poor shard key selection. See :ref"
