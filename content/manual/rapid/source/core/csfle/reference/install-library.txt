MongoDB uses the {+shared-library+} (recommended) or the ``mongocryptd`` executable
process to translate queries into encrypted queries, and to encrypt or decrypt data.

Before You Begin
----------------

To use CSFLE with automatic encryption, you must first choose
the query analysis component you want MongoDB to use to encrypt the fields.

- :ref:`crypt_shared <csfle-reference-install-shared-lib>`, the
  recommended CSFLE library. 
- :ref:`mongocryptd
  <csfle-reference-install-mongocryptd>`, which is included
  in MongoDB Enterprise Server installations.

The ``libmongocrypt`` library and MongoDB drivers require the 
{+shared-library+} or ``mongocryptd`` to interpret encrypted queries. For more
information, see :ref:`csfle-reference-libmongocrypt`.

.. _csfle-reference-install-shared-lib:

{+shared-library+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+shared-library+} is a **dynamic library** that enables
your client application to perform automatic encryption. A
dynamic library is a set of functionality accessed by an
application at runtime rather than compile time. The
{+shared-library+} performs the following tasks:

- Reads the encryption schema to determine which fields to
  encrypt or decrypt 
- Prevents your application from executing unsupported
  operations on encrypted fields

The {+shared-library+} *does not* do any of the following:

- Perform data encryption or decryption
- Access the encryption key material
- Listen for data over the network

The {+shared-library+} is a preferred alternative to ``mongocryptd`` and does
not require you to spawn another process to perform automatic encryption.

.. note::

   While we recommend using the {+shared-library+}, ``mongocryptd`` is still supported.

To learn more about automatic encryption, see
:ref:`<csfle-features>`.

.. _csfle-reference-install-mongocryptd:

mongocryptd
~~~~~~~~~~~

``mongocryptd`` is installed with `MongoDB Enterprise
Server <{+enterprise-download-link+}>`__.

When you create a CSFLE-enabled MongoDB client, the ``mongocryptd``
process starts automatically by default.

.. include:: /includes/queryable-encryption/qe-facts-mongocryptd-process.rst

The official MongoDB drivers require access to the
``mongocryptd`` process on the client host machine. These
clients search for the ``mongocryptd`` process in the system
``PATH`` by default.

Steps
-----

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+shared-library+}
      :tabid: shared-library

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Download the {+shared-library+}

            Download the {+shared-library+} from the `MongoDB Download Center
            <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/enterprise>`__ by selecting the
            version and platform, then the library:

            #. In the :guilabel:`Version` dropdown, select the version labeled as "current."
            #. In the :guilabel:`Platform` dropdown, select your platform.
            #. In the :guilabel:`Package` dropdown, select ``crypt_shared``.
            #. Click :guilabel:`Download`.

            .. tip::

               To view an expanded list of available releases and packages, see
               `MongoDB Enterprise Downloads
               <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/enterprise/releases>`__.


         .. step:: Configure {+shared-library+}

            You can configure how your driver searches for the {+shared-library+}
            through the following parameters:

            .. list-table::
               :header-rows: 1
               :stub-columns: 1
               :widths: 30 70

               * - Name
                 - Description

               * - ``cryptSharedLibPath``
                 -  Specifies the absolute path to the {+shared-library+} package,
                    {+shared-library-package+}.

                    **Default**: ``undefined``

               * - ``cryptSharedLibRequired``
                 - Specifies if the driver must use the {+shared-library+}. If
                   ``true``, the driver raises an error if the {+shared-library+}
                   is unavailable. If ``false``, the driver performs the following
                   sequence of actions:
        
                   #. Attempts to use the {+shared-library+}.
                   #. If the {+shared-library+} is unavailable, the driver attempts to
                      spawn and connect to ``mongocryptd``.

                   **Default**: ``false``

            To view an example demonstrating how to configure these parameters,
            see the :ref:`Quick Start <csfle-quick-start>`.
