Quick Start with Electron
=========================

Overview
--------


This page contains information to integrate Realm into your
Electron application quickly. To learn how to set up an Electron
application with Realm without using any additional frameworks, see the
:ref:`Electron set up <electron-setup>` instructions. If you have
already created an application using `Create React App
<https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html>`_ or are
interested in integrating a React App with Realm using Electron, check
out the :ref:`Electron with React set up <node-electron-cra-client-quick-start>`
instructions.

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- :ref:`Created an App <create-a-realm-app>`
- :ref:`Enabled Device Sync <enable-sync>`

.. note:: Version Requirement

   Realm works with any of the officially supported Electron
   versions. We recommend using the latest stable release. To see the
   officially supported Electron versions, check out the `Electron
   Releases <https://www.electronjs.org/releases/>`_ document.

Setup
-----

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Set up Your Application Files

      To begin developing your application, create an application directory:

      .. code-block:: shell

         mkdir myElectronApplication

      Create an ``index.html``, ``main.js``, and ``renderer.js`` file in the root
      directory of your application.

      .. code-block:: sh

         touch index.html main.js renderer.js

      The ``main.js`` file is the entry point into your application and
      executes on the main process. It is responsible for loading your ``index.html``
      file into Electron's `BrowserWindow API
      <https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window>`__. Any script files that
      you require in this HTML file will execute on a renderer process.
      Add the following to your ``index.html`` file:

      .. code-block:: html

         <!DOCTYPE html>
         <html>
           <head>
             <meta charset="UTF-8" />
             <title>Hello World!</title>
           </head>
           <body>
             <h1>Hello World!</h1>
             <script src="renderer.js"></script>
           </body>
         </html>

      Add the following code to the ``renderer.js`` file:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         const Realm = require("realm");

      .. note::

         Each Electron application can only have one ``main process``. The
         main process creates web pages. Each web page runs in its
         own process, known as a ``renderer process``. To learn more about
         this, read the official `Electron Process Model
         <https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/process-model>`__
         document.


   .. step:: Create the Main Script File

      The ``main.js`` file is the entry point of your application. Create an
      Electron BrowserWindow in it and load your ``index.html`` file to display your
      HTML to users:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

         function createWindow () {
           const win = new BrowserWindow({
             width: 800,
             height: 600,
             webPreferences: {
               nodeIntegration: true,
               contextIsolation: false
             }
           })

           // to prevent the Sync Connection from ending prematurely, start reading from stdin so we don't exit
           process.stdin.resume();

           win.loadFile('index.html')
         }

         app.whenReady().then(createWindow)


   .. step:: Set up a ``package.json``

      Initialize a ``package.json`` to begin installing packages and using them
      in your project. Run the following command in your terminal:

      .. code-block:: shell

         npm init -y

      Your application file structure should resemble the following:

      .. code-block:: text
         :emphasize-lines: 5, 6

         .
         |-- package.json
         |-- package-lock.lock
         |-- index.html
         |-- main.js // runs on the main process
         |-- renderer.js // runs on a renderer process

      The file ``main.js`` executes on the ``main`` process. The file
      ``renderer.js`` and any other files required by it, or by ``index.html``,
      executes on a ``renderer`` process.


   .. step:: Install Your Project Dependencies

      Install the necessary dependencies to begin developing your Electron application using Realm.

      .. code-block:: shell

         npm install electron --save-dev
         npm install realm@12 --save


   .. step:: Create a Script to Run Your Application

      Add a script to your ``package.json`` file in order to start your application with the ``npm start`` command.

      .. code-block:: json

         "scripts": {
          "start": "electron ."
         }


   .. step:: Run Your Application

      Start your application from the terminal:

      .. code-block:: shell

         npm start

      You should see the following:

      .. cssclass:: bordered-figure
      .. figure:: /images/electron-app.png
        :alt: Electron Desktop App

Open a Realm
------------

Authenticate a user, define a schema, and :ref:`sync enabled Device Sync
<enable-sync>`, then call :js-sdk:`Realm.open() <classes/Realm-1.html#open>` 
in your renderer.js file.

Once you have opened the realm, you can :ref:`write to the realm
<node-realm-database-writes>`.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 17

   const app = new Realm.App({ id: "<Your App ID>" }); // create a new instance of the Realm.App
   async function run() {

     // login with an anonymous credential
     await app.logIn(Realm.Credentials.anonymous());

     const DogSchema = {
         name: "Dog",
         properties: {
           _id: 'int',
           name: "string",
           age: "int",
         },
         primaryKey: '_id'
     };

     const realm = await Realm.open({
       schema: [DogSchema],
       sync: {
         user: app.currentUser,
         partitionValue: "myPartition",
       },
     });
     
     // The myPartition realm is now synced to the device. You can
     // access it through the `realm` object returned by `Realm.open()`

     // write to the realm
   }
   run().catch(err => {
     console.error("Failed to open realm:", err)
   });
