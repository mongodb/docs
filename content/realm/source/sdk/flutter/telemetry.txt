Apple Privacy Manifest
----------------------

The Atlas Device SDK for Flutter does *not* include analytics in builds for the
App Store. Because we do not collect telemetry on those builds, the SDK's Apple
privacy manifest does not mention this telemetry. The SDK's Apple privacy
manifest only covers Apple's API disclosure requirements.

For more details, refer to :ref:`ios-apple-privacy-manifest`.
