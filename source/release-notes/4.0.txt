Remove Support for ``MONGODB-CR``
---------------------------------

Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB removes support for the deprecated
MongoDB Challenge-Response (``MONGODB-CR``) authentication mechanism.

Since version 3.0, MongoDB has not supported the creation of
``MONGODB-CR`` users unless the deployment had been upgraded from a 2.6
or earlier deployment that already had ``MONGODB-CR`` users and had not
upgraded the authentication schema.

If your deployment has user credentials stored in ``MONGODB-CR``
schema, you must upgrade to :ref:`Salted Challenge Response
Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) <authentication-scram>` **before** you
upgrade to version 4.0. For information on upgrading to ``SCRAM``, see
:doc:`/release-notes/3.0-scram`.

.. _4.0-deprecate-mmapv1:

Deprecate MMAPv1
----------------

Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB deprecates the :ref:`storage-mmapv1`
and will remove MMAPv1 in a future release.

To change your MMAPv1 storage engine deployment to
:doc:`/core/wiredtiger`, see:

- :doc:`/tutorial/change-standalone-wiredtiger`

- :doc:`/tutorial/change-replica-set-wiredtiger`

- :doc:`/tutorial/change-sharded-cluster-wiredtiger`

.. _4.0-remove-master-slave:

Remove Master-Slave Replication
-------------------------------

MongoDB 4.0 removes support for the deprecated master-slave
replication. Before you can upgrade to MongoDB 4.0, if your deployment
uses master-slave replication, you must upgrade to a replica set.

To convert your master-slave replication, see
:ref:`convert-master-slave-to-replica-set`.

Platform Support
----------------

- MongoDB 4.0 does not support SLES 11. Support for SLES 11 has also
  been removed in MongoDB 3.2.20+, 3.4.15+, and 3.6.4+.

- MongoDB 4.0 does not support Ubuntu 12.04. Support for Ubuntu
  12.04 has also been removed in MongoDB 3.2.20+, 3.4.15+, and 3.6.4+.

General Improvements
--------------------

- The geospatial query operators :query:`$near` and
  :query:`$nearSphere` now supports querying on sharded collections.

Changes Affecting Compatibility
-------------------------------

Some changes can affect compatibility and may require user actions. For
a detailed list of compatibility changes, see
:doc:`/release-notes/4.0-compatibility`.
