.. [#data-bearing]

   For replica sets, the data-bearing servers are the servers hosting 
   the replica set nodes. For sharded clusters, the data-bearing 
   servers are the servers hosting the shards. For sharded clusters, 
   |cloudgov-short| also deploys servers for the 
   :ref:`config servers <sharding-config-server>`; these are charged at 
   a rate separate from the cluster costs.
