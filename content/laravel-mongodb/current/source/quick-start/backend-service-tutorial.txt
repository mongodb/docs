Overview
--------

In this tutorial, you create a simple REST back end for a front-end app
by using {+odm-long+}. The tutorial uses Laravel's built-in API routing
features.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can start this tutorial, you need the following software
installed in your development environment:

- MongoDB Atlas cluster with sample data loaded. To learn how to create
  a cluster, see the :ref:`laravel-quick-start-create-deployment` step
  of the Quick Start guide.
- `PHP <https://www.php.net/downloads>`__.
- `Composer <https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md>`__.
- `{+php-extension+} <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/php-library/current/get-started/#download-and-install>`__.
- A terminal app and shell. For MacOS users, use Terminal or a similar app.
  For Windows users, use PowerShell.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create a Laravel project.

      First, create a Laravel project directory. Then, run the following
      command to create a new Laravel project called ``laraproject``:
      
      .. code-block:: bash

         composer create-project laravel/laravel laraproject

   .. step:: Install {+odm-long+}.

      To check that {+odm-long+} is running in the web server,
      add a webpage to your Laravel website. In your project,
      navigate to ``/routes/web.php`` and add the following route:

      .. code-block:: php

         Route::get('/info', function () {
             phpinfo();
         });

      Then, run the following command in your shell to start
      your application:

      .. code-block:: bash

         php artisan serve

      After the application begins running, navigate to
      http://127.0.0.1:8000/info to view the PHPinfo page. Scroll down
      to or search for the **mongodb** entry to verify that
      the {+php-extension+} is installed.

      Run the following command in your shell to install {+odm-long+}:

      .. code-block:: bash

         composer require mongodb/laravel-mongodb:^{+package-version+}

   .. step:: Configure your MongoDB connection.

      Open your project's ``config/database.php`` file and update the
      ``connections`` array as shown in the following code:

      .. code-block:: php

         'connections' => [
                 'mongodb' => [
                     'driver' => 'mongodb',
                     'dsn' => '<connection string>',
                     'database' => 'db',
                 ],
      
      Ensure that you replace the connection string placeholder
      in the preceding code with your connection string before you run
      your application. To learn how to locate your connection string, see
      :ref:`laravel-quick-start-connection-string` in the Quick Start
      guide.

      You can also set the default database connection. At the top of
      the ``config/database.php`` file, change 'default' to the following:

      .. code-block:: php

         'default' => 'mongodb',

      The Laravel application can now connect to the ``db`` database in
      your MongoDB cluster.

   .. step:: Create an endpoint to ping your deployment.

      Run the following shell command to set up API routing:

      .. code-block:: bash

         php artisan install:api

      In the newly created ``routes/api.php`` file, add the following
      route:

      .. code-block:: php
         
         // Add the DB use statement to the top of the file.
         use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
         
         Route::get('/ping', function (Request $request) {
             $connection = DB::connection('mongodb');
             $msg = 'MongoDB is accessible!';
             try {
                 $connection->command(['ping' => 1]);
             } catch (\Exception $e) {
                 $msg = 'MongoDB is not accessible. Error: ' . $e->getMessage();
             }
             return ['msg' => $msg];
         });

      Reload the application, then verify that
      http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/ping shows the succesful ping message.

   .. step:: Create Eloquent models.
      
      Laravel is integrated with Eloquent, an ORM that abstracts the
      database back end so that you can connect to different databases by
      using a common interface.

      Eloquent provides a ``Model`` class to serve as the interface
      between your code and a specific collection. Instances of the
      ``Model`` classes represent rows of tables in relational
      databases. In MongoDB, they are documents in the collection.

      .. tip::

         You can define fillable fields in your Eloquent models
         to enforce a document schema in your application and prevent
         errors such as name typos. To learn more, see the
         :ref:`laravel-model-mass-assignment` section of the Eloquent
         Model Class guide.

      Create an Eloquent model called ``CustomerMongoDB`` by running
      the following command from the project root:

      .. code-block:: bash
         
         php artisan make:model CustomerMongoDB

      Laravel creates the ``CustomerMongoDB`` class in the ``/models``
      directory. By default, models use the ``default`` database
      connection, but you can specify which connection to use by adding
      the ``$connection`` member to the class. You can also
      specify the collection name by adding the ``$collection`` member.

      Ensure you include the ``use`` statement for the MongoDB Eloquent
      model. This is necessary to set ``_id`` as the primary key.

      Replace the contents of the ``CustomerMongoDB.php`` file with the
      following code:

      .. code-block:: php
         
         use MongoDB\Laravel\Eloquent\Model;
         
         class CustomerMongoDB extends Model
         {
             // the selected database as defined in /config/database.php
             protected $connection = 'mongodb';
         
             // equivalent to $table for MySQL
             protected $collection = 'laracoll';
         
             // defines the schema for top-level properties (optional).
             protected $fillable = ['guid', 'first_name', 'family_name', 'email', 'address'];
         }

   .. step:: Perform CRUD operations.

      After you create your models, you can perform data operations.
   
      Create the following route in your ``api.php`` file:

      .. code-block:: php

         Route::get('/create_eloquent_mongo/', function (Request $request) {
             $success = CustomerMongoDB::create([
                 'guid'=> 'cust_1111',
                 'first_name'=> 'John',
                 'family_name' => 'Doe',
                 'email' => 'j.doe@gmail.com',
                 'address' => '123 my street, my city, zip, state, country'
             ]);
         });

      After you insert the document, you can retrieve it by using the
      ``where()`` method as shown in the following code:

      .. code-block:: php

         Route::get('/find_eloquent/', function (Request $request) {
             $customer = CustomerMongoDB::where('guid', 'cust_1111')->get();
         });

      Eloquent allows you to find data by using complex queries with
      multiple matching conditions.

      You can also update and delete data shown in the following routes:

      .. code-block:: php

         Route::get('/update_eloquent/', function (Request $request) {
             $result = CustomerMongoDB::where('guid', 'cust_1111')->update( ['first_name' => 'Jimmy'] );
         });

         Route::get('/delete_eloquent/', function (Request $request) {
             $result = CustomerMongoDB::where('guid', 'cust_1111')->delete();
         });

      At this point, your MongoDB-connected back-end service is
      running, but MongoDB provides more functionality to support your
      operations.

   .. step:: Perform operations on nested data.

      {+odm-long+} offers MongoDB-specific operations for nested data.
      However, adding nested data is also intuitive without using
      the ``embedsMany()`` and ``embedsOne()`` methods.

      As shown in the preceding step, you can define top-level schema
      attributes. However, it is more complicated when to define these
      attribute if your documents include arrays and embedded documents.

      You can create the model's data structures in PHP. In the
      following example, the ``address`` field is an object type.
      The ``email`` field is an array of strings:

      .. code-block:: php

         Route::get('/create_nested/', function (Request $request) {
             $message = "executed";
             $success = null;

             $address = new stdClass;
             $address->street = '123 my street name';
             $address->city = 'my city';
             $address->zip= '12345';
             $emails = ['j.doe@gmail.com', 'j.doe@work.com'];

             try {
                 $customer = new CustomerMongoDB();
                 $customer->guid = 'cust_2222';
                 $customer->first_name = 'John';
                 $customer->family_name= 'Doe';
                 $customer->email= $emails;
                 $customer->address= $address;
                 $success = $customer->save(); // save() returns 1 or 0
             }
             catch (\Exception $e) {
                 $message = $e->getMessage();
             }
             return ['msg' => $message, 'data' => $success];
         });

      When you access the ``/api/create_nested/`` endpoint, it creates a
      document in MongoDB:

      .. code-block:: json

         {
           "_id": {...},
           "guid": "cust_2222",
           "first_name": "John",
           "family_name": "Doe",
           "email": [
             "j.doe@gmail.com",
             "j.doe@work.com"
           ],
           "address": {
             "street": "123 my street name",
             "city": "my city",
             "zip": "12345"
           },
           "updated_at": {
             "$date": "2025-05-27T17:38:28.793Z"
           },
           "created_at": {
             "$date": "2025-05-27T17:38:28.793Z"
           }
         }

   .. step:: Use the MongoDB Query API.

      MongoDB provides the Query API for optimized queries.

      You can begin to build a query by using a ``collection`` object.
      Eloquent exposes the full capabilities of the underlying database
      by using "raw queries," which Laravel sends to the database
      without any processing from the Eloquent Query Builder.

      You can perform a raw native MongoDB query from the model as shown
      in the following code:

      .. code-block:: php

         $mongodbquery = ['guid' => 'cust_1111'];
   
         // returns a "Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection" Object
         $results = CustomerMongoDB::whereRaw( $mongodbquery )->get();

      You can also access the native MongoDB collection object and
      perform a query that returns objects such as native MongoDB
      documents or cursors:

      .. code-block:: php

         $mongodbquery = ['guid' => 'cust_1111', ];
         $mongodb_native_collection = DB::connection('mongodb')->getCollection('laracoll');
         $document = $mongodb_native_collection->findOne( $mongodbquery );
         $cursor = $mongodb_native_collection->find( $mongodbquery );

      The following code demonstrates multiple ways to perform queries:

      .. code-block:: php

         Route::get('/find_native/', function (Request $request) {
             // a simple MongoDB query that looks for a customer based on the guid
             $mongodbquery = ['guid' => 'cust_2222'];

             // Option #1
             // =========
             // use Eloquent's whereRaw() function
             // returns a "Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection" Object

             $results = CustomerMongoDB::whereRaw( $mongodbquery )->get();

             // Option #2 & #3
             // ==============
             // use the native MongoDB driver Collection object and the Query API

             $mdb_collection = DB::connection('mongodb')->getCollection('laracoll');

             // find the first document that matches the query
             $mdb_bsondoc = $mdb_collection->findOne( $mongodbquery ); // returns a "MongoDB\Model\BSONDocument" Object

             // to convert the MongoDB Document to a Laravel Model, use the Model's newFromBuilder() method
             $cust = new CustomerMongoDB();
             $one_doc = $cust->newFromBuilder((array) $mdb_bsondoc);

             // find all documents because you pass an empty query
             $mdb_cursor = $mdb_collection->find(); // returns a "MongoDB\Driver\Cursor" object
             $cust_array = array();
             foreach ($mdb_cursor->toArray() as $bson) {
                 $cust_array[] = $cust->newFromBuilder( $bson );
             }

             return ['msg' => 'executed', 'whereraw' => $results, 'document' => $one_doc, 'cursor_array' => $cust_array];
         });

      The following code demonstrates how to use the ``updateOne()``
      method to update documents:

      .. code-block:: php

         Route::get('/update_native/', function (Request $request) {
             $mdb_collection = DB::connection('mongodb')->getCollection('laracoll');
             $match = ['guid' => 'cust_2222'];
             $update = ['$set' => ['first_name' => 'Henry', 'address.street' => '777 new street name'] ];
             $result = $mdb_collection->updateOne($match, $update );
             return ['msg' => 'executed', 'matched_docs' => $result->getMatchedCount(), 'modified_docs' => $result->getModifiedCount()];
         });

      The following code demonstrates how to use the ``deleteOne()``
      method to delete documents:

      .. code-block:: php

         Route::get('/delete_native/', function (Request $request) {
             $mdb_collection = DB::connection('mongodb')->getCollection('laracoll');
             $match = ['guid' => 'cust_2222'];
             $result = $mdb_collection->deleteOne($match );
             return ['msg' => 'executed', 'deleted_docs' =>
             $result->getDeletedCount() ];
         });

      To learn more about how to perform CRUD operations, see the
      :ref:`laravel-fundamentals-write-ops` and
      :ref:`laravel-fundamentals-read-ops` guides.

   .. step:: Use the aggregation framework.

      An aggregation pipeline is a task in MongoDB's aggregation
      framework. You can use the aggregation framework to perform
      various tasks such as real-time dashboards and big data analysis.

      An aggregation pipeline consists of multiple stages in which the
      output of each stage is the input of the following stage.
      This step uses the ``sample_mflix`` from the :atlas:`Atlas sample
      datasets </sample-data/>`. Laravel allows you to access multiple
      MongoDB databases in the same app, so add the ``sample_mflix``
      database connection to ``database.php``:

      .. code-block:: php

         'mongodb_mflix' => [
                     'driver' => 'mongodb',
                     'dsn' => env('DB_URI'),
                     'database' => 'sample_mflix',
                 ],

      Next, create the ``/aggregate/`` API endpoint and define an
      aggregation pipeline to retrieve data from the ``movies``
      collection, compute the average movie rating for each genre, and
      return a list.

      .. code-block:: php

         Route::get('/aggregate/', function (Request $request) {
             $mdb_collection = DB::connection('mongodb_mflix')->getCollection('movies');
         
             $stage0 = ['$unwind' => ['path' => '$genres']];
             $stage1 = ['$group' => ['_id' => '$genres', 'averageGenreRating' => ['$avg' => '$imdb.rating']]];
             $stage2 = ['$sort' => ['averageGenreRating' => -1]];
             $aggregation = [$stage0, $stage1, $stage2];
         
             $mdb_cursor = $mdb_collection->aggregate( $aggregation );
         
             return ['msg' => 'executed', 'data' => $mdb_cursor->toArray() ];
         });

      {+odm-long+} provides the :ref:`laravel-aggregation-builder` to
      build type-safe aggregation pipelines directly from your models.
      We recommend using the aggregation builder to perform
      aggregations.

   .. step:: Use indexes to optimize query performance.

      You can create indexes to support your queries and improve
      performance. To learn more about how to create indexes
      programmatically, see the :ref:`laravel-eloquent-indexes` section
      of the Schema Builder guide.
