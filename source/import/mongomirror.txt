|mongomirror| is a tool for manually migrating data from an existing
MongoDB replica set to a MongoDB |service| replica set.
See :ref:`Download mongomirror <download-mongomirror>`.

|mongomirror| doesn't require you to shut down your existing replica set
or applications, doesn't import user or role data, and doesn't copy the
``config`` database.

.. include:: /includes/mongomirror-support.rst

Prerequisites
-------------

Source MongoDB Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The source MongoDB deployment must be a replica set. If the source is a
  standalone MongoDB deployment, before running |mongomirror|,
  :manual:`convert the standalone to a replica set </tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set/>`.

- The source replica set must run MongoDB version 2.6 or higher.

- The source MongoDB replica set can't be an ``M0`` {+Free-cluster+} or ``M2/M5`` shared cluster (deprecated).

- The source MongoDB replica set can't contain data in :manual:`time series collections </core/timeseries-collections/>`.

- Don't change the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` flag at any time during the procedure.

- .. include:: /includes/fact-migrate-drop-geoHaystack.rst

- .. include:: /includes/fact-mongomirror-ttl-indexes.rst

- .. include:: /includes/fact-mongomirror-namespace-changes.rst

- You can't use the 
  :dbcommand:`renameCollection <dbcmd.renameCollection>` command or the
  :pipeline:`$out <pipe.$out>` aggregation stage as part of initial sync,
  which runs as a part of the |mongomirror| process.

- Don't restart the primary during the initial sync stage of the migration.

.. _source-rs-authorization:

Required Access on Source Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mongomirror| must have network access to the source replica set. If the
source replica set requires authentication, include user credentials
when running |mongomirror|. Specify a database user with, at a
minimum, the following privileges:

- Read all databases and collections. The :authrole:`readAnyDatabase`
  role on the ``admin`` database covers this requirement.

- Read the :term:`oplog`. See :ref:`ref-atlas-oplog`.

- Run the :dbcommand:`getParameter` command.

If no such user exists, create the user in your source MongoDB replica set.
Different MongoDB Server versions have different built-in roles. Select a
built-in role based on your MongoDB Server version and run the appropriate
commands in the {+mongosh+}:

.. include:: /includes/mongomirror-required-roles-full-list.rst

Destination |service| Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The destination |service| deployment:

- Can't be an ``M0`` {+Free-cluster+}, ``M2``, or ``M5`` {+Shared-cluster+} (deprecated).

- Can't be a {+Serverless-instance+} (deprecated).

- Must be a replica set.

- Must have the version that is the same as or later than the source {+cluster+}
  MongoDB version. See :ref:`mongomirror-import-upgrade-path`.
  
- Must not contain any namespaces that overlap with the source {+cluster+}.
  If |mongomirror| detects overlapping namespaces on the destination {+cluster+}
  it fails before starting the process. If your destination {+cluster+} contains
  overlapping namespaces, delete all data from the destination {+cluster+} with
  :option:`--drop`, or list the namespaces to import from the source
  {+cluster+} with :option:`--includeNamespace`.

- Must include in its IP access list either:

  - The public IP address of the server on which |mongomirror| is running, or

  - If set up for VPC peering, either the peer's VPC CIDR block (or a subset)
    or the Security Group of the peer VPC.

  .. note::

     To find the public IP address for any node in your {+cluster+}, 
     use the ``nslookup`` tool from the command line. To learn more, 
     see :ref:`faq-public-ip-changes`.

.. _destination-authorization:

Required Access on the Destination Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mongomirror| must have network access to the destination {+cluster+}.

You must specify a database user with the :atlasrole:`Atlas admin`
role to run |mongomirror|. To learn more, see :ref:`add-mongodb-users`.

.. _mongomirror-import-upgrade-path:

Upgrade Path
------------

.. important::

   |mongomirror| is not supported for migrations between MongoDB 6.0+ source
   {+clusters+} and 6.0+ destination {+clusters+}.
   You can't use |mongomirror| to migrate from a source replica set 6.0.x
   or later to a destination replica set 6.0.x or later.

   You can use |mongomirror| to migrate from a source replica set on previous
   versions to a destination replica set with MongoDB version 6.0.

   Alternatively, you can :manual:`upgrade </release-notes/6.0-upgrade-replica-set/>`
   your source replica set to {+c2c-version+}+ or {+c2c-version-7+}+ and use
   :ref:`this live migration procedure <c2c-pull-live-migration>` to migrate
   an upgraded replica set to |service|.

|mongomirror| supports the following migration paths.

.. _download-mongomirror:

Download ``mongomirror``
------------------------

.. note::

   On macOS 64-bit, a security alert appears when you first try to open
   the ``mongomirror`` file after you have downloaded it. To proceed, see
   `Open an app by overriding security settings
   <https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-an-app-by-overriding-security-settings-mh40617/12.0/mac/12.0>`__.

``mongomirror`` Process
-----------------------

When you start |mongomirror|, it:

#. Connects to |service| over |tls-ssl|.

#. Performs an initial sync, copying collections from the existing MongoDB
   replica set to the destination {+cluster+} in |service|.

#. After the initial sync, continuously tails the replica set's oplog
   for incoming changes and replays them on the destination {+cluster+} in |service|.
   |mongomirror| doesn't copy the ``config`` database. |mongomirror| uses wire
   compression if you enable it on either the source or the destination
   {+cluster+} and use :option:`--compressors` to specify which compression
   libraries to allow.

   |mongomirror| builds all indexes on the destination {+cluster+} in
   the foreground, regardless of how the indexes were built on the source
   {+cluster+}. Foreground index builds block all other operations on the
   database. To learn more, see
   :manual:`Index Build Operations on a Populated Collection </core/index-creation>`.

Once started, |mongomirror| runs continuously until you shut it down:

- If you shut down |mongomirror| during the initial sync stage,
  before you restart |mongomirror|, check that the destination {+cluster+}
  is empty, or run |mongomirror| with :option:`--drop`.

- If you shut down |mongomirror| during the :term:`oplog` tailing
  stage, the process stops tailing the :term:`oplog`. You can
  restart |mongomirror| to continue tailing from the last processed
  oplog record using :option:`--bookmarkFile`.

.. _mongomirror-migration-procedure:

Run ``mongomirror``
-------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps-migrate-using-mongomirror-run.rst

To complete the migration process, :ref:`verify data transfer and switch to Atlas <mongomirror-migrate-to-atlas>`.

.. _mongomirror-migrate-to-atlas:

Switch to |service|
-------------------

After |mongomirror| completes the initial sync and tails the replica set's
oplog, you can switch over to the destination |service| {+cluster+}.

.. include:: /includes/steps/migrate-using-mongomirror-switch.rst

Monitoring
----------

|mongomirror| logs its progress to the standard output in the terminal.
During the initial sync, |mongomirror| logs a progress bar for each
collection it copies. For example:

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: false

   2024-08-09T16:35:50.227-0000  [#....................]  park.events  2179/34184    (6.4%)
   2024-08-09T16:35:50.227-0000  [#############........]  zoo.animals  29000/49778  (58.3%)

When tailing the oplog, |mongomirror| logs the lag time, in seconds,
between the most recent oplog entry on the source {+cluster+} and the last
processed oplog entry on the destination {+cluster+}. For example:

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: false

   2024-12-12T16:22:17.027-0800 Current lag from source: 6s

A lag time of 6 seconds means that the last oplog entry
|mongomirror| processed occurred 6 seconds before the most
recent one available on the source {+cluster+}.

.. note::

   The amount of time it takes |mongomirror| to catch up may be
   greater or less than 6 seconds, depending on the number of entries
   that arrive per second.

A lag time of 0 seconds indicates that |mongomirror| is processing
entries that arrived less than one second before the latest oplog entry.

If the source {+cluster+} has indexes, |mongomirror| builds the same indexes
on the destination {+cluster+}. The progress log shows the start and end times of
the index building process. To view the progress of the index builds,
you can either:

- Use the :manual:`currentOp </reference/method/db.currentOp/#db.currentOp>`
  command on the primary node of the destination {+cluster+}. The ``command``
  field shows information about the running operation. Index building entries
  look similar to the following:

  .. code-block:: json
     :copyable: false

	 "command" : {
		"createIndexes" : "perfs",
		"indexes" : [
			{
				"key" : {
					"animal" : "text"
				},
				"name" : "animal_text"
			}
		]...

- Download the :ref:`mongodb logs <mongodb-logs>` for your destination {+cluster+}
  and search for recent entries for index-related lines. Log messages related
  to index building look similar to the following:

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false

     {"t":{"$date":"2024-08-09T16:35:50.227+00:00"},"s":"I",  "c":"INDEX",    "id":20447,   "ctx":"conn1080","msg":"Index build: completed","attr":{"buildUUID":{"uuid":{"$uuid":"c4a62739-bf19-456d-bbd6-7baa29f1063b"}}}}

Performance
-----------

To avoid contention for network and CPU resources, run |mongomirror| on
hosts other than your replica set's |mongod| instance hosts.

- |mongomirror| affects your source replica set's performance similar to having
  a secondary:

  - For the initial sync stage, the load scales with the size of your
    data set.

  - Once an initial sync completes, the load scales with oplog gigabytes
    used per hour.
