Enabling these backwards-incompatible features can complicate the
downgrade process since you must remove any persisted
backwards-incompatible features before you downgrade.

It is recommended that after upgrading, you allow your deployment to
run without enabling these features for a burn-in period to ensure
the likelihood of downgrade is minimal. When you are confident that
the likelihood of downgrade is minimal, enable these features.
