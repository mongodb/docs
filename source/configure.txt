You can define the settings that the {+mcli+} uses to interact with
MongoDB services like |service|, |cloud-short|, and |onprem| by using
the :ref:`mongocli-auth-login` or :ref:`mongocli-config` commands.
The first time you run one of these commands, the {+mcli+} creates a :ref:`configuration file
<mcli-config-file>` called ``mongocli.toml`` to store your settings.
