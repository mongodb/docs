         .. note::

            **macOS Catalina users:**

            The C authentication plugin uses OpenSSL v1.0. If you have
            OpenSSL v1.1 or greater installed, you must downgrade to v1.0
            to use the C authentication plugin. You can do so with the
            following command:

            .. code-block:: none

               brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/30fd2b68feb458656c2da2b91e577960b11c42f4/Formula/openssl.rb

            If you have both versions 1.0 and 1.1 of OpenSSL installed,
            create a symlink to version 1.0 from ``/usr/local/opt/openssl``
            and remove the symlink to v1.1.

         #. Download the `MySQL 5.7.x installer
            <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/>`__ and install the
            MySQL Community Server, which includes the MySQL shell.

         #. Download ``mongosql_auth`` plugin library from  the
            `releases page <https://github.com/mongodb/mongosql-auth-c/releases>`_.

         #. After downloading, move the file ``mongosql_auth.so`` to either:

            - ``<mysql-home>/lib/plugin/`` directory.

              The default location of ``<mysql-home>`` varies by platform.

              To discover the location of the plugin directory, run the
              following at the command line:

              .. code-block:: sh

                 mysql_config --plugindir

            \- OR -

            - A directory of your choice if you provide the
              ``plugin-dir=<your-install-dir>`` option to your MySQL client.

Using the Plugin for Authentication
-----------------------------------

Before you use the authentication plugin, you must set up authenticated
users for MongoDB. For more information on creating authenticated users,
see  :manual:`Enable Authentication </tutorial/enable-authentication/>`.
If you are using the Atlas-hosted |bi-short|, see :ref:`mongodb-users`.

The procedure for using the C Authentication plugin library varies
depending on your SQL client. The C Authentication plugin can be used
via one of the following methods:

- :doc:`DSN (Data Source Name)</tutorial/create-system-dsn>` using the
  MySQL Connector/ODBC driver. For more information, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/create-system-dsn`.

- The ``--default-auth`` option for the MySQL Shell. For more
  information, see :doc:`/connect/mysql`.

This plugin can is compatible with both the 32-bit or 64-bit versions of
the MySQL shell and MySQL Connector/ODBC driver. The installation
directory differs depending on the version you install.
