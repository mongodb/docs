This page lists active and recent :term:`groom` jobs. Groom jobs
remove unused :term:`blocks <block>` on
:term:`blockstores <blockstore>` and
:term:`S3 Snapshot Stores <S3 Snapshot Store>` to reclaim storage
space. If no existing :term:`snapshots <snapshot>` reference a given
block, it is considered *unused*. |onprem| grooms blockstores at least
once a year and :abbr:`S3 (Simple Storage Service)` snapshot stores at
least every two weeks.

A groom job forces the backup process to:

1. Write all new data to a new location,

2. Copy all existing, needed data from the old location to the new one,

3. Update references to maintain data relationships, and

4. Drop the old database.

.. admonition:: File Size Changes during Grooming
   :class: note

   During grooming operations, you may notice that the file sizes of
   blockstores and :abbr:`S3 (Simple Storage Service)` snapshot stores
   fluctuate, sometimes dramatically. This is normal during these
   operations.

You can manually direct |onprem| to move blocks between blockstores
through the :ref:`groom-priority-page`.

You can also :doc:`/tutorial/configure-block-size`.
