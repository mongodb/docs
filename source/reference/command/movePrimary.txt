.. dbcommand:: movePrimary

   In a :term:`sharded cluster`, :dbcommand:`movePrimary` reassigns the
   :term:`primary shard` which holds all un-sharded collections in
   the database.  :dbcommand:`movePrimary` first changes the primary shard in
   the cluster metadata, and then migrates all un-sharded collections to the
   specified :term:`shard`. Use the command with the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { movePrimary: <databaseName>, to: <newPrimaryShard> } )

   For example, the following command moves the primary shard from ``test`` to
   ``shard0001``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { movePrimary : "test", to : "shard0001" } )

   When the command returns, the database's primary shard location
   has switched to the specified shard. To fully decommission a
   shard, use the :dbcommand:`removeShard` command.

   .. note::

      The destination shard must rebuild its indexes
      in the foreground when it becomes the primary shard.
      The collection locks while the indexes are building,
      preventing reads and writes until the indexes are finished.
      See :doc:`/core/index-creation` for details.

   :dbcommand:`movePrimary` is an administrative command that is only available
   for :program:`mongos` instances.

Considerations
--------------

.. include:: /includes/warning-movePrimary.rst

Avoid accessing an un-sharded collection during migration.
:dbcommand:`movePrimary` does not prevent reading and writing during its
operation, and such actions yield undefined behavior.

:dbcommand:`movePrimary` may take significant time to complete, and
you should plan for this unavailability.

:dbcommand:`movePrimary` will fail if the destination shard contains a
conflicting collection name.  This may occur if documents are written to an
un-sharded collection while the collection is moved away, and later the original
primary shard is restored.
