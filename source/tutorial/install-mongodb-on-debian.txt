Install MongoDB on Debian
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Use this tutorial to install MongoDB from ``.deb`` packages on
Debian 7 "Wheezy". While Debian includes its own MongoDB packages, the
official MongoDB packages are more up to date.

MongoDB only provides packages for 64-bit Debian "Wheezy". These packages may
work with other Debian releases, but this is not a supported configuration.

.. The following include includes two h2 headers:
.. Packages and Init Scripts

.. |init-script-path| replace:: ``/etc/init.d/mongod``
.. include:: /includes/list-mongodb-org-packages.rst

Considerations
--------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-installation-64bit.rst

You cannot install this package concurrently with the ``mongodb``,
``mongodb-server``, or ``mongodb-clients`` packages that
your release of Debian may include.

.. include:: /includes/note-package-change.rst

Install MongoDB
---------------

The Debian package management tools (i.e. ``dpkg`` and ``apt``) ensure
package consistency and authenticity by requiring that distributors
sign packages with GPG keys.

Run MongoDB
-----------

.. |mongod-user| replace:: ``mongodb``
.. |mongod-datadir| replace:: ``/var/lib/mongodb``
