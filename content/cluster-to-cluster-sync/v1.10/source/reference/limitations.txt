.. warning::

   ``mongosync`` does not check for compliance with the documented
   limitations. Please ensure that your application is not affected by
   the limitations. Running ``mongosync`` in the presence of one of
   these limitations could lead to undefined behavior on the destination
   cluster.

   You must adhere to these limitations for the full duration of the the
   migration, including when the migration is paused or stopped if it will be
   resumed.

General Limitations
-------------------

.. note::

  For information on MongoDB server compatibility, see
  :ref:`c2c-server-version-compatibility`.

- ``mongosync`` does not support in-place server version upgrades that change the major or minor version during a migration. ``mongosync`` does allow patch version upgrades. 
  To learn more, see the :ref:`server upgrade instructions <upgrade-to-latest-revision>`.
- The destination cluster must be empty.
- ``mongosync`` doesn't validate that the clusters or the environment
  are properly configured.
- Other clients must not write to the destination cluster while
  ``mongosync`` is running.
- If you want to start the :ref:`commit <c2c-api-commit>`
  process and you did not set ``enableUserWriteBlocking`` to ``true``
  when you used the :ref:`c2c-api-start` endpoint, you
  must :ref:`prevent writes <c2c-api-start>` to the source cluster
  before you start the commit process. 
- :ref:`system.* collections <metadata-system-collections>` aren't
  replicated.
- Documents that have dollar (``$``) prefixed field names aren't
  supported. See :ref:`Field Names with Periods and Dollar Signs
  <crud-concepts-dot-dollar-considerations>`.
- Serverless clusters aren't supported.
- A MongoDB Shared Tier isn't supported.
- `Queryable Encryption
  <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/core/queryable-encryption/>`__
  isn't supported.
- You cannot sync a collection that has a unique index and a non-unique
  index defined on the same field(s).
- .. include:: /includes/fact-atlas-require-indexes-limitation.rst
- ``mongosync`` doesn't sync users or roles.
- .. include:: /includes/fact-applyOps.rst
- ``mongosync`` must read from the source cluster using the 
  :readmode:`primary` read preference.
- ``mongosync`` does not support source or destination clusters that 
  are currently upgrading MongoDB versions.
- ``mongosync`` does not support syncing 
  `Atlas Search Indexes
  <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/create-index/>`__.
- ``mongosync`` only supports clusters that use the :ref:`WiredTiger 
  <storage-wiredtiger>` storage engine.
- You can't sync a collection with any documents that have an empty timestamp,
  such as ``Timestamp(0,0)`` on pre-6.0 source clusters. 
- ``mongosync`` does not support documents with duplicate field names.
  For details, see :manual:`MongoDB does not support duplicate field names
  </reference/limits/#mongodb-does-not-support-duplicate-field-names>`.

MongoDB Community Edition
-------------------------

MongoDB does not test {+c2c-product-name+} with Community builds and in
most cases, MongoDB does not offer support for {+c2c-product-name+} with
Community deployments. If you would like to use {+c2c-product-name+}
with MongoDB Community Edition, contact a MongoDB sales representative
to discuss requirements and individualized options.

Unsupported Collection Types
----------------------------

- Time-series collections aren't supported.
- Clustered collections with :ref:`expireAfterSeconds
  <db.createCollection.expireAfterSeconds>` set aren't supported.

.. _c2c-sharded-limitations:

Sharded Clusters
----------------

- ``mongosync`` doesn't support sync from a sharded cluster
  to a replica set.
- ``mongosync`` doesn't support sync to a sharded cluster 
  topology with one or more arbiters.
- ``mongosync`` doesn't support sync to or from :ref:`global clusters 
  <global-clusters>`.
- Sync from a replica set to a sharded cluster has the following
  limitations:

  .. include:: /includes/limitations-rs-to-sharded.rst
    
- Within a collection, the ``_id`` field must be unique across all of
  the shards in the cluster. See :ref:`sharded-clusters-unique-indexes`
  for more details.
- The :dbcommand:`movePrimary` command cannot be used to reassign the
  primary shard while syncing.
- There is no replication for zone configuration. ``mongosync``
  replicates data, it doesn't inherit zones.
- Shards cannot be added or removed while syncing.
- ``mongosync`` only syncs indexes that exist on all shards.
- ``mongosync`` only syncs indexes that have consistent index
  specifications on all shards. 

  .. note::

     To check for index inconsistencies, see :ref:`Find Inconsistent
     Indexes Across Shards <manage-indexes-find-inconsistent-indexes>`.

- You must stop the balancer on sharded source and destination clusters
  for the entire lifetime of a migration. To stop the balancer, run the
  :dbcommand:`balancerStop` command and wait for the command to
  complete.

  .. note::

     After stopping the balancer, wait fifteen minutes before
     starting ``mongosync``. This gives the cluster time to
     finish any in progress chunk migrations.

- ``mongosync`` doesn't support running the command :dbcommand:`transitionFromDedicatedConfigServer`
  during execution.

- You must not run the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` and
  :dbcommand:`moveRange` commands on the source or destination clusters.
- The shard key cannot be :ref:`refined <shard-key-refine>` while
  syncing.
- The :dbcommand:`reshardCollection` operations from the source cluster
  are not supported during sync. 
- The maximum number of indexes per sharded collection is 63, which is
  one less than the :ref:`default limit
  <limit-number-of-indexes-per-collection>` of 64.
- ``mongosync`` only supports syncing sharded collections that have
  default :ref:`collation <collation>` settings.

Reversing
---------

- If the old source has :ref:`unique indexes <index-type-unique>` which
  are partially distributed across shards, reversing may cause failures.
  Ensure that unique indexes exist on all shards before reversing.
- .. include:: /includes/fact-reverse-limitation.rst

.. _multiple-clusters-limitations:

Multiple Clusters
-----------------

- ``mongosync`` does not support syncing multiple source clusters to one
  destination cluster. 
- One cluster cannot simultaneously be a source cluster in one
  ``mongosync`` instance and a destination cluster in another
  ``mongosync`` instance. 

.. _c2c-filtering-limitations:

Filtered Sync
-------------

Capped Collections

.. _c2c-embedded-verifier-limitations:
.. _c2c-verify-embedded-limitations:

Embedded Verifier
-----------------

Starting in 1.9, ``mongosync`` can use an embedded verifier to confirm the
successful sync of collections from the source cluster to the destination
cluster.

.. include:: /includes/fact-verifier-limitations

.. _c2c-older-version-limitations:

Pre-6.0 Migrations 
------------------

Starting in 1.10, ``mongosync`` supports migrations from source clusters running 
MongoDB server versions older than 6.0. For information on supported migration 
paths, see :ref:`c2c-server-version-compatibility`.

The following limitations apply to pre-6.0 migrations:
