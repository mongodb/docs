=========================
Restart a MongoDB Process
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

If |a-mms|-managed MongoDB process is not currently running, you
can restart it directly from the |mms| console.

Considerations
--------------

.. only:: cloud or classic

   If the Monitoring Agent cannot collect information from a MongoDB
   process, |mms| stops monitoring the process. |mms| stops monitoring a
   :program:`mongos` that is unreachable for 24 hours and a
   :program:`mongod` that is unreachable for 7 days.

.. only:: onprem

   If the Monitoring Agent cannot collect information from a MongoDB
   process, |mms| stops monitoring the process. By default, |mms| stops
   monitoring a :program:`mongos` that is unreachable for 24 hours and a
   :program:`mongod` that is unreachable for 7 days. Your group might have
   different default behavior. Ask your system administrator.

Procedure
