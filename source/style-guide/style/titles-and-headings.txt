Capitalization
--------------

- Use *AP headline-style* capitalization for most titles and headings,
  including article, chapter, table, figure, and example titles, as
  well as section and procedure headings.

- Use *sentence-style* capitalization for titles of steps in step
  files.

Guidelines for Headline-Style Capitalization
--------------------------------------------

AP headline-style capitalization uses initial uppercase letters for the
first, last, and all the significant words in the title.

Capitalize all words in the title except for the following types of
words:

- Articles (*a*, *an*, *the*) unless the article is the first word in
  the title or follows a colon
- Coordinating conjunctions (*and*, *but*, *for*, *nor*, *or*, *yet*,
  *so*) unless the conjunction is the first word in the title
- Prepositions of any length, unless the preposition is the first or
  the last word in the title or is part of a verb phrase
- The word *to* in an infinitive phrase unless to is the first word in
  the title
- Second elements attached by hyphens to prefixes unless they're proper
  nouns or proper adjectives
- Words that always begin with a lowercase letter, such as literal
  command names or certain product or software names

Style and Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the guidelines in this section to create effective and consistent
titles and headings. The following guidelines apply to all titles and
headings; special considerations for stand-alone articles, product
guides, and tables, figures, and examples follow this list.

- Create succinct, meaningful, descriptive titles and headings, and
  place the most important words first.

- Ensure that each title and heading is unique. Identical titles, even 
  between documentation sets, might compete in search results.

- Don't include "MongoDB" in a title unless the page is a product 
  landing page.

- Include articles, prepositions, and punctuation as needed for
  clarity. However, avoid using an article (*a*, *an*, or *the*) as the
  first word.

- Avoid showing both an abbreviation and its spelled-out term in a
  title or heading. To help control the length of titles and headings,
  show the abbreviation in the title or heading and then define it in
  the first paragraph of the text.

- If you show a literal term (such as a command or option name) in a
  title or heading, follow it with an appropriate noun.

- Don't end a title or heading with a colon or period. If the title or
  heading is in the form of a question, end it with a question mark.

- Don't apply font treatments (bold, italics, or monospace) to text in
  a title or heading.

- Don't include trademark symbols in titles or headings. Show the
  symbol on the first use of the trademark in text.

- Avoid having only a single heading at any level (for example, a
  single subsection in an article or section). If you find that you
  have a single heading at any one level, consider whether you can
  reorganize the information to either eliminate the heading or add a
  second one at that level.

- Avoid having more than two levels of sections within an article or
  topic. If you use more than two levels of sections, consider whether
  you can reorganize to make the structure flatter.

- Don’t "stack" titles or headings. That is, don’t immediately follow a
  title or heading with another title or heading. Text should always
  intervene between them. Ensure that such text is meaningful. If it is
  just filler text, consider whether you can restructure the content.

- Use a consistent grammatical structure for the titles and headings of
  specific types of content:

     :widths: 15 25 30 30
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Type

Standalone Articles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the preceding guidelines, use the following guidelines
when creating titles and headings for stand-alone articles on the
Support site or in other collections of documentation:

- Create article titles that don’t rely on body text or other titles
  for their meaning (that are, in other words, independent of context).
  Users should be able to tell from a title whether the information in
  the article is relevant to their needs. Avoid ambiguous one-word
  titles, such as "Overview."

- Don't number titles to indicate their placement in a series of
  articles. Indicate the order of articles within the content of the
  article, referring users to information that they should have read
  previously before reading the current article. Use links to provide
  navigation to preceding and following articles in the series.

- Start with the highest level of heading that is approved for headings
  (for example, h3), and do not skip heading levels.

Product Guides
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the preceding guidelines, use the following guidelines
when creating titles and headings for sections in product guides:

- If possible, limit titles and headings to 60 characters for
  legibility in the TOC pane.

- Consider that titles and headings are written within the context of
  the content set in which they are presented. Therefore, you can
  usually omit "context-setting" terms. For example, if the content set
  is about servers, you can usually omit "for servers" from the title
  or heading. (For example, "Attach a network to a server" can be
  shortened to "Attach a network" with no loss of clarity.)

- Define consistent heading levels, and do not skip levels.

Tables, Figures, and Examples
-----------------------------

As a general rule, tables, figures, and examples should have titles
(also called captions). However, tables, figures, and examples in
procedures and tutorials don't normally require titles.

In addition to the preceding guidelines, use the following guidelines
when creating titles for tables, figures, and examples:

-  Place the title above the table, figure, or example, not below it.

-  Tag the title as bold.

-  Avoid using a title that duplicates an article or section title.

Text Following Titles and Headings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don’t immediately follow a title or heading with another title or
heading. Instead, follow a title or heading with body text.

The body text must be independent from the title or heading. Don't use
a title or heading as an antecedent in the sentence that follows it.
That is, be sure to repeat the subject in the first sentence that
follows the title or heading, rather than using a pronoun that refers
to the title or heading as its antecedent.

       addresses.

       This article briefly describes how to do this.

Tables of Contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to using the preceding guidelines when creating titles and
headings, use the following guidelines when creating a table of
contents (TOC) for a collection of content:

-  Entries in the TOC should link only to sections in the content.
   Don't include a link to an outside resource in the TOC.

-  The text of a TOC entry should align with the text of the title or
   heading to which it links. If the link needs to be shorter, consider
   shortening the title or heading or providing a more concise title or
   heading for the TOC. An alternate TOC title or heading should convey
   the same intent of the full title or heading. To learn more, see 
   :ref:`toc-labels`.

   .. example::

      .. code-block:: rst
         :linenos:
         :emphasize-lines: 4-6, 9-10

         .. toctree::
            :titlesonly:

            Install the Operator </installation>
            Deploy Ops Manager Resources </om-resources>
            Deploy MongoDB Database Resources </mdb-resources>
            /tutorial/modify-resource-image
            /reference
            Release Notes </release-notes>
            MongoDB Community Kubernetes Operator <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-kubernetes-operator>

-  Don't manually format the TOC. TOC formatting must be consistent and
   controlled by the code.
