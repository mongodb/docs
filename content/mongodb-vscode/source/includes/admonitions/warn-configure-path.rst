To launch your selected MongoDB shell, you must:

- Install the shell you want to use, and

- Configure your machine's ``PATH`` environment variable to include 
  the filepath to your shell binary.

If you install a new version of your MongoDB shell, you will need to 
update your ``PATH`` variable to reference the new version.

- To install the legacy :binary:`mongo <mongo>`
  shell, see :manual:`The mongo Shell </mongo>`.

- To install the ``mongosh`` shell and for instructions on 
  configuring your ``PATH`` variable, see :mongosh:`Install the MongoDB Shell </install>`.
