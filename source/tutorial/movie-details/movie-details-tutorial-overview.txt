Introduction
------------

This tutorial explores features and capabilities of |charts| with
a :doc:`data source </data-sources>` containing the ``Mflix``
:atlas:`sample data provided by Atlas </sample-data/sample-mflix>`.
This sample data contains information on movies such as release year,
cast, and reviews.

With this tutorial, you will learn how to use filters to refine a large
result set down to an easily understandable chart, and use multi-series
charts to gain further insight into the data.

In this tutorial, you'll create two charts: a sorted column
chart and a scatter chart.

- The :ref:`sorted column chart <movie-details-column>`
  displays columns representing the number
  of awards won by directors with at least 50 total awards,
  sorted from highest to lowest and broken down by film genre.

- The :ref:`scatter chart <movie-details-scatter>` shows
  a diagram of movies with at least one
  award win along with their TomatoMeter rating
  and their :abbr:`MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America)` rating
  (G, PG, PG-13, or R).
