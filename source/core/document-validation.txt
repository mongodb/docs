MongoDB provides the capability to validate documents during updates and
insertions. Validation rules are specified on a per-collection basis
using the ``validator`` option, which takes a document that specifies
the validation rules or expressions. Specify the expressions
using any :ref:`query operators <query-selectors>`,
with the exception of :query:`$near`, :query:`$nearSphere`, :query:`$text`,
and :query:`$where`.

Add document validation to an existing collection using the
:dbcommand:`collMod` command with the ``validator`` option. You can also
specify document validation rules when creating a new collection using
:method:`db.createCollection()` with the ``validator`` option, as
in the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   db.createCollection( "contacts",
      { validator: { $or:
         [
            { phone: { $type: "string" } },
            { email: { $regex: /@mongodb\.com$/ } },
            { status: { $in: [ "Unknown", "Incomplete" ] } }
         ]
      }
   } )

MongoDB also provides the ``validationLevel`` option, which determines
how strictly MongoDB applies validation rules to existing documents
during an update, and the ``validationAction`` option, which determines
whether MongoDB should ``error`` and reject documents
that violate the validation rules or ``warn`` about the violations
in the log but allow invalid documents.

Behavior
--------

Validation occurs during updates and inserts. When you add validation to
a collection, existing documents do not undergo validation checks until
modification.

Existing Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can control how MongoDB handles existing documents using the
``validationLevel`` option. 

By default, ``validationLevel`` is ``strict`` and MongoDB applies
validation rules to all inserts and updates. Setting ``validationLevel``
to ``moderate`` applies validation rules to inserts and to updates to
existing documents that fulfill the validation criteria. With the
``moderate`` level, updates to existing documents that do not fulfill the
validation criteria are not checked for validity.

.. example::

   Consider the following documents in a ``contacts`` collection:

   .. code-block:: json

      {
         "_id": "125876",
         "name": "Anne",
         "phone": "+1 555 123 456",
         "city": "London",
         "status": "Complete"
      },
      {
         "_id": "860000",
         "name": "Ivan",
         "city": "Vancouver"
      }

   Issue the following command to add a validator to the ``contacts``
   collection:

   .. code-block:: sh

      db.runCommand( {
         collMod: "contacts", 
         validator: { $or: [ { phone: { $exists: true } }, { email: { $exists: true } } ] },
         validationLevel: "moderate"
      } )

   The ``contacts`` collection now has a validator with the ``moderate``
   validationLevel. If you attempted to update the document with 
   ``_id`` of ``125876``, MongoDB would apply validation rules since the
   existing document matches the criteria. In
   contrast, MongoDB will not apply validation rules to updates to the
   document with ``_id`` of ``860000`` as it does not meet the
   validation rules.

To disable validation entirely,
you can set ``validationLevel`` to ``off``.

Accept or Reject Invalid Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``validationAction`` option determines how MongoDB handles documents
that violate the validation rules.

By default, ``validationAction`` is ``error`` and MongoDB rejects any insertion or
update that violates the validation criteria. When
``validationAction`` is set to ``warn``, MongoDB logs any violations
but allows the insertion or update to proceed.

.. example::

   The following example creates a ``contacts`` collection with a validator
   that specifies that inserted or updated documents should match at least
   one of three following conditions:
   
   - the ``phone`` field is a string
   - the ``email`` field matches the regular expression
   - the ``status`` field is either ``Unknown`` or ``Incomplete``.
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
   
      db.createCollection( "contacts",
         {
            validator: { $or:
               [
                  { phone: { $type: "string" } },
                  { email: { $regex: /@mongodb\.com$/ } },
                  { status: { $in: [ "Unknown", "Incomplete" ] } }
               ]
            },
            validationAction: "warn"
         }
      )
   
   With the validator in place, the following insert operation fails the
   validation rules,
   but since the ``validationAction`` is ``warn``, the write operation
   logs the failure and succeeds.
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
   
      db.contacts.insert( { name: "Amanda", status: "Updated" } )
   
   The log includes the full namespace of the collection and the document
   that failed the validation rules, as well as the time of the operation:
   
   .. code-block:: sh
   
      2015-10-15T11:20:44.260-0400 W STORAGE  [conn3] Document would fail validation collection: example.contacts doc: { _id: ObjectId('561fc44c067a5d85b96274e4'), name: "Amanda", status: "Updated" }


Restrictions
------------

You cannot specify a validator for collections in the ``admin``,
``local``, and ``config`` databases.

You cannot specify a validator for ``system.*`` collections.

Bypass Document Validation
--------------------------

Users can bypass document validation using the
``bypassDocumentValidation`` option. For a list of commands that
support the ``bypassDocumentValidation`` option, see
:ref:`3.2-rel-notes-document-validation`.

For deployments that have enabled access control, to bypass document
validation, the authenticated user must have
:authaction:`bypassDocumentValidation` action. The built-in roles
:authrole:`dbAdmin` and :authrole:`restore` provide this action.

   :method:`db.getCollectionInfos()`.
