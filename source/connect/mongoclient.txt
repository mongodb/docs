Overview
--------

To connect to a MongoDB deployment, you need two things:

- A **connection URI**, also known as a *connection string*, which tells {+driver-short+}
  which MongoDB deployment to connect to.
- A **MongoClient** object, which creates the connection to the MongoDB deployment
  and lets you perform operations on it.

You can also use either of these components to customize the way {+driver-short+} behaves
while connected to MongoDB.

This guide shows you how to create a connection string and use a ``MongoClient`` object
to connect to MongoDB.

.. _pymongo_connection_uri:

Connection URI
--------------

A standard connection string includes the following components:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Component
     - Description

   * - ``mongodb://``

     - Required. A prefix that identifies this as a string in the
       standard connection format.

   * - ``username:password``

     - Optional. Authentication credentials. If you include these, the client
       authenticates the user against the database specified in ``authSource``.
       For more information about the ``authSource`` connection option, see
       :ref:`pymongo-auth`. 

   * - ``host[:port]``

     - Required. The host and optional port number where MongoDB is running. If you don't
       include the port number, the driver uses the default port, ``27017``.

   * - ``/defaultauthdb``
     
     - Optional. The authentication database to use if the
       connection string includes ``username:password@``
       authentication credentials but not the ``authSource`` option. If you don't include 
       this component, the client authenticates the user against the ``admin`` database.

   * - ``?<options>``

     - Optional. A query string that specifies connection-specific
       options as ``<name>=<value>`` pairs. See
       :ref:`pymongo-connection-options` for a full description of
       these options.

For more information about creating a connection string, see
:manual:`Connection Strings </reference/connection-string?tck=docs_driver_python>` in the
MongoDB Server documentation.

MongoClient
-----------

To create a connection to MongoDB, pass a connection URI as a string to the
``MongoClient`` constructor. In the 
following example, the driver uses a sample connection URI to connect to a MongoDB 
instance on port ``27017`` of ``localhost``: 

.. code-block:: python

   from pymongo import MongoClient
   
   uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017/"
   client = MongoClient(uri)

.. tip:: Reusing Your Client

   Because each ``MongoClient`` object represents a pool of connections to the
   database, most applications require only a single instance of
   ``MongoClient``, even across multiple requests. However, if you fork
   a process, the child process *does* need its own ``MongoClient`` object.
