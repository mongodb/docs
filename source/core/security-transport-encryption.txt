TLS/SSL
-------

MongoDB supports TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer)
to encrypt all of MongoDB's network traffic. TLS/SSL ensures that MongoDB
network traffic is only readable by the intended client.

MongoDB TLS/SSL implementation uses OpenSSL libraries. MongoDB's SSL
encryption only allows use of strong SSL ciphers with a minimum of
128-bit key length for all connections.

Certificates
------------

Before you can use SSL, you must have a :file:`.pem` file containing a
public key certificate and its associated private key.

MongoDB can use any valid SSL certificate issued by a certificate
authority or a self-signed certificate. If you use a self-signed
certificate, although the communications channel will be encrypted,
there will be *no* validation of server identity. Although such a
situation will prevent eavesdropping on the connection, it leaves you
vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. Using a certificate signed by
a trusted certificate authority will permit MongoDB drivers to verify
the server's identity.

For example, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl-clients`.

Identity Verification
---------------------

In addition to encrypting connections, SSL allows for authentication
using certificates, both for :doc:`client authentication
</core/authentication>` and for :doc:`internal authentication
</core/security-internal-authentication>` of members of replica sets and
sharded clusters.

FIPS Mode
---------

.. include:: /includes/fact-enterprise-only-admonition.rst

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is a U.S. government
computer security standard used to certify software modules and libraries
that encrypt and decrypt data securely. You can configure MongoDB to run
with a FIPS 140-2 certified library for OpenSSL. Configure FIPS to run by
default or as needed from the command line.

For an example, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-fips`.
