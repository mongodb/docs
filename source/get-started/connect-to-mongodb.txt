After retrieving the connection string for your MongoDB Atlas deployment,
you can connect to the deployment from your Java application and query
the Atlas sample datasets.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create your Java application file

      In your project's base package directory, create a file called
      ``QuickStart.java``. Copy and paste the following code into this file,
      which queries the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/get-started/code-snippets/QuickStart.java
         :start-after: begin QuickStart
         :end-before: end QuickStart
         :language: java
         :dedent:

   .. step:: Assign the connection string

      Replace the ``<connection string uri>`` placeholder with the connection string
      that you copied from the :ref:`java-get-started-connection-string` step of this
      guide.
      
   .. step:: Run your Java application

      Run your application in your IDE or your shell. Your output
      contains details about the retrieved movie document:

      .. include:: /includes/get-started/query-output.rst

      .. include:: /includes/get-started/jdk-tls-issue.rst

After you complete these steps, you have a Java application that
connects to your MongoDB deployment, runs a query on the sample
data, and returns a matching document.
