.. method:: sh.splitFind(namespace, query)

   Splits the chunk containing the document specified by the ``query``
   at its median point, creating two roughly equal chunks. Use
   :method:`sh.splitAt()` to split a collection in a specific point.

   In most circumstances, you should leave chunk splitting to the
   automated processes. However, when initially deploying a
   :term:`sharded cluster` it is necessary to perform some measure of
   :term:`pre-splitting` using manual methods including
   :method:`sh.splitFind()`.
