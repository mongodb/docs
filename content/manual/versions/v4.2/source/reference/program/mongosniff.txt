   MongoDB 3.4 replaces :binary:`~bin.mongosniff` with :binary:`~bin.mongoreplay`,
   a powerful traffic capture and replay tool that you can use to inspect
   and record commands sent a MongoDB instance, and then replay those
   commands back onto another host at a later time.
   
   :binary:`~bin.mongoreplay` provides a more flexible version of
   :binary:`~bin.mongosniff` to help you investigate database activity.
