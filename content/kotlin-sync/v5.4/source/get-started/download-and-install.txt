Download and Install

This guide demonstrates how to create a project and add the
{+driver-short+} dependencies by using `Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__
or `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create a {+language+} Project

      First, make sure that your system has {+language+} installed and
      running on JDK 1.8 or later.

      We recommend that you use an integrated development
      environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse IDE to
      configure Gradle or Maven to build and run your project.

      .. tip::
      
         If you are not using an IDE, see the
         `Creating New Gradle Builds
         <https://guides.gradle.org/creating-new-gradle-builds/>`__ guide 
         or the `Building Maven
         <https://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-building-maven.html>`__ guide
         for more information on how to set up your project.

      For more information on getting started with
      {+language+} and creating your first project, see `Get started with Kotlin/JVM
      <{+kotlin-docs+}/docs/jvm-get-started.html>`__ in the {+language+}
      language documentation.

   .. step:: Add the Driver Bill of Materials

      .. _kotlin-sync-get-started-install-bom:

      .. sharedinclude:: dbx/jvm/bom.rst

         .. replacement:: gradle-filename

            ``build.gradle.kts``

   .. step:: Add MongoDB as a Dependency

      If you are using Gradle to manage your
      packages, add the following entry to your ``build.gradle.kts``
      dependencies list:

      .. include:: /includes/kotlin-sync-driver-gradle-versioned.rst

      If you are using Maven to manage your
      packages, add the following entry to your ``pom.xml`` dependencies list:
      
      .. include:: /includes/kotlin-sync-driver-maven-versioned.rst

      Because you installed the BOM, you can omit a version in the
      {+driver-short+} dependency entry. The version you specify in the
      BOM determines the dependency versions to install.

      After you configure your dependencies, ensure that they are
      available to your project by running the dependency manager and
      refreshing the project in your IDE.
      
   .. step:: Add Serialization Library Dependencies

      To enable the driver to convert between {+language+} objects and BSON, the
      data format for documents in MongoDB, you must also add one or both of the
      following serialization packages to your application:
      
      - ``bson-kotlinx`` *(Recommended)*
      - ``bson-kotlin``
      
      If you are using Gradle to manage your packages, add one of the following
      entries to your ``build.gradle.kts`` dependencies list: 
      
      .. include:: /includes/serialization-libs-gradle-versioned.rst
      
      If you are using Maven to manage your packages, add one of the following
      entries to your ``pom.xml`` dependencies list:
      
      .. include:: /includes/serialization-libs-maven-versioned.rst
      
      After you configure your dependencies, ensure that they are available to your
      project by running the dependency manager and refreshing the
      project in your IDE.
      
      To learn more about these packages, see :ref:`kotlin-sync-serialization`.

After you complete these steps, you have a new project directory
and the driver dependencies installed.
