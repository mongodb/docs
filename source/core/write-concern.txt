Write Concern

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. include:: /includes/introduction-write-concern.rst

.. versionchanged:: 2.6
   A new protocol for :ref:`write operations
   <rel-notes-write-operations>` integrates write concern with the
   write operations.

For details on write concern configurations, see
:doc:`/reference/write-concern`.

Considerations
--------------

Default Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :program:`mongo` shell and the MongoDB drivers use
:ref:`write-concern-acknowledged` as the default write concern. 

See :ref:`write-concern-acknowledged` for more information, including
when this write concern became the default.

Read Isolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write Concern Levels
--------------------

MongoDB has the following levels of conceptual write
concern, listed from weakest to strongest:

.. _write-concern-unacknowledged:

Unacknowledged
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With an *unacknowledged* write concern, MongoDB does not acknowledge
the receipt of write operations. *Unacknowledged* is similar to
*errors ignored*; however, drivers will attempt to receive and handle
network errors when possible. The driver's ability to detect network
errors depends on the system's networking configuration.

Before the releases outlined in :ref:`driver-write-concern-change`,
this was the default write concern.

.. _write-concern-acknowledged:

Acknowledged
~~~~~~~~~~~~

With a receipt *acknowledged* write concern, the :program:`mongod`
confirms the receipt of the write operation. *Acknowledged* write
concern allows clients to catch network, duplicate key, and other
errors.

MongoDB uses the *acknowledged* write concern by default starting in
the driver releases outlined in :ref:`write-concern-change-releases`.

.. versionchanged:: 2.6
   The :program:`mongo` shell write methods now incorporates the
   :doc:`write concern </core/write-concern>` in the write methods and
   provide the default write concern whether run interactively or in a
   script. See :ref:`write-methods-incompatibility` for details.

.. include:: /images/crud-write-concern-ack.rst

.. _write-concern-replica-journaled:

Journaled
~~~~~~~~~

With a *journaled* write concern, the MongoDB acknowledges the write
operation only after committing the data to the :term:`journal`. This
write concern ensures that MongoDB can recover the data following a
shutdown or power interruption.

You must have journaling enabled to use this write concern.

With a *journaled* write concern, write operations must wait for the next
journal commit. To reduce latency for these operations, MongoDB
also increases the frequency that it commits operations to the journal. See
:setting:`~storage.journal.commitIntervalMs` for more information.

.. include:: /includes/note-write-concern-journaled-replication.rst

.. _write-concern-replica-acknowledged:
.. _replica-set-write-concern:

Replica Acknowledged
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:term:`Replica sets <replica set>` present additional considerations
with regards to write concern.. The default write concern only requires
acknowledgement from the primary.

With *replica acknowledged* write concern, you can guarantee that the
write operation propagates to additional members of the replica set.
See :doc:`Write Concern for Replica Sets <replica-set-write-concern>`
for more information.
