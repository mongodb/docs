   :description: Archived MongoDB documentation for products that have reached their end-of-life and are no longer supported.

====================
Legacy Documentation
====================

MongoDB recommends that you upgrade products to the most recent version
so that you can use the most up-to-date documentation. MongoDB documents
supported product versions through `MongoDB Documentation
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/>`__.

If you cannot upgrade to a supported version, MongoDB provides legacy
documentation for versions that have reached their end-of-life and are
no longer recommended for use. MongoDB does not maintain or update
legacy documentation.
