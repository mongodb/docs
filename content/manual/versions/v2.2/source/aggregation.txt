In version 2.2, MongoDB introduced the :doc:`aggregation framework
</applications/aggregation>` that provides a powerful and flexible set
of tools to use for many data aggregation tasks. If you're familiar with data aggregation in SQL, consider the
:doc:`/reference/sql-aggregation-comparison` document as an introduction to
some of the basic concepts in the aggregation framework. Consider the
full documentation of the aggregation framework here:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   applications/aggregation
   tutorial/aggregation-examples
   reference/aggregation
   applications/map-reduce

In addition to the aggregation framework, MongoDB provides simple
:doc:`aggregation methods and commands </reference/simple-aggregation>`,
that you may find useful for some classes of tasks:
