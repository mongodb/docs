Build Indexes in the Background
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

By default, MongoDB builds indexes in the foreground, which means that
these indexes block all other read and write operations to the
database while the index builds. :ref:`Background index construction
<index-creation-background>` allows read and write operations to
continue while building the index; however, these index builds take
longer to complete and result in a larger index.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/core/indexes` and :doc:`/administration/indexes`
   for more information.

Procedure
---------
To create an index in the background, add the ``background`` argument
to the :method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()` operation, as in the
following index: 

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { a: 1 }, { background: true } )

Consider the section on :ref:`background index construction
<index-creation-background>` for more information about these indexes
and their implications.
