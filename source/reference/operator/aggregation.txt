Pipeline Operators
------------------

.. note::
   .. include:: /includes/fact-aggregation-types.rst

Pipeline operators appear in an array. Documents pass through the
operators in a sequence.

Expression Operators
--------------------

Expression operators calculate values within the
:ref:`aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference`.

``$group`` Operators

Boolean Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These operators accept Booleans as arguments and return Booleans as
results.

The operators convert non-Booleans to Boolean values according to the
BSON standards. Here, ``null``, ``undefined``, and ``0`` values become
``false``, while non-zero numeric values, and all other types, such as
strings, dates, objects become ``true``.

Set Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These operators provide operations on sets.

Comparison Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These operators perform comparisons between two values and return a
Boolean, in most cases reflecting the result of the comparison.

All comparison operators take an array with a pair of values. You may
compare numbers, strings, and dates. Except for :expression:`$cmp`,
all comparison operators return a Boolean value. :expression:`$cmp`
returns an integer.

Projection Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
