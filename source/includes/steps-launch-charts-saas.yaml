  To access the |charts| application, you must be logged into

title: Select your desired |service| project, or create a new project.
ref: select-project
level: 4
stepnum: 2
content: |
  If you have an |service| `project
  <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/manage-projects/>`__
  with clusters containing data you wish to visualize, select
  the project from the :guilabel:`Context` dropdown in the left
  navigation pane.

  If you do not have a suitable existing |service| project, see
  `Create a Project
  <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/manage-projects/#create-a-project>`__
  in the |service| documentation for instructions on creating a
  new project.

title: (*Optional*) Invite people to your |service| project and shared |charts-short| instance.

  All |service| `project users
  <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/manage-users/#manage-project-users-and-teams>`__
  with `Project Roles
  <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#project-roles>`__
  other than ``Project Read Only``
  have access to the |charts-short| instance associated with that
  project. To add additional members to your |service|
  project, see `Manage Project Users and Teams
  <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/manage-users/#manage-project-users-and-teams>`__
  in the |service| documentation.
---
title: (*Optional*) Create an |service| cluster.
ref: create-atlas-cluster
level: 4
stepnum: 4
content: |
  The |charts| application makes it easy to add collections in your
  cluster as :doc:`data sources <data-sources>`. Data
  sources reference specific collections which you can access in the
  :doc:`Chart Builder <build-charts>` to visualize the data in those
  collections.

  .. note::

    You can skip this step if you already have an |service| cluster in
    the current `project
    <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/manage-projects/>`__.

  To create an |service| cluster:

  a. In the left navigation pane, click :guilabel:`Clusters`.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Build a New Cluster`.

  #. In the :guilabel:`Create New Cluster` page, choose your preferred
     cloud provider and region, cluster tier, and additional settings.
     As you build your cluster, |service| displays the associated
     cluster costs at the bottom of the page.

     .. note::

        |service| provides a Free Tier ``M0`` replica set as well as
        paid ``M10+`` clusters. Free Tier deployments have restrictions
        as compared to paid ``M10+`` deployments, but will work for the
        purposes of this setup and all |charts-short| tutorials
        offered in this documentation. For complete documentation on
        these restrictions, see
        `Atlas M0 (Free Tier), M2, and M5 Limitations
        <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/free-shared-limitations/>`_.

  #. The default cluster name is :guilabel:`Cluster0`. If you wish to
     change your cluster name, do so now, as cluster names cannot be
     changed once configured.

  #. Click the :guilabel:`Create Cluster` button to deploy
     your cluster.

  .. note::

     For complete instructions on creating an |service| cluster and
     details on all available configuration options, see
     `Create a Cluster
     <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/create-new-cluster/>`__
     in the |service| documentation.

title: Launch the MongoDB Charts application.
ref: launch-charts
level: 4
stepnum: 5
content: |
  a. In |service|, click :guilabel:`Charts` in the navigation bar.

  #. If this is the first time you are launching |charts-short|, click
     :guilabel:`Activate MongoDB Charts`. This provisions a new
     |charts-short| instance in the |service| project.

  To navigate back to the |service| :guilabel:`Clusters` view,
  click :guilabel:`Atlas` at the top-left of the |charts|
  application.

  .. note::

     When you first launch |charts|, |charts-short| automatically
     creates new :atlas:`MongoDB users </security-add-mongodb-users>` in
     your |service| project to access your cluster data. The names
     of these users have the following format:
     ``mongodb-stitch-charts-<PROJECT-NAME>-<ID>_<CLUSTER-NAME>``

     |charts| uses :stitch:`Stitch </>` to authenticate connections
     from your |service| project. As such, |charts-short| creates new
     :atlas:`IP Whitelist entries </security-whitelist>` in your
     project with the comment ``For MongoDB Stitch; do not delete``.

title: Add your desired cluster collections as data sources.
ref: verify-data-sources
level: 4
stepnum: 6
content: |
  a. In the |charts-short| application, click :guilabel:`Data Sources`.

  #. Click :guilabel:`New Data Source`. |charts-short| displays all
     |service| clusters in the project from which you launched
     |charts-short|.

  #. Click the cluster containing the collection(s) wish to add as
     :doc:`data sources <data-sources>`, then click
     :guilabel:`Connect`.

  #. Select the collections to add as data sources.

     To add all collections within a database, click the
     corresponding checkmark for the desired database. |charts-short|
     creates a separate data source for each collection selected.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Set Permissions`.

  #. Leave these options as default and click :guilabel:`Publish Data
     Source`.

     .. note::

        For detailed instructions on data source permissions, see
        :ref:`Data Source Permissions <permission-model>`.
