``AtlasNetworkContainer`` Custom Resource
=========================================

   :class: singlecol

The ``AtlasNetworkContainer`` custom resource defines a :ref:`network
container <ak8so-network-peering>` for a |service|
project. You create |vpc| peering connections between network
containers and the networks hosting your applications.

.. include:: /includes/fact-ak8so-crds.rst

|ak8so| does one of the following actions using the |service| 
:oas-atlas-tag:`Network Peering API Resource </Network-Peering>`:
   
- Creates a new network container.
- Updates an existing network container.

Examples
--------

The following examples illustrate configurations for
``AtlasNetworkContainer`` CRDs.

- The basic example configuration defines a resource that you manage
  with the same |ak8so| instance with which you manage its parent
  {+service+} project.

- The :ref:`Independent CRD <ak8so-independent-crd>` example
  configures the same network container as the basic example,
  but for a {+service+} project that you manage outside of the |ak8so|
  instance with which you manage the network container.

.. _atlasnetworkcontainer-example-basic:

Basic Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following shows an ``AtlasNetworkContainer`` custom resource for a
container named ``my-atlas-nc`` that allows you to create a |vpc|
peering connection between {+service+} and {+aws+} within the
``my-project`` project. To manage this resource in the same |ak8so|
instance as its parent {+service+} project, you must identify the
project with ``projectRef`` instead of ``externalProjectRef``.

.. code-block::

   apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
   kind: AtlasNetworkContainer
   metadata:
     name: my-atlas-nc
   spec:
     projectRef:
       name: my-project
       namespace: my-operator-namespace
     provider: AWS
     id: 66e2f2b7e69a89b66b621571
     cidrBlock: 10.11.0.0/16
     region: US_EAST_1
   
Independent CRD Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example shows an ``AtlasNetworkContainer``
:ref:`independent CRD <ak8so-independent-crd>` that enables |vpc|
peering under the same parameters enabled by the :ref:`Basic Example
<atlasnetworkcontainer-example-basic>`. To enable independent
operation, you must use an ``externalProjectRef`` instead of a
``projectRef``, and you must supply a ``connectionSecret`` directly
since this resource can't inherit API credentials from its parent
project.

.. code-block::

   apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
   kind: AtlasNetworkContainer
   metadata:
     name: my-atlas-nc
   spec:
     externalProjectRef:
       projectId: 66e2f2b621571b7e69a89b66
     connectionSecret:
       name: atlas-connection-secret
     provider: AWS
     id: 66e2f2b7e69a89b66b621571
     cidrBlock: 10.11.0.0/16
     region: US_EAST_1

Parameters
----------

This section describes the ``AtlasNetworkContainer`` parameters
available in this custom resource definition.

.. setting:: metadata.name

   *Type*: string

   *Required*

   Name that the :ref:`atlasnetworkcontainer-custom-resource` uses to
   add this network container to a project.

.. setting:: metadata.namespace

   *Type*: string

   *Optional*

   Namespace other than ``default`` that you want to contain the
   ``AtlasNetworkContainer`` custom resource.

.. setting:: spec.connectionSecret.name

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   Name of the opaque |k8s-secret| that contains the organization ID
   and :ref:`API keys <about-org-api-keys>` that |ak8so| uses to
   :ref:`connect <ak8so-access-to-atlas-ref>` to |service|.  If
   unspecified, |ak8so| defaults to one of the following options:

   - The ``spec.connectionSecretRef.name`` parameter of the parent
     ``atlasProject``
   - The default ``global`` secret, if you haven't defined the
     ``spec.connectionSecretRef.name`` for the parent ``atlasProject``

   This parameter is required for :ref:`independent CRDs
   <ak8so-independent-crd>`.
   
   .. include:: /includes/fact-ak8so-label-secret.rst

.. setting:: spec.externalProjectRef.id

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   ID of the project to which the network container belongs. You must
   specify the project ID of an existing :ref:`Atlas Project
   <manage-projects>`. You must specify this parameter for network
   containers that belong to projects managed by either:

   - A different instance of |ak8so|
   - Tooling other than |ak8so|

   For deployments that belong to projects managed by the same
   instance of |ak8so|, use ``spec.projectRef.name``. These parameters
   are mutually exclusive with each other.

.. setting:: spec.projectRef.name

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   Name of the project to which the network container belongs. You must
   specify an existing :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource`. This
   parameter applies only to network containers that belong to projects
   managed by the same instance |ak8so|.

   For network containers that belong to projects managed by either:

   - a different instance of |ak8so|
   - tooling other than |ak8so|

   use ``spec.externalProjectRef.id``. These parameters are mutually
   exclusive with each other.

.. setting:: spec.projectRef.namespace

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   Namespace in which the :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource`
   specified in ``spec.projectRef.name`` exists.

   Don't set this parameter for deployments that belong to projects
   managed by either:

   - a different instance of |ak8so|
   - tooling other than |ak8so|

.. setting:: spec.provider

   *Type*: string

   *Required*

   Cloud provider with which to support a |vpc| peering
   connection. Must be one of the following:

   - ``AWS``
   - ``Azure``
   - ``GCP``

.. setting:: spec.id

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   Unique identifier of the existing network container within
   {+service+}. This parameter is required for and limited to
   scenarios in which |ak8so| manages a pre-existing network peering
   container.

.. setting:: spec.cidrBlock

   *Type*: string

   *Required*

   CIDR block of your {+service+} network container.

.. setting:: spec.region

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   {+service+} region within which to host the network container. Must
   conform to the {+service+} format for hosting regions. This
   parameter is required for and limited to {+aws+} and |azure|
   network containers.
