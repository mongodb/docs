  Stop the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance for the secondary member.

content: |
  Prepare :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` directory for initial sync.

  For the stopped secondary member, either delete the content of the
  data directory or create a new data directory. If creating a new
  directory, ensure that the user account running :binary:`~bin.mongod` has
  read and write permissions for the new directory.

title: "Restart the secondary member with MMAPv1."
level: 5
ref: 3.0-downgrade-restart-secondary-w-mmapv1
pre: |
  Restart the 3.0 :binary:`~bin.mongod`, specifying the MMAPv1 data
  directory as the :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>`. Specify additional options as
  appropriate for the member. You do not have to specify
  :option:`--storageEngine <mongod --storageEngine>` since MMAPv1 is the default.
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
     mongod --dbpath <preparedMMAPv1DBPath>
post: |
  Since no data exists in the ``--dbpath``, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` will
  perform an initial sync. The length of the initial sync process
  depends on the size of the database and network connection between
  members of the replica set.
