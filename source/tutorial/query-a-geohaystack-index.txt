A haystack index is a special ``2d`` geospatial index that is optimized
to return results over small areas. To create a haystack index see
:ref:`geospatial-indexes-haystack-index`.

To query a haystack index, use the :dbcommand:`geoSearch` command. You
must specify both the coordinates and the additional
field to :dbcommand:`geoSearch`. For example, to return all documents
with the value ``restaurant`` in the ``type`` field near the example
point, the command would resemble:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { geoSearch : "places" ,
                    search : { type: "restaurant" } ,
                    near : [-74, 40.74] ,
                    maxDistance : 10 } )

.. note::

   Haystack indexes are not suited to queries for the complete list of
   documents closest to a particular location. The closest documents
   could be more distant compared to the bucket size.

.. note::

   :doc:`Spherical query operations
   </tutorial/calculate-distances-using-spherical-geometry-with-2d-geospatial-indexes>`
   are not currently supported by haystack indexes.

   The :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` method cannot access the
   haystack index.
