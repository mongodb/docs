To rename a replica set, you must shut down all members of the replica 
set, then configure each member's ``local`` database with the new 
replica set name.

This procedure requires downtime.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Ensure that your replica set is not sharded. The renaming procedure 
  is for unsharded replica sets only. 

- Before renaming a replica set, perform a full
  :ref:`backup of your MongoDB deployment <backup-methods>`.

- When :ref:`authentication <authentication>` is enabled, ensure that 
  your :ref:`user role <roles>` has ``find``, ``insert``, and ``remove``
  privileges on the ``system.replset`` collection in each member's 
  ``local`` database.

  .. tip::

    You can view the privileges for a role by issuing the :dbcommand:`rolesInfo` 
    command with the ``showPrivileges`` and ``showBuiltinRoles`` fields both set to ``true``.
