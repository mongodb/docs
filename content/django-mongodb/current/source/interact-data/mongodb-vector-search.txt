Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use {+django-odm+} to perform
:atlas:`MongoDB Vector Search </atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/>`
queries. This feature allows you to perform a **semantic
search** on your documents. A semantic search is a type of search that
locates information that is similar in meaning, but not necessarily
identical, to your provided search term or phrase.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``MovieWithEmbeddings`` model, which represents
the ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies`` collection from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets
</sample-data>`. The ``MovieWithEmbeddings`` model class has the following definition:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/vector-search.py
   :start-after: start-models
   :end-before: end-models
   :language: python
   :copyable:

.. include:: /includes/use-sample-data.rst

   .. replacement:: model-classes

      ``MovieWithEmbeddings`` model includes

   .. replacement:: model-imports

      .. code-block:: python

         from <your application name>.models import MovieWithEmbeddings

Perform a Vector Search
-----------------------

.. important:: Query Requirements
    
   Before you can perform MongoDB Vector Search queries, you must create a Vector Search
   index on your collection. To learn how to use {+django-odm+} to create a
   Vector Search index, see :ref:`django-indexes-vector-search` in the Create
   Indexes guide.

You can use {+django-odm+} to query your data based on its semantic meaning.
A MongoDB Vector Search query returns results based on a query vector, or an array of numbers
that represents the meaning of your search term or phrase. MongoDB compares this
query vector to the vectors stored in your documents' vector fields.

To specify your Vector Search criteria, create an instance of the ``SearchVector``
expression class provided by the ``django_mongodb_backend.expressions`` module.
This expression corresponds to the :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` MongoDB pipeline
stage. Pass the following arguments to the ``SearchVector()`` constructor:

- ``path``: The field to query.
- ``query_vector``: An array of numbers that represents your search criteria.
  To learn more about query vectors, see :term:`vectors <vector>` in the MongoDB
  Atlas documentation.
- ``limit``: The maximum number of results to return.
- ``num_candidates``: *(Optional)* The number of documents to consider
  for the query.
- ``exact``: *(Optional)* A boolean value that indicates whether to
  perform an Exact Nearest Neighbor (ENN) search. The default value is ``False``.
  To learn more about ENN searches, see :ref:`vectorSearch-enn` in the MongoDB
  Atlas documentation.
- ``filter``: *(Optional)* A filter to apply to the query results.

Then, run your Vector Search query by passing your ``SearchVector`` instance to
the :py:meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.annotate` method from {+framework+}'s
``QuerySet`` API. The following code shows the syntax for performing a Vector
Search query:

.. code-block:: python

   from django_mongodb_backend.expressions import SearchVector

   Model.objects.annotate(
      score=SearchVector(
        path="<field name>",
        query_vector=[<vector values>],
        limit=<number>,
        num_candidates=<number>,
        exact=<boolean>,
        filter=<filter expression>
      )
   )

Basic Vector Search Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example runs a MongoDB Vector Search query on the ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies``
collection. The query performs the following actions:

- Queries the ``plot_embedding`` vector field.
- Limits the results to ``5`` documents.
- Specifies an Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) vector search that considers
  ``150`` candidates. To learn more about ANN searches, see :ref:`vectorSearch-ann`
  in the MongoDB Atlas documentation.

.. io-code-block::
    :copyable: true

    .. input:: /includes/interact-data/vector-search.py
        :start-after: start-basic-example
        :end-before: end-basic-example
        :language: python

    .. output::
        :language: none
        :visible: false

        <QuerySet [<MovieWithEmbeddings: Berserk: The Golden Age Arc I - The Egg of the King>,
        <MovieWithEmbeddings: Rollerball>, <MovieWithEmbeddings: After Life>,
        <MovieWithEmbeddings: What Women Want>, <MovieWithEmbeddings: Truth About Demons>]>

.. tip::

   The preceding code example passes an arbitrary vector to the
   ``query_vector`` argument. To learn how to generate a vector that
   represents the meaning of a search term or phrase, see
   :ref:`create-vector-embeddings` in the MongoDB Atlas documentation.

Vector Search Score Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB assigns a relevance score to every document returned in a Vector Search
query. The documents included in a result set are ordered from highest to lowest
relevance score.

To include this score in your query results, you can use the ``values()`` method
from {+framework+}'s ``QuerySet`` API. Pass the ``score`` field as an argument
to the ``values()`` method.

The following example shows how to run the same vector search
query as the :ref:`preceding example <django-vector-search-basic-ex>`
and print the documents' vector search relevance scores:

.. io-code-block::
    :copyable: true

    .. input:: /includes/interact-data/vector-search.py
        :start-after: start-search-score
        :end-before: end-search-score
        :language: python

    .. output::
        :language: none
        :visible: false

        <QuerySet [{'title': 'Berserk: The Golden Age Arc I - The Egg of the King', 'score': 0.47894009947776794},
        {'title': 'Rollerball', 'score': 0.45006513595581055}, {'title': 'After Life', 'score': 0.42825883626937866},
        {'title': 'What Women Want', 'score': 0.4211753308773041}, {'title': 'Truth About Demons', 'score': 0.4194544851779938}]>
