Starting in MongoDB 7.0, a default algorithm is used to dynamically adjust 
the maximum number of concurrent storage engine transactions (including both
read and write tickets) to optimize database throughput during overload.

The following table summarizes how to identify overload scenarios for MongoDB 
7.0 and prior releases:

.. list-table::

   :widths: 30 70

   * - Version
     - Diagnosing Overload Scenarios

   * - 7.0
     - A large number of queued operations that persists for a 
       prolonged period of time likely indicates an overload. 
     
       A concurrent storage engine transaction (ticket) availibility of 
       0 for a prolonged period of time **does not** indicate an overload.

   * - 6.0 and prior
     - A large number of queued operations that persists for a 
       prolonged period of time likely indicates an overload. 

       A concurrent storage engine transaction (ticket) availibility of 
       0 for a prolonged period of time likely indicates an overload.
