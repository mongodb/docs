Welcome to the documentation for
:website:`MongoDB Cloud Manager </cloud/cloud-manager>`. Engineered
by the team who develops MongoDB, |mms| provides a complete package
for managing MongoDB deployments.

|mms-full| can automate, monitor, and back up your MongoDB
infrastructure.

Automation
----------

|mms| Automation enables you to configure and maintain MongoDB nodes
and clusters.

MongoDB Agents using Automation on each MongoDB host can maintain your
MongoDB deployments. You can
:doc:`install </tutorial/nav/install-mongodb-agent>` the
:doc:`MongoDB Agent </tutorial/nav/mongodb-agent>`. Automation can
:doc:`add hosts </tutorial/nav/add-servers>` and
:doc:`deploy and upgrade new or existing clusters </tutorial/nav/manage-hosts>`.

Monitoring
----------

|mms| Monitoring provides real-time reporting, visualization, and
alerting on key database and hardware indicators.

How Monitoring Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you activate Monitoring on a MongoDB host, Monitoring collects
statistics from the nodes in your MongoDB deployment. The Agent
transmits database statistics back to |mms| to report deployment status
in real time. You can :doc:`set alerts </tutorial/nav/alerts>` on
indicators you choose.

Backup
------

|mms| Backup provides scheduled
:doc:`snapshots </tutorial/nav/backup-use-operations>` and
point-in-time
:doc:`recovery </tutorial/nav/backup-restore-deployments>`
of your MongoDB :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` and
:manual:`sharded clusters </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`.

How Backup Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you activate Backup for a MongoDB deployment, Backup takes
snapshots of data from the MongoDB processes you have specified.

Backup Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Backups rely upon the
:manual:`MongoDB version compatibility</reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>`
of your database.
This Feature Compatibility Version ranges from the current version to
one version earlier. For MongoDB 4.2, the FCV can be ``4.0`` or
``4.2``.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: FCV 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      .. include:: /includes/backup/wtchk-process-overview-main-om.rst

      The {+mdbagent+} uses WiredTiger's incremental backup cursor to
      capture the incremental changes.

   .. tab:: FCV 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      Once backup has started, |mms| backs up the data as an ongoing
      and continuous process. This process continues creating snapshots
      as long as the head database remains synchronized with the
      database.

      .. include:: /includes/backup/legacy-process-overview-main-om.rst

      The {+mdbagent+} then tails each replica set's :term:`oplog`
      to update the backup when performing a point-in-time restore.
      The backup is consistent with the original primary up to the
      last oplog that the {+mdbagent+} supplies.

The backup process works in this manner regardless of how snapshots are
stored.

Backup uses a MongoDB instance version equal to or greater than the
version of the replica set it backs up.

Backup takes and stores snapshots based on a user-defined
:ref:`snapshot retention policy <snapshot-frequency-and-retention>`.
Sharded cluster snapshots temporarily stop the balancer. The snapshots
then can insert a marker token into all shards and config servers in
the cluster. |mms| takes a :manual:`snapshot </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>` when the marker tokens
appear in the snapshot data.

To learn more about how to configure backups, see
:doc:`Backup Configuration Options </core/backup-preparations>`.

Monthly backup costs for |mms| are based on the size per-gigabyte
of your most recent snapshot. To learn about |mms| backup pricing,
see :ref:`Backup Costs <backup-pricing>`.

Restore Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Backup can restore data from a complete scheduled snapshot or from
a selected point between snapshots.

.. tabs::
   :hidden:

   .. tab:: FCV 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      You can restore :manual:`sharded clusters </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>` and
      :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` from selected points in time.

   .. tab:: FCV 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      - For :manual:`sharded clusters </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`, you can restore
        from :ref:`checkpoints <checkpoint>` between snapshots.

      - For :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`, you can restore from
        selected points in time.

When you restore from a :manual:`snapshot </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>`, |mms| reads directly from
the snapshot storage. You can restore the snapshot:

- To another cluster.
- To download the snapshot files from an |https| link.

.. tabs::
   :hidden:

   .. tab:: FCV 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      When you restore from a point in time, |mms| does the following:
      
      1. Restores a full snapshot from the snapshot storage.
      #. Applies stored :manual:`oplogs </reference/glossary/#std-term-oplog>` until it reaches the 
         specified point.
      #. Delivers the snapshot and oplog updates using the same
         |https| mechanisms.



   .. tab:: FCV 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      When you restore from a checkpoint or point in time, |mms| does the following:

      1. Restores a full snapshot from the snapshot storage. 
      #. Applies stored :manual:`oplogs </reference/glossary/#std-term-oplog>` until it reaches the
         specified point. 
      #. Delivers the snapshot and oplog updates using the same |https| mechanisms. 
         To enable checkpoints, see :ref:`enable-cluster-checkpoints`.
