Restore a Single Shard
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Restoring a single shard from backup with other unaffected shards
requires a number of special considerations and practices. This
document outlines the additional tasks you must perform when restoring
a single shard.

Consider the following resources on backups in general as well as
backup and restoration of sharded clusters specifically:

- :doc:`/administration/backup-sharded-clusters`
- :doc:`/tutorial/restore-sharded-cluster`
- :doc:`/core/backups`

Procedure
---------

Always restore :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`
as a whole. When you restore a single shard, keep in mind that the
:term:`balancer` process might have moved :term:`chunks <chunk>` to or
from this shard since the last backup. If that's the case, you must
manually move those chunks, as described in this procedure.
