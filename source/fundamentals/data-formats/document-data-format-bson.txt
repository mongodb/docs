Overview
--------

This guide explains the BSON data format, how MongoDB uses it, and how to
install the BSON library independently of the MongoDB driver.

BSON Data Format
----------------

**BSON**, or Binary JSON, is the data format that MongoDB uses to organize
and store data. This data format includes all JSON data structure types and
adds support for types including dates, different size integers, ObjectIds, and
binary data. For a complete list of supported types, see the
:manual:`BSON Types </reference/bson-types>` server manual page.

The binary format is not human-readable, but you can use the
:ref:`Java BSON library <install-bson-library>` to convert it to a JSON
representation. You can read more about the relationship between these
formats in our article on :website:`JSON and BSON </json-and-bson>`.

MongoDB and BSON
----------------

MongoDB uses the BSON data format for reasons including:

- the underlying JSON format aligns well with the document database model
- you can store binary objects in BSON, which you cannot do in pure JSON
- the binary format enables you to send it directly over the wire
- the standardized field metadata enables efficient query and store operations

The MongoDB Java Driver, which uses the BSON library, allows you to work
with BSON data by using one of the object types that implement the
:java-docs:`Bson <apidocs/bson/org/bson/conversions/Bson.html>` interface,
including:

- :java-docs:`Document <apidocs/bson/org/bson/Document.html>` (BSON library package)
- :java-docs:`BsonDocument <apidocs/bson/org/bson/BsonDocument.html>` (BSON library package)
- :java-docs:`RawBsonDocument <apidocs/bson/org/bson/RawBsonDocument.html>` (BSON library package)
- :java-docs:`BasicDBObject <apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/BasicDBObject.html>` (Java Driver package)

For more information on using these object types, see our
:doc:`Documents guide <fundamentals/data-formats/documents>`.

Install the BSON Library
------------------------

These instructions show you how to add the BSON library as a dependency to
your project. If you added the MongoDB Java driver as a dependency to your
project, you can skip this step since the BSON library is already included
as a required dependency of the driver. For instructions on how to add the
MongoDB driver as a dependency to your project, see the
:ref:`driver installation <add-mongodb-dependency>` section of our Quick Start
guide.

We recommend that you use the `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__ or
`Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__ build automation tool to manage your project
dependencies. Select from the tabs below to see the dependency declaration
for that tool:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Maven
      :tabid: maven-dependencies

      The following snippet shows the dependency declaration in the
      ``dependencies`` section of your ``pom.xml`` file.

      .. include:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/bson-maven-versioned.rst

   .. tab:: Gradle
      :tabid: gradle-dependencies

      The following snippet shows the dependency declaration in the
      ``dependencies`` object in your ``build.gradle`` file.

      .. include:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/bson-gradle-versioned.rst

If you are not using one of the tools listed above, you can include it in
your project by downloading the JAR file directly from the
`sonatype repository <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/mongodb/bson/>`__.
