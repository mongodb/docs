MongoDB Atlas provides an Activity Feed that displays events for each
:atlas:`project </organizations-projects/#std-label-projects>`. Atlas App Services
activities are included in this feed. To view and/or download only
App Services events, you can specify a filter, as described below.

Project Activity Feed
---------------------

There are two ways to access the Project Activity Feed: through the
Atlas UI, and through the Atlas API. The following Atlas
documentation pages describe each approach:

- :atlas:`View Activity Feed in the UI </tutorial/activity-feed/>`
- :atlas:`Get All Project Events through the API </reference/api-resources-spec/v2/#tag/Events/operation/listProjectEvents>`

Filter Activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

App Services activities are a subset of
:atlas:`Atlas alerts </alerts/>`. You can filter the Project Activity
Feed results to show only App Services events, or a subset of
App Services events. To do this, click the
:guilabel:`Filter by event(s)` menu and check :guilabel:`App Services`. In the
right-hand side of the menu, you will see
all App Services events selected. Deselect any that you do not want to see.
The feed list automatically updates with each change you make.

.. note:: Filtering By App Services Application

   The Activity Feed does not support filtering events by App Services
   application, but each event (and its corresponding alert) provides context
   and routing information for the appropriate application.

The **Category** for
all App Services activities is "App Services"; within that category, there are
several **Events**:

     - Request Rate Limit

App Services Alerts
-------------------

There are default alerts that map to three of the activities listed above. In
addition, you can create custom alerts for the other App Services
activities.

Default Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

App Services default alerts trigger a notification and email to the
Project Owners. The default App Services alerts occur when:

- A Trigger has failed and cannot be restarted

- A Trigger was automatically resumed

- A Sync process has failed and cannot be restarted

- An overall request rate limit has been hit

- A Log Forwarder has failed and cannot be restarted

Custom App Services Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For any activity that is not mapped to a default alert, you can set a custom
alert at the Project level. For a list of the available App Services metrics,
refer to :ref:`app-services-metrics`.

You create App Services alerts in the same way you :atlas:`create other
Atlas alerts </configure-alerts/>`. When creating a new alert, in the
":guilabel:`Alert if`" section, select :guilabel:`App Services` from the
:guilabel:`Target`.
