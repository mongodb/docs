   |service| executes the :manual:`LDAP query template </reference/configuration-options/#security.ldap.authz.queryTemplate>`
   to obtain the LDAP groups to which the authenticated user belongs.
   Use the ``{USER}`` placeholder in the URL to substitute the authenticated
   username. The query is relative to the host specified in :guilabel:`Server Hostname`. 
   The formatting for the query must conform to `RFC4515 <https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc4515>`_
   and `RFC 4516 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4516>`_.

   If you do not provide a query template, |service| applies the default
   value: ``{USER}?memberOf?base``.
