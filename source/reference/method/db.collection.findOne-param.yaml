    Controls the fields to return. The following is a prototype
    ``projection`` argument:

    .. code-block:: javascript

       { field1: boolean, field2: boolean ... }

    The ``boolean`` can take the following include or exclude values:

    - ``1`` or ``true`` to include. The
      :method:`~db.collection.findOne()` method always includes the
      :term:`_id` field even if the field is not explicitly stated to
      return in the :term:`projection` parameter.

    - ``0`` or ``false`` to exclude.
      
    The ``projection`` cannot contain both include and exclude
    specifications except for the exclusion of the ``_id`` field.
    
    Omit the ``projection`` parameter to return **all** the fields
    in the matching documents.
