.. versionadded:: 4.0

Read concern ``"snapshot"`` is only available for multi-document
transactions.

- If the transaction is not part of a :ref:`causally consistent session
  <sessions>`, operations with read concern ``"snapshot"`` reads data
  from a snapshot of the most recent majority committed data at
  transaction start.

- If the transaction is part of a :ref:`causally consistent session
  <sessions>`, operations with read concern ``"snapshot"`` reads data
  from a snapshot of the first majority committed data that guarantees
  causal consistency with the operation immediately prior to the
  transaction start. The time of the snapshot may be after the
  transaction start to guarantee causal consistency.

Read Concern ``"snapshot"`` and Transactions
--------------------------------------------

In a multi-document transaction, read concern levels
:readconcern:`"local"` and :readconcern:`"snapshot"` are available for
:ref:`read and write operations that support read concern in a
transaction <read-concern-operations>`.

.. note::

   For the operations in a transaction, you set the read concern at the
   transaction level, not at the individual operation level.

.. seealso:: :readconcern:`"local"`

Write Operations and Read Concern ``"snapshot"``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a multi-document transaction, both the read operations and the write
operations can accept the read concern level :readconcern:`"snapshot"`.
The following write operations can accept a read concern level as part
of a transaction:

- :dbcommand:`delete`

- :dbcommand:`findAndModify`

- :dbcommand:`insert`

- :dbcommand:`update`

For a list of all operations that accept read concerns, see
:ref:`read-concern-operations`.

Causally Consistent Sessions
----------------------------

:readconcern:`snapshot` is available for transactions that are part of
a causally consistent session.

If the transaction is part of a :ref:`causally consistent session
<sessions>`, the snapshot of the majority committed data reflects the
earliest time from the transaction start time(inclusive) that
guarantees causally consistency with the prior operation in the session.
