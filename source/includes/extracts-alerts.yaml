  For each :doc:`alert </tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>` you create,
  you must set a target and a condition or metric. The *target* points to what
  changed: the |mms| component. If your *condition* becomes true or a *metric*
  falls below or rises above your set threshold, |mms| triggers an 
  alert. To learn more, see :ref:`alerts-workflow`.

     * - Host is exposed to the public Internet

       - The host is exposed to the public Internet. When configured,
         |mms| tries to make a socket connection to your hosts. If
         |mms| is able to connect, |mms| triggers the alert because the
         host is not behind a firewall and does not have authentication
         enabled.
           
         |mms| runs this check once each day.

         This is a weak security validation and should not replace
         other auditing or intrusion detection system procedures.

     * - Host is down
       - |mms| does not receive a ping from a host for more than 9
         minutes. Under normal operation, the {+magent+} connects
         to each monitored host about once per minute. |mms| waits 9
         minutes before triggering the alert to minimize false
         positives, as would occur during a host restart.

         If the host continues to be unreachable, the {+magent+}
         eventually reduces ping frequency to every 5 minutes for a
         :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` and every 20 minutes for a
         :manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos>`. If a :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` or
         :manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos>` again becomes reachable, |mms| recognizes
         the process within 5 minutes.

         .. note::
            If you need to trigger the {+magent+} to check
            immediately, you can restart the agent.

         If |mms| Automation does not manage a :program:`mongos`
         process and that process remains unreachable for 30 days,
         |mms| removes the process from the :guilabel:`Deployment` tab.
         However, if you restart the :term:`mongos` process, |mms|
         detects it within 2 minutes.

         To resolve this alert, see :doc:`/reference/alerts/host-down`.
