     |service| only allows one backup method per project. Once you
     select a backup method for a cluster in a project, |service|
     locks the backup service to the chosen method for all subsequent
     clusters in that project.

     For example, in a project where one or more clusters use 
     {{BACKUP}}, you cannot enable {{OTHER_BACKUP}} for any cluster
     in that project. 

     To change the backup method for the project, disable backups for all
     clusters in the project, then re-enable backups using your preferred
     backup methodology. |service| deletes any stored snapshots when you
     disable backup for a cluster. 
     
     Consider :ref:`creating a separate project <create-project>` 
     for clusters where a different backup method is required.
