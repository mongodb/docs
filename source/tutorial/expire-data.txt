This document provides an introduction to MongoDB's "*time to live*"
or ":term:`TTL`" collection feature. TTL collections make it possible
to store data in MongoDB and have the :program:`mongod` automatically
remove data after a specified number of seconds, or when a particular
clock time is reached.

Data expiration is useful for some types of information like machine
generated event data, logs, and session information that only need to
persist for a limited period of time.

Enable TTL for a Collection
---------------------------

TTL collections are implemented as a special index type that contains
date values. TTL relies on a background thread in :program:`mongod` that
reads the date values and regularly removes expired :term:`documents
<document>` from the collection.

To enable TTL for a collection, use the
:method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()` method to create a TTL index,
as shown in the examples below. TTL is enabled as soon as the index
finishes building.

.. note::

   When the TTL thread is active, you will see a :doc:`delete
   </core/write-operations>` operations in the output of
   :method:`db.currentOp()` or in the data collected by the
   :ref:`database profiler <database-profiler>`.

.. note::

   When enabling TTL on :term:`replica sets <replica set>`, the
   TTL background thread runs *only* on :term:`primary` members.
   :term:`Secondary` members replicate deletion operations
   from the primary.

With the exception of the background thread, A TTL index optimizes
queries in the same way normal indexes do. For this reason, there are
two different approaches to expiring documents, corresponding to two
different use-cases for querying the indexed TTL field.

In one case, expiration occurs after a certain number of seconds, which
supports querying the creation-time of documents. In the other case,
expiration occurs when a certain clock time is reached, which supports
querying the expected expiration-time of documents.

Both of these approaches to TTL are described below:

Expire after a Certain Number of Seconds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To expire documents after a certain number of seconds, give the date
field a value corresponding to the current time (i.e. when the document
was created), and give the ``expireAfterSeconds`` option a TTL value in
seconds. For example, if the current date and time is ``July 22, 2013:
13:00:00``, consider a document such as the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.log.events.insert( {
      "status": new Date('July 22, 2013: 13:00:00'),
      "logEvent": 2,
      "logMessage": "Success!",
   } )

The ``status`` field *must* hold a BSON date object or an array of BSON
date objects. To set a TTL of one hour on this collection, use the following command
at the :program:`mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.log.events.ensureIndex( { "status": 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 3600 } )

MongoDB will automatically delete documents from this
collection when at least one of the values of ``status`` is a time older
than the number of seconds specified in ``expireAfterSeconds``.

Notice that the value of ``status`` can be queried for the creation-time
of a document. Querying ``status`` is not part of the TTL feature, but
the fact that the TTL index exists makes such queries highly efficient.
Now consider a value of ``status`` other than the creation-time of the
document:

Expire at a Certain Clock Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To expire documents at a certain clock time, give the date field a
value corresponding to the time a document should expire, and give the
``expireAfterSeconds`` option a TTL value of ``0``. For example, if the
current date and time is ``July 22, 2013: 13:00:00`` as above, consider
a document such as the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.log.events.insert( {
      "status": new Date('July 22, 2013: 14:00:00'),
      "logEvent": 2,
      "logMessage": "Success!",
   } )

As above, the ``status`` field *must* hold a BSON date object or an
array of BSON date objects. Notice that the ``status`` field has a date
that is one hour in the future. That is the desired expiration time. To
set a TTL that will expire this document at that time, use the following
command at the :program:`mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.log.events.ensureIndex( { "status": 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 0 } )

Because ``expireAfterSeconds`` is ``0``, MongoDB will automatically
delete documents from this collection when at least one of the the
values of ``status`` is equal to the current time, or is in the past.

Notice that in the current case, the value of ``status`` can be queried
for the expiration-time of a document. Again, this is not a feature
of TTL, but the existence of the TTL index makes such a query highly
efficient.

Constraints
-----------

- The ``_id`` field cannot be used as a TTL index.

- TTL cannot be enabled on a field that already has an index.

- A document will not expire if the indexed field does not exist.

- A document will not expire if the indexed field is not a date
  :term:`BSON type <BSON types>` or an array of date :term:`BSON types
  <BSON types>`.

- The TTL index may not be compound (may not have multiple fields).

- If the TTL field holds an array, and there are multiple date-typed
  data in the index, the document will expire when the *lowest* (i.e.
  earliest) date matches the expiration threshold.

- TTL cannot be enabled on a capped collection, because MongoDB cannot
  remove documents from a capped collection.

.. important::

   All collections with an index using the ``expireAfterSeconds`` option
   have :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` enabled. Users cannot modify this
   setting. As a result of enabling :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes`,
   MongoDB must allocate more disk space relative to data size. This
   approach helps mitigate the possibility of storage fragmentation
   caused by frequent delete operations and leads to more predictable
   storage use patterns.
