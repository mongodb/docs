Advanced Security
-----------------

|service| supports
:ref:`Encryption at Rest via customer KMS <security-kms-encryption>`
and :ref:`LDAP User Authentication and Authorization <security-ldaps>`
in |service| projects and clusters.

Excluding |service-fullname| Enterprise and |service-fullname| Platinum
customers, |service| charges a 15% uplift to the cost of each cluster
with **LDAP User Authentication and Authorization** and/or
**Encryption at Rest via customer KMS** enabled.

Configuring **LDAP User Authentication and Authorization** for a
project enables the feature for all clusters in the project.
Configuring **Encryption at Rest via customer KMS** for a project
allows enabling/disabling the feature on per cluster basis.

Private Endpoints

   .. tab:: {+aws-pl+}
      :tabid: {+aws-pl+}

      MongoDB |service| supports private endpoints on |aws| using the
      `{+aws-pl+} <https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/>`__ feature.

      For :term:`{+dedicated-clusters+} <dedicated cluster>`, |service|
      charges you based on your usage across the following dimensions:

      - |service| :ref:`Private Endpoint 
        <privatelink-billing-endpoint>`: The sum of the hourly costs 
        incurred to host private endpoints in all |aws| regions.
      - |service| :ref:`Private Endpoint Capacity Units 
        <privatelink-billing-cu>`: The sum of the hourly costs incurred 
        to process traffic to private endpoints.

      In addition to the costs |service| charges you, |aws| charges you 
      for each |vpc| interface endpoint you create. To ensure
      {+cluster+} availability in the event of a widespread network
      outage, create |vpc| interface endpoints in at least two
      availability zones per region. |aws| also charges you for the data
      volume each |vpc| interface endpoint processes.

      .. seealso::

         `AWS PrivateLink Pricing
         <https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/pricing/>`__.

      .. _privatelink-billing-endpoint:

      |service| Private Endpoint
      ``````````````````````````

      |service| charges hourly for each region to which you deploy a 
      private endpoint. The :ref:`hourly cost <pl-region-rates>` varies 
      by region.

      .. _privatelink-billing-cu:

      |service| Private Endpoint Capacity Units
      `````````````````````````````````````````

      Additionally, |service| charges you per hour based on the traffic 
      that your private endpoint processes. The :ref:`hourly cost
      <pl-region-rates>` varies based on the amount of traffic and the 
      region to which your private endpoint is deployed.

      |service| private endpoint capacity units measure the dimensions 
      on which the |service| private endpoint processes your traffic. 
      The dimensions measured are:

      - **New connections or flows**: Number of newly established 
        connections or flows per second.
      - **Active connections or flows**: Peak concurrent connections or
        flows, sampled per minute.
      - **Processed bytes**: The number of bytes processed by the 
        private endpoint in Gigabytes (GB).

      For TCP traffic, an |service| private endpoint capacity unit 
      contains:

      - **New connections or flows**: 800 new TCP connections per 
        second.
      - **Active connections or flows**: 100,000 active TCP connections
        (sampled per minute).
      - **Processed bytes**: 1 GB per hour.

      For UDP traffic, an |service| private endpoint capacity unit 
      contains:

      - **New connections or flows**: 400 new UDP flows per second.
      - **Active connections or flows**: 50,000 active UDP flows 
        (sampled per minute).
      - **Processed bytes**: 1 GB per hour.

      For TLS traffic, an |service| private endpoint capacity unit 
      contains:

      - **New connections or flows**: 50 new TLS connections or flows 
        per second.
      - **Active connections or flows**: 3,000 active TLS connections or
        flows (sampled per minute).
      - **Processed bytes**: 1 GB per hour.

      |service| charges you only for the dimension that has the highest 
      usage during each hour across all traffic types.

      .. example::

         This provides a breakdown of costs for one hour of |tls| 
         network traffic to a private endpoint in the ``us-east-1`` 
         region:

         .. list-table::
            :header-rows: 1
            :widths: 50 25 25

            * - Dimension
              - Amount
              - |service| Private Endpoint Capacity Units Consumed

            * - New connections or flows
              - 25
              - .50

            * - Active connections or flows
              - 1500
              - .50

            * - Processed bytes
              - 2.5 GB
              - 2.5

      The **Processed bytes** dimension has the largest capacity unit
      consumption rate. For this hour, |service| charges you the 
      following for using |service| private endpoint capacity units in 
      the ``us-east-1`` region:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
