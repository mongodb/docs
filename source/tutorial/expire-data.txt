This document provides an introduction to MongoDB's "*time to live*"
or ":term:`TTL`" collection feature. TTL collections make it possible
to store data in MongoDB and have the :program:`mongod` automatically
remove data after a specified number of seconds or at a specific
clock time.

Data expiration is useful for some classes of information, including
machine generated event data, logs, and session information that only
need to persist for a limited period of time.

A special index type supports the implementation of TTL collections.
TTL relies on a background thread in :program:`mongod` that reads the
date-typed values in the index and removes expired :term:`documents
<document>` from the collection.

Considerations
--------------

- The ``_id`` field does not support TTL indexes.

- You cannot create a TTL index on a field that already has an index.

- A document will not expire if the indexed field does not exist.

- A document will not expire if the indexed field is not a date
  :term:`BSON type <BSON types>` or an array of date :term:`BSON types
  <BSON types>`.

- The TTL index may not be compound (may not have multiple fields).

- If the TTL field holds an array, and there are multiple date-typed
  data in the index, the document will expire when the *lowest* (i.e.
  earliest) date matches the expiration threshold.

- You cannot create a TTL index on a capped collection, because
  MongoDB cannot remove documents from a capped collection.

- You cannot use :method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()` to change the
  value of ``expireAfterSeconds``. Instead use the
  :dbcommand:`collMod` database command in conjunction with the
  :collflag:`index` collection flag.

- When you build a TTL index in the :ref:`background
  <index-creation-background>`, the TTL thread can begin deleting
  documents while the index is building. If you build a TTL index in
  the foreground, MongoDB begins removing expired documents as soon
  as the index finishes building.

When the TTL thread is active, you will see :doc:`delete
</core/write-operations>` operations in the output of
:method:`db.currentOp()` or in the data collected by the
:ref:`database profiler <database-profiler>`.

When using TTL indexes on :term:`replica sets <replica set>`, the
TTL background thread *only* deletes documents on :term:`primary`
members. However, the TTL background thread *does* run on secondaries.
:term:`Secondary` members replicate deletion operations
from the primary.

All collections with an index using the
``expireAfterSeconds`` option have :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes`
enabled. Users cannot modify this setting. As a result of enabling
:collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes`, MongoDB must allocate more disk space
relative to data size. This approach helps mitigate the possibility
of storage fragmentation caused by frequent delete operations and
leads to more predictable storage use patterns.

Procedures
----------

To enable TTL for a collection, use the
:method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()` method to create a TTL index,
as shown in the examples below.

With the exception of the background thread, a TTL index supports
queries in the same way normal indexes do. You can use TTL indexes to
expire documents in one of two ways, either:

- remove documents a certain number of seconds after creation. The
  index will support queries for the creation time of the
  documents. Alternately,

- specify an explicit expiration time. The index will support queries
  for the expiration-time of the document.

Expire Documents after a Certain Number of Seconds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To expire data after a certain number of seconds, create a TTL index on
a field that holds values of BSON date type or an array of BSON
date-typed objects *and* specify a positive non-zero value in the
``expireAfterSeconds`` field. A document will expire when the number of
seconds in the ``expireAfterSeconds`` field has passed since the time
specified in its indexed field. [#field-is-array-of-dates]_

For example, the following operation creates an index on the
``log.events`` collection's ``createdAt`` field and specifies the
``expireAfterSeconds`` value of ``3600`` to set the expiration time to
be one hour after the time specified by ``createdAt``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.log.events.ensureIndex( { "createdAt": 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 3600 } )

When adding documents to the ``log.events`` collection, set the
``createdAt`` field to the current time:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.log.events.insert( {
      "createdAt": new Date(),
      "logEvent": 2,
      "logMessage": "Success!"
   } )

MongoDB will automatically delete documents from the ``log.events``
collection when the document's ``createdAt`` value
[#field-is-array-of-dates]_ is older than the number of seconds
specified in ``expireAfterSeconds``.

.. [#field-is-array-of-dates] If the field contains an array of BSON
   date-typed objects, data expires if at least one of BSON date-typed
   object is older than the number of seconds specified in
   ``expireAfterSeconds``.

.. seealso:: :update:`$currentDate` operator

Expire Documents at a Certain Clock Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To expire documents at a certain clock time, begin by creating a TTL
index on a field that holds values of BSON date type or an array of
BSON date-typed objects *and* specify an ``expireAfterSeconds`` value
of ``0``. For each document in the collection, set the indexed date
field to a value corresponding to the time the document should expire.
If the indexed date field contains a date in the past, MongoDB
considers the document expired.

For example, the following operation creates an index on the
``app.events`` collection's ``expireAt`` field and specifies the
``expireAfterSeconds`` value of ``0``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.app.events.ensureIndex( { "expireAt": 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 0 } )

For each document, set the value of ``expireAt`` to correspond to the
time the document should expire. For instance, the following
:method:`~db.collection.insert()` operation adds a document that should
expire at ``July 22, 2013 14:00:00``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.app.events.insert( {
      "expireAt": new Date('July 22, 2013 14:00:00'),
      "logEvent": 2,
      "logMessage": "Success!"
   } )

MongoDB will automatically delete documents from the ``app.events``
collection when the documents' ``expireAt`` value is older than the
number of seconds specified in ``expireAfterSeconds``, i.e. ``0``
seconds older in this case. As such, the data expires at the specified
``expireAt`` value.
