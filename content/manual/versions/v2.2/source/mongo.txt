The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell is an interactive JavaScript shell for
MongoDB, and is part of all `MongoDB distributions
<http://www.mongodb.org/downloads>`_. This section provides an
introduction to the shell, and outlines key functions, operations, and
use of the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

Most examples in the :doc:`MongoDB Manual </contents>` use the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell; however, many :doc:`drivers
