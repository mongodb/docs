After you view your {+database-deployments+}, you can:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Action
     - Description

   * - :ref:`manage-clusters`
     - Manage your |service| {+clusters+} with {+cluster+}-specific 
       options.

   * - :ref:`global-clusters`
     - Manage your |service| |global-write-clusters|. |service| 
       |global-write-clusters| require that you define single or
       multi-region :guilabel:`Zones`. You can also
       :ref:`shard global collections for global writes
       <de-shard-collection-for-global-writes>`.

   * - :ref:`Manage Serverless Instances <manage-serverless-instances>` (Deprecated)
     - {+Serverless-instances+} are :ref:`deprecated <flex-migration>`.
       You can't create new {+Serverless-instances+}, but you can still
       manage them.
