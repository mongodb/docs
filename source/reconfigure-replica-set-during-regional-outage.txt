During a regional outage, your {+cluster+} might not have a primary node
if the regional outage affects a majority of the cluster's electable
nodes. You can use the {+atlas-ui+} to restore your |service| multi-region
{+cluster+} by :ref:`reconfiguring your {+cluster+} <reconfigure-cluster-procedure>`.

If you reconfigure your {+cluster+} during an outage, your {+cluster+}
might lose data in the following circumstances:

- If your MongoDB process didn't replicate write operations to the node
  that becomes primary after the reconfiguration in any {+cluster+}.
  Your replica set rolls back these writes when the unavailable members
  become available again. To learn more, see :manual:`Rollbacks During
  Replica Set Failover </core/replica-set-rollbacks/>`. 
- In :term:`sharded {+clusters+} <sharded cluster>`, if your MongoDB process 
  didn't replicate chunk migrations. The data inconsistency might cause 
  :manual:`orphaned chunks </reference/glossary/#orphaned-document>`.

.. note:: 

   If you :manual:`force a reconfiguration 
   </reference/method/rs.reconfig/#std-label-rs-reconfig-method-force>`
   for a sharded {+cluster+}, |service| adds two new nodes to the 
   :manual:`config server replica set </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>` 
   in a region unaffected by the outage. When you apply subsequent
   :ref:`cluster changes <scale-cluster>` after the sharded {+cluster+}
   becomes healthy, |service| removes the additional nodes.

Prerequisites
-------------

Your {+cluster+} must be experiencing a total outage of nodes in one or more
regions with at least one electable node remaining in another region. 
To learn how to simulate a regional outage for your multi-region {+cluster+}, 
see :ref:`test-outage`.

For assistance with other causes of node outages, :ref:`contact support
<request-support>`.

.. _reconfigure-cluster-procedure:

Procedure
---------

To restore your |service| multi-region {+cluster+} from an outage, you
must manually reconfigure your replica set:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Edit Config`.

   .. step:: Select the {+cluster+} you want to recover from the drop-down menu.
       
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region`.
      
      Under :guilabel:`Electable nodes for high availability`, you
      can add new nodes to:

      - An existing region by editing the number of nodes in the :guilabel:`Nodes` column
      - A new region by clicking :guilabel:`+ Add a provider/region` 

      .. tip::

         We strongly advise not adding nodes to one of the regions with
         an outage.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Review Changes`. 

      Read the :guilabel:`Considerations for force configuration`, and
      check the box next to :guilabel:`I have reviewed these
      considerations for force configuration and agree to proceed`.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Apply Changes`.
