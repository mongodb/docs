Overview
--------

You can add, remove, and reconfigure members in a :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`
directly in the |mms| console.

.. include:: /includes/fact-node-restarts-elections.rst

Procedures
----------

.. _add-member-to-rs:

Add a Replica Set Member
++++++++++++++++++++++++

You must have an existing server to which to deploy the new replica set
member. To add a member to an existing
replica set, increasing the size of the set:

.. include:: /includes/steps-add-replica-set-member.rst

.. important::
   
   To avoid disrupting majority writes, new members are now
   added to :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` as ``priority=0``,
   ``votes=0`` until they reach secondary state, after which |mms|
   automatically updates the configuration to match the
   :manual:`priority
   </reference/replica-configuration/#rsconf.members[n].priority>`
   and :manual:`votes
   </reference/replica-configuration/#rsconf.members[n].votes>` value
   specified in the deployment.

Edit a Replica Set Member
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

To reconfigure a member as an :manual:`arbiter </core/replica-set-arbiter>`,
see :ref:`replace-member-with-arbiter`

.. include:: /includes/steps-edit-replica-set-member.rst

.. _replace-member-with-arbiter:

Replace a Member with an Arbiter
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You cannot directly reconfigure a member as an arbiter. Instead, you must must
add a new member to the replica set as an arbiter. Then you must shut down an
existing secondary.

.. include:: /includes/steps-replace-member-with-arbiter.rst

Remove a Replica Set Member
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When you remove a member from a replica set, |mms| converts the
member's :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` to a standalone process and shuts it down.

When removing members, you must keep a majority of voting members active with
respect to the original number of voting members. Without a majority, the
primary replica set member steps down and the replica set becomes read-only. 
For more information on voting, see :manual:`Replica Set Elections </core/replica-set-elections>`
and :manual:`Replica Set High Availability
</core/replica-set-high-availability>` in the MongoDB Manual.

Removing members might affect the ability of the replica set to acknowledge
writes, depending on the level of :term:`write concern` you use. For more
information, see :manual:`Write Concern </reference/write-concern>` in the
MongoDB manual.

To remove a member:

.. include:: /includes/steps-remove-replica-set-member.rst
