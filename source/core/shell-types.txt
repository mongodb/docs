MongoDB :term:`BSON` provides support for additional data types than
:term:`JSON`. :driver:`Drivers </>` provide native
support for these data types in host languages and the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell also provides several helper classes to support
the use of these data types in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` JavaScript
shell. See the :doc:`Extended JSON </reference/mongodb-extended-json>`
reference for additional information.

Date
~~~~

The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides various methods to return the date,
either as a string or as a ``Date`` object:

- ``Date()`` method which returns the current date as a string.

- ``new Date()`` constructor which returns a ``Date`` object using the
  ``ISODate()`` wrapper.

- ``ISODate()`` constructor which returns a ``Date`` object using the
  ``ISODate()`` wrapper.

Return Date as a String
```````````````````````

To return the date as a string, use the ``Date()`` method, as in the
following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var myDateString = Date();

To print the value of the variable, type the variable name in the
shell, as in the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   myDateString

The result is the value of ``myDateString``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   Wed Dec 19 2012 01:03:25 GMT-0500 (EST)

To verify the type, use the ``typeof`` operator, as in the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   typeof myDateString

The operation returns ``string``.

Return ``Date``
```````````````

The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell wraps objects of ``Date`` type with the
``ISODate`` helper; however, the objects remain of type ``Date``.

The following example uses both the ``new Date()`` constructor and the
``ISODate()`` constructor to return ``Date`` objects.

.. code-block:: javascript

   var myDate = new Date();
   var myDateInitUsingISODateWrapper = ISODate();

You can use the ``new`` operator with the ``ISODate()`` constructor as
well.

To print the value of the variable, type the variable name in the
shell, as in the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   myDate

The result is the ``Date`` value of ``myDate`` wrapped in the
``ISODate()`` helper:

.. code-block:: javascript

   ISODate("2012-12-19T06:01:17.171Z")

To verify the type, use the ``instanceof`` operator, as in the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   myDate instanceof Date
   myDateInitUsingISODateWrapper instanceof Date

The operation returns ``true`` for both.

ObjectId
~~~~~~~~

The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the ``ObjectId()`` wrapper class
around the :ref:`objectid` data type. To generate a new ObjectId, use
the following operation in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   new ObjectId

.. see:: 

   :method:`ObjectId`

.. _shell-type-long:

NumberLong
~~~~~~~~~~

The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell treats all numbers as floating-point values
by default. The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the ``NumberLong()``
wrapper to handle 64-bit integers.

The ``NumberLong()`` wrapper accepts the long as a string:

.. code-block:: javascript

   NumberLong("2090845886852")

The following examples use the ``NumberLong()`` wrapper to write to the
collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.insertOne( { _id: 10, calc: NumberLong("2090845886852") } )
   db.collection.updateOne( { _id: 10 },
                         { $set:  { calc: NumberLong("2555555000000") } } )
   db.collection.updateOne( { _id: 10 },
                         { $inc: { calc: NumberLong("5") } } )

Retrieve the document to verify:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.findOne( { _id: 10 } )

In the returned document, the ``calc`` field contains a
``NumberLong`` object:

.. code-block:: bash

   { "_id" : 10, "calc" : NumberLong("2555555000005") }

If you use the :update:`$inc` to increment the value of a field that
contains a ``NumberLong`` object by a **float**, the data type changes
to a floating point value, as in the following example:

#. Use :update:`$inc` to increment the ``calc`` field by ``5``, which the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell treats as a float:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.updateOne( { _id: 10 },
                            { $inc: { calc: 5 } } )

#. Retrieve the updated document:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.findOne( { _id: 10 } )

   In the updated document, the ``calc`` field contains a floating
   point value:

   .. code-block:: bash

      { "_id" : 10, "calc" : 2555555000010 }

.. note::

   Although the ``NumberLong()`` constructor accepts ``integer`` values
   from the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell (i.e. without quotes), this is
   not recommended. Specifying an integer value larger than JavaScript's
   defined ``Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`` (which is the number
   ``2^53 - 1``) may lead to unexpected behavior.

.. _shell-type-int:

NumberInt
~~~~~~~~~

The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell treats all numbers as floating-point values
by default. The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the ``NumberInt()``
constructor to explicitly specify 32-bit integers.

.. _shell-type-decimal:

NumberDecimal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 3.4

The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell treats all numbers as 64-bit floating-point
``double`` values by default. The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the
``NumberDecimal()`` constructor to explicitly specify 128-bit
decimal-based floating-point values capable of emulating decimal
rounding with exact precision. This functionality is intended for
applications that handle
:doc:`monetary data </tutorial/model-monetary-data>`, such as
financial, tax, and scientific computations. 

The ``decimal`` :doc:`BSON type </reference/bson-types>`
uses the IEEE 754 decimal128 floating-point numbering format which
supports 34 decimal digits (i.e. significant digits) and an exponent
range of −6143 to +6144.

The ``NumberDecimal()`` constructor accepts the ``decimal`` value as a
string:

.. code-block:: javascript

   NumberDecimal("1000.55")
   
The value is stored in the database as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   NumberDecimal("1000.55")

The ``NumberDecimal()`` constructor also accepts ``double`` values from
the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell (i.e. without quotes), although this is not
recommended due to the risk of losing precision. The constructor
creates a binary-based ``double`` precision representation of the
decimal-based parameter (potentially losing precision), then
converts that value to a ``decimal`` value with a precision of 15
digits. The following example passes the value implicitly as a
``double`` and shows how it is created with a precision of 15 digits:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   NumberDecimal(1000.55)
   
The value is stored in the database as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   NumberDecimal("1000.55000000000")

The following example passes the value implicitly as a ``double`` and
shows how a loss of precision can occur:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   NumberDecimal(9999999.4999999999)
   
The value is stored in the database as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   NumberDecimal("9999999.50000000")


.. note:: 

   To use the ``decimal`` data type with a
   :driver:`MongoDB driver </>`, be sure to use a driver
   version that supports it.

Equality and Sort Order
```````````````````````

Values of the ``decimal`` type are compared and sorted with other
numeric types based on their actual numeric value.  Numeric values
of the binary-based ``double`` type generally have approximate
representations of decimal-based values and may not be exactly
equal to their ``decimal`` representations, so use the
``NumberDecimal()`` constructor when checking the equality of
``decimal`` values. Consider the following examples with the following
documents in the ``numbers`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "val" : NumberDecimal( "9.99" ), "description" : "Decimal" }
   { "_id" : 2, "val" : 9.99, "description" : "Double" }
   { "_id" : 3, "val" : 10, "description" : "Double" }
   { "_id" : 4, "val" : NumberLong("10"), "description" : "Long" }
   { "_id" : 5, "val" : NumberDecimal( "10.0" ), "description" : "Decimal" }

When the queries from the table below are plugged into the
``db.numbers.find(<query>)`` method, the following results are
returned:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Query
     - Results

   * - **{ "val": 9.99 }**
     - **{ "_id": 2, "val": 9.99, "description": "Double" }**
     
   * - **{ "val": NumberDecimal( "9.99" ) }**
     - **{ "_id": 1, "val": NumberDecimal( "9.99" ), "description": "Decimal" }**

   * - **{ val: 10 }**
     - | **{ "_id": 3, "val": 10, "description": "Double" }**
       | **{ "_id": 4, "val": NumberLong(10), "description": "Long" }**
       | **{ "_id": 5, "val": NumberDecimal( "10.0" ), "description": "Decimal" }**

   * - **{ val: NumberDecimal( "10" ) }**
     - | **{ "_id": 3, "val": 10, "description": "Double" }**
       | **{ "_id": 4, "val": NumberLong(10), "description": "Long" }**
       | **{ "_id": 5, "val": NumberDecimal( "10.0" ), "description": "Decimal" }**


The first query, ``{ "val": 9.99 }``, implicitly searches for the
``double`` representation of ``9.99`` which is not equal to the
``decimal`` representation of the value.

The ``NumberDecimal()`` constructor is used to query for the document
with the ``decimal`` representation of ``9.99``. Values of the
``double`` type are excluded because they do not match the exact value
of the ``decimal`` representation of ``9.99``.

Matching values of all numeric types are returned when querying for
whole numbers. For example, querying for a ``double`` representation of
``10`` will include a ``decimal`` representation of ``10.0`` in the
results and vice versa.

Checking for ``decimal`` Type
`````````````````````````````

To test for ``decimal`` type, use the :query:`$type` operator with the
string alias ``"decimal"`` or ``19``, the numeric code for the
``decimal`` type.
 
.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.find( { price: { $type: "decimal" } } )

.. _check-types-in-shell:
      
Check Types in the ``mongo`` Shell
----------------------------------

To determine the type of fields, the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides
the ``instanceof`` and ``typeof`` operators.


``instanceof``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``instanceof`` returns a boolean to test if a value is an instance of
some type.

For example, the following operation tests whether the ``_id`` field is
an instance of type ``ObjectId``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   mydoc._id instanceof ObjectId

The operation returns ``true``.

``typeof``
~~~~~~~~~~

``typeof`` returns the type of a field.

For example, the following operation returns the type of the ``_id``
field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   typeof mydoc._id

In this case ``typeof`` will return the more generic ``object`` type
rather than ``ObjectId`` type.
