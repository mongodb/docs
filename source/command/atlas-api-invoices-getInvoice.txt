`Public Preview: please provide feedback at <https://feedback.mongodb.com/forums/930808-atlas-cli>`_: Returns one invoice that MongoDB issued to the specified organization.

A unique 24-hexadecimal digit string identifies the invoice. You can choose to receive this invoice in JSON or CSV format. To use this resource, the requesting API Key must have the Organization Billing Viewer, Organization Billing Admin, or Organization Owner role. If you have a cross-organization setup, you can query for a linked invoice if you have the Organization Billing Admin or Organization Owner role.
To compute the total owed amount of the invoice - sum up total owed amount of each payment included into the invoice. To compute payment's owed amount - use formula totalBilledCents * unitPrice + salesTax - startingBalanceCents.

This command is autogenerated and corresponds 1:1 with the Atlas API endpoint https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/v2/#tag/Invoices/operation/getInvoice.

For more information and examples, see the referenced API documentation linked above.
