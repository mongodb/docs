their data collections within MongoDB and
perform queries, without requiring knowledge of MongoDB

|compass| provides users with a graphical view of their MongoDB
schema by randomly sampling a subset of documents from the
collection. Sampling documents minimizes
performance impact on the database and can produce results quickly.
See the :ref:`FAQ<compass-faq-sampling>`
for further information on sampling.
