   Sources of Data Transfer Costs
   ------------------------------

   |service| data transfer costs depend on the cloud service provider
   hosting your {+database-deployment+}. |service| tabulates data transfer 
   costs daily.

   .. selected-content::
      :selections: azure

      |service| charges for data transfer between your |service| node
      and another node. The following transfers incur costs, listed in order
      of lowest cost to highest:

      1. Data transfer using in-region VNet peering.

      #. Data transfer to a different region. Data transfer charges for an |service|
         cluster depend on the geographic location of the source node.

      #. Data transfer using cross-region VNet peering.

      Transfer Cost Exceptions and Behavior
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      |service| doesn't charge for incoming data transfers to an |service|
      {+cluster+}. Additionally, |service| doesn't charge ``M0`` or {+Flex-cluster+} 
      tiers for outgoing data.

      |azure| Data Transfer Costs
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      |service| charges for data transfer between your |service| node
      and another node. The following transfers incur costs, listed in order
      of lowest cost to highest:

      1. Data transfer in the same |aws| region.

      #. Data transfer between different |aws| regions.

      #. Data transfer to a location outside of an |aws| region, 
         excluding incoming transfers to the |service| node.

      To learn more about cloud backup snapshot export, see 
      :ref:`cloud-provider-snapshot-export`.

      Transfer Cost Exceptions and Behavior
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      |service| doesn't charge for incoming data transfers to an |service|
      {+cluster+}. Additionally, |service| doesn't charge ``M0`` or {+Flex-cluster+} 
      tiers for outgoing data.

      For |aws| clusters deployed outside of the North America region where 
      the |service| Control Plane is located, invoices will include an 
      ``AWS Data Transfer (different region)`` item that results from the 
      inherited network traffic, such as heartbeats, the automation agent, 
      and the |pa|, sent between the |aws| North America region with the 
      |service| control plane, and the |aws| region where the clusters are 
      deployed.

      |service| charges for data transfer between your |service| node
      and another node. The following transfers incur costs, listed in order
      of lowest cost to highest:

      1. Data transfer between zones in the same region.

      #. Data transfer between regions in the United States of America.

      #. Data transfer between continents.

      #. Data transfer between regions in the same continent 
         other than the United States of America.

      #. Data transfer to a location outside of a |gcp| data center, 
         excluding incoming transfers to the |service| node.

      Transfer Cost Exceptions and Behavior
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      |service| doesn't charge for incoming data transfers to an |service|
      {+cluster+}. Additionally, |service| doesn't charge ``M0`` or {+Flex-cluster+}

           - $0.02 to $0.15

   {+Clusters+}
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Multi-region {+clusters+} might have higher
   data transfer costs depending on the number and location of additional
   regions, as well as the number of {+clusters+} deployed to each region.

   Push-based Log Exports
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Exporting :ref:`push-based logs <mongodb-logs-push>` 
   incurs costs for data transfer.

   .. note:: 

      Data transfer pricing varies by the cloud provider 
      and region of the source, and destination. 
      For incurred data transfer costs, refer to your |service| invoice. 

   Additional Data Transfer Usage
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   While application traffic drives the majority of your costs, 
   essential platform operations contribute small amounts of additional 
   data transfer to your aggregate billing. These background processes 
   ensure the health, security, and performance of your deployment.

   The underlying cloud provider bills this traffic as part of the 
   total network usage required to maintain your managed service.      

   Live Migrate Your Data to |service|
   -----------------------------------

   MongoDB hosts and operates the free |service| Live Migration Service to
   help users migrate existing MongoDB databases to |service-fullname|.
   MongoDB doesn't charge for any incoming data transfers to an |service|
   {+database-deployment+}.

   How to Reduce Data Transfer Costs
   ---------------------------------

   The vast majority of |service| customers spend less than 10% of their
   budget on data transfer. If you are spending significantly more, some
   of these optimizations may reduce your data transfer costs:

   - Check all applications and processes that access your data for
     inefficiencies. Ensure that queries do not:

     - Re-read data that already exists on the client.

     - Re-write existing data to your {+database-deployment+}.

   - Ensure that queries originate from the same cloud
     region and provider as your {+database-deployment+} whenever possible.

     When cross-region queries are necessary:

     - Ensure read queries
       :manual:`use the preference "nearest."</core/read-preference>`

     - Source write queries from your :guilabel:`Highest Priority Region`
       whenever possible. For more information on region priorities, see
       :ref:`Electable Nodes for High Availability
       <deploy-across-multiple-regions>`.

   - Perform query operations with :manual:`projection </tutorial/project-fields-from-query-results/#project-fields-to-return-from-query>` 
     to specify or restrict the fields that MongoDB returns in matching documents, 
     thereby limiting the amount of data that MongoDB sends to applications. 
     Alternatively, project document fields using the :pipeline:`$project` aggregation 
     stage from the :manual:`Aggregation Framework </aggregation>` to 
     reduce the size of a document before you transfer it.

   - Enable network compression in your client driver to compress data between 
     the client and the server. As an example, you can configure the 
     :driver:`network compression </node/current/fundamentals/connection/network-compression/>` 
     option for your Node.js driver. |service| always compresses intra-cluster 
     communication. To learn more, see the :driver:`Driver's Documentation </>`.

   .. note::

      Queries from on-premises environments into |service|, across cloud
      providers, or between continents on the same cloud provider incur
      the greatest data transfer costs.
