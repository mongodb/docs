Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to update
documents in a MongoDB collection by using the ``updateOne()`` and
``updateMany()`` methods.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

The documents in this collection are modeled by the following {+language+} data class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/update.kt
   :start-after: start-data-class
   :end-before: end-data-class
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

Update Operations
-----------------

You can update documents in MongoDB by using the following methods:

- ``updateOne()``, which updates *the first document* that matches the search criteria
- ``updateMany()``, which updates *all documents* that match the search criteria

Each update method requires the following parameters:

- **Query filter**, which matches which documents to update. To learn
  more about query filters, see the :ref:`kotlin-sync-specify-query`
  guide.

- **Update document**, which specifies the update operator, or the kind of update to
  perform, and the fields and values to be updated. For a list of update
  operators and their usages, see the :manual:`Field Update Operators
  guide page</reference/operator/update-field/>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

Update One Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``updateOne()`` method to update the
``name`` value of a document from ``"Happy Garden"`` to ``"Mountain
House"``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/update.kt
   :start-after: start-update-one
   :end-before: end-update-one
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

Update Many Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``updateMany()`` method to update all documents
in which the ``name`` value is ``"Starbucks"``. The update renames the
``address`` field to ``location``.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/update.kt
   :start-after: start-update-many
   :end-before: end-update-many
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

Customize the Update Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``updateOne()`` and ``updateMany()`` methods optionally accept
a parameter that sets options to configure the update operation.
If you don't specify any options, the driver performs update
operations with default settings.

The following table describes the setter methods that you can use to
configure an ``UpdateOptions`` instance:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``upsert()``
     - | Specifies whether the update operation performs an upsert operation if no 
         documents match the query filter. For more information, see the :manual:`upsert
         statement </reference/command/update/#std-label-update-command-upsert>`
         in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
       | Defaults to ``false``

   * - ``sort(Bson sort)``
     - | Sets the sort criteria to apply to the operation. If multiple
         documents match the query filter that you pass to the
         ``updateOne()`` method, the operation updates the first
         result. You can set this option to apply an order to matched
         documents to have more control over which document is updated.

   * - ``bypassDocumentValidation()``
     - | Specifies whether the update operation bypasses document validation. This lets you 
         update documents that don't meet the schema validation requirements, if any 
         exist. For more information about schema validation, see :manual:`Schema
         Validation </core/schema-validation/#schema-validation>` in the MongoDB
         Server manual.
       | Defaults to ``false``.

   * - ``collation()``
     - | Specifies the kind of language collation to use when sorting
         results. For more information, see :manual:`Collation </reference/collation/#std-label-collation>`
         in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``arrayFilters()``
     - | Provides a list of filters that you specify to select which
         array elements the update applies to.

   * - ``hint()``
     - | Sets the index to use when matching documents. 
         For more information, see the :manual:`hint statement </reference/command/update/#std-label-update-command-hint>`
         in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``let()``
     - | Provides a map of parameter names and values to set top-level
         variables for the operation. Values must be constant or closed
         expressions that don't reference document fields. For more information,
         see the :manual:`let statement
         </reference/command/update/#std-label-update-let-syntax>` in the
         {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``comment()``
     - | Sets a comment to attach to the operation. For more
         information, see the :manual:`update command
         fields </reference/command/update/#update>` guide in the
         {+mdb-server+} manual for more information.

Modify Update Example
`````````````````````

The following code uses the ``updateOne()`` method to match documents
in which the ``name`` field value is ``"Sunrise Pizzeria"``. It then
sets the ``borough`` value in the first matching document to
``"Queens"`` and the ``cuisine`` value to ``"Italian"``.

Because the ``upsert`` option is set to ``true``, the driver inserts a
new document that has the fields and values specified in the update
document if the query filter doesn't match any existing documents.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/update.kt
   :start-after: start-update-options
   :end-before: end-update-options
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

Return Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``updateOne()`` and ``updateMany()`` methods each return an ``UpdateResult`` 
object. You can use the following methods to access information from
an ``UpdateResult`` instance:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``getMatchedCount()``
     - | Returns the number of documents that matched the query filter, regardless of
         how many updates were performed.

   * - ``getModifiedCount()``
     - | Returns the number of documents modified by the update operation. If an updated
         document is identical to the original, it is not included in this
         count.
         
   * - ``wasAcknowledged()``
     - | Returns ``true`` if the server acknowledged the result.

   * - ``getUpsertedId()``
     - | Returns the ``_id`` value of the document that was upserted
         in the database, if the driver performed an upsert.

.. note::

   If the ``wasAcknowledged()`` method returns ``false``, trying to
   access other information from the ``UpdateResult`` instance results in an
   ``InvalidOperation`` exception. The driver cannot 
   determine these values if the server does not acknowledge the write
   operation.
