===================================
Retrieve Distinct Values of a Field
===================================

You can retrieve a list of distinct values for a field across a
collection by calling the ``distinct()`` method on a ``MongoCollection``
object. Pass the document field name as the first parameter and the class 
you want to cast the results to as the type parameter. 

The following snippets demonstrate the ``distinct()`` method using the ``movies``
collection in the ``sample_mflix`` sample database. Documents are modeled 
with the following Kotlin data class:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/DistinctTest.snippet.example-data-class.kt
   :language: kotlin

The following method call returns each distinct value of the ``countries`` 
field in the ``movies`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/DistinctTest.snippet.simple-distinct.kt
   :language: kotlin

You can specify a field on the document or one within an **embedded document**
using **dot notation**. The following method call returns each distinct
value of the ``wins`` field in the ``awards`` embedded document:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/DistinctTest.snippet.dot-notation.kt
   :language: kotlin

You can also limit the set of documents from which your MongoDB instance retrieves 
distinct values with a query filter as a second parameter, as follows:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/DistinctTest.snippet.filter.kt
   :language: kotlin

The ``distinct()`` method returns an object that implements the
``DistinctFlow`` class, which contains methods to access, organize, and traverse 
the results. ``DistinctFlow`` delegates to the ``Flow`` interface
from the Kotlin Coroutines library, allowing access to methods such as ``first()`` and 
``firstOrNull()``.

For more information, see our
:doc:`guide on Accessing Data From a Flow </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/flow/>`.

Example
-------

The following example retrieves a list of distinct values for the ``year``
document field from the ``movies`` collection. It uses a query filter to
match movies that include "Carl Franklin" as one of the values in the
``directors`` array.

When you run the example, you should see output that reports each distinct
year for all the movies that Carl Franklin was included as a director.
