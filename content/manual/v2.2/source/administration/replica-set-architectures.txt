There is no single ideal :term:`replica set` architecture for
every deployment or environment. Indeed the flexibility of replica sets
might be their greatest strength. This document describes the most
commonly used deployment patterns for replica sets. The descriptions
are necessarily not mutually exclusive, and you can combine features
of each architecture in your own deployment.

For an overview of operational practices and background information,
see the :ref:`replica-set-architecture` topic in the :doc:`/core/replication`
document.

.. _replica-set-three-members:

Three Member Sets
-----------------

The minimum *recommended* architecture for a replica set consists of:

- One :term:`primary <primary>` and

- Two :term:`secondary <secondary>` members, either of which can become
  the primary at any time.

  This makes :ref:`failover <replica-set-failover>` possible and ensures
  there exists two full and independent copies of the data set at all
  times. If the primary fails, the replica set elects another member as
  primary and continues replication until the primary recovers.

.. note::

   While not *recommended*, the minimum *supported* configuration for
   replica sets includes one :term:`primary`, one :term:`secondary`, and
   one :ref:`arbiter <replica-set-arbiters>`. The arbiter requires fewer
   resources and lowers costs but sacrifices operational flexibility and
   redundancy.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set`.

Sets with Four or More Members
------------------------------

To increase redundancy or to provide additional resources for
distributing secondary read operations, you can add additional members
to a replica set.

When adding additional members, ensure the following architectural
conditions are true:

- The set has an odd number of voting members.

  If you have an *even* number of voting members, deploy an :ref:`arbiter
  <replica-set-arbiters>` to create an odd number.

- The set has no more than 7 voting members at a time.

- Members that cannot function as primaries in a :term:`failover` have
  their :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].priority` values set to
  ``0``.

  If a member cannot function as a primary because of resource or
  network latency constraints a
  :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].priority` value of ``0``
  prevents it from being a primary. Any member with a ``priority``
  value greater than ``0`` is available to be a primary.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/tutorial/expand-replica-set`.

.. _replica-set-geographical-distribution:

Geographically Distributed Sets
-------------------------------

A geographically distributed replica set provides data recovery should
one data center fail. These sets include at least one member in a
secondary data center.

In many circumstances, these deployments consist of the following:

- One :term:`primary <primary>` in the first (i.e., primary) data
  center.

- One :term:`secondary <secondary>` member in the primary data center.
  This member can become the primary member at any time.

- One secondary member in a secondary data center.

If the primary is unavailable, the replica set will elect a new primary
from the primary data center.

If the *connection* between the primary and secondary data centers fails,
the member in the secondary center cannot independently become the
primary.

If the primary data center fails, you can manually recover the data
set from the secondary data center.

When you add a secondary data center, make sure to keep an odd number of
members overall to prevent ties during elections for primary by
deploying an :ref:`arbiter <replica-set-arbiters>` in your
primary data center. For example, if you have three members in the
primary data center and add a member in a secondary center, you create
an even number. To create an odd number and prevent ties, deploy an
:ref:`arbiter <replica-set-arbiters>` in your primary data center.

   :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-geographically-distributed-replica-set`

Non-Production Members
----------------------

In some cases it may be useful to maintain a member that has an always
up-to-date copy of the entire data set but that cannot become primary.
You might create such a member to provide backups, to support reporting
operations, or to act as a cold standby. Such members fall into one or
more of the following categories:

- **Low-Priority**: These members
  have :data:`local.system.replset.members[n].priority` settings such
  that they are either unable to become :term:`primary` or *very*
  unlikely to become primary. In all other respects these low-priority
  members are identical to other replica set member. (See:
  :ref:`replica-set-secondary-only-members`.)

- **Hidden**: These members cannot become primary *and* the set excludes
  them from the output of :method:`db.isMaster()` and from the output of
  the database command :dbcommand:`isMaster`. Excluding hidden members
  from such outputs prevents clients and drivers from using hidden
  members for secondary reads. (See: :ref:`replica-set-hidden-members`.)

- **Voting**: This changes the number of votes that a member of the
  replica set has in elections. In general, use priority to control the
  outcome of elections, as weighting votes introduces operational
  complexities and risks. Only modify the number of votes when you need
  to have more than 7 members in a replica set. (See:
  :ref:`replica-set-non-voting-members`.)

.. note::

   All members of a replica set vote in elections *except* for
   :ref:`non-voting <replica-set-non-voting-members>` members. Priority,
   hidden, or delayed status does not affect a member's ability to vote
   in an election.

Backups
~~~~~~~

For some deployments, keeping a replica set member for dedicated backup
purposes is operationally advantageous. Ensure this member is close,
from a networking perspective, to the primary or likely primary. Ensure
that the :term:`replication lag` is minimal or non-existent. To create a
dedicated :ref:`hidden member <replica-set-hidden-members>` for the
purpose of creating backups.

If this member runs with journaling enabled, you can safely use standard
:doc:`block level backup methods </tutorial/backup-databases-with-filesystem-snapshots>` to create a
backup of this member. Otherwise, if your underlying system does not
support snapshots, you can connect :binary:`~bin.mongodump` to create a
backup directly from the secondary member. In these cases, use the
:option:`--oplog <mongodump --oplog>` option to ensure a consistent
point-in-time dump of the database state.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/administration/backups`.

.. _replica-set-delayed-replication:

Delayed Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:term:`Delayed members <delayed member>` are special :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances in a :term:`replica set` that
apply operations from the :term:`oplog` on a delay to
provide a running "historical" snapshot of the data set, or a rolling
backup. Typically these members provide protection against human error,
such as unintentionally deleted databases and collections or failed
application upgrades or migrations.

Otherwise, delayed member function identically to
:term:`secondary` members, with the following operational differences:
they are not eligible for election to primary and do not receive
secondary queries. Delayed members *do* vote in :term:`elections
<election>` for primary.

See :ref:`Replica Set Delayed Nodes <replica-set-delayed-members>` for
more information about configuring delayed replica set members.

Reporting
~~~~~~~~~

Typically :term:`hidden members <hidden member>` provide a substrate for
reporting purposes, because the replica set segregates these instances
from the cluster. Since no secondary reads reach hidden members, they
receive no traffic beyond what replication requires. While hidden members
are not electable as primary, they are still able to *vote* in elections
for primary. If your operational parameters requires this kind of
reporting functionality, see :ref:`Hidden Replica Set Nodes
<replica-set-hidden-members>` and :data:`local.system.replset.members[n].hidden` for more
information regarding this functionality.

Cold Standbys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For some sets, it may not be possible to initialize a new member in a
reasonable amount of time. In these situations, it may be useful to
maintain a secondary member with an up-to-date copy for the purpose of
replacing another member in the replica set. In most cases, these
members can be ordinary members of the replica set, but in large sets,
with varied hardware availability, or given some patterns of
:ref:`geographical distribution <replica-set-geographical-distribution>`,
you may want to use a member with a different :term:`priority`,
:term:`hidden <hidden member>`, or voting status.

Cold standbys may be valuable when your :term:`primary` and "hot
standby" :term:`secondaries <secondary>` members have a different
hardware specification or connect via a different network than the main
set. In these cases, deploy members with :term:`priority` equal to ``0``
to ensure that they will never become primary. These members will vote in
elections for primary but will never be eligible for election to
primary. Consider likely failover scenarios, such as inter-site network
partitions, and ensure there will be members eligible for election as
primary.

.. note::

   If your set already has ``7`` members, set the
   :data:`local.system.replset.members[n].votes` value to ``0`` for these members, so that
   they won't vote in elections.

.. seealso:: :ref:`Secondary Only <replica-set-secondary-only-members>`,
   and :ref:`Hidden Nodes <replica-set-hidden-members>`.

.. _replica-set-arbiter-nodes:

Arbiters
--------

Deploy an :term:`arbiter` to ensure that a replica set will have
a sufficient number of members to elect a :term:`primary`. While having
replica sets with 2 members is not recommended for production
environments, if you have just two members, deploy an arbiter.
Also, for *any replica set with an even
number of members*, deploy an arbiter.

To deploy an arbiter, see the :ref:`replica-set-arbiters` topic in the
:doc:`/administration/replica-sets` document.
