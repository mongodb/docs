================================
Remove the Backup Agent from MMS
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MMS displays active Backup Agents on the :guilabel:`Agents` page in in the
:guilabel:`Administration` tab. The page displays agents that have been active
in the last 24 hours. If an agent fails to report to MMS for more than 24
hours, MMS removes the agent from the :guilabel:`Agents` page.

To remove a Backup Agent from MMS, :ref:`stop the agent's process
<stop-backup-agent>` and then wait 24 hours.

To delete an agent from a Linux or OSX server, :ref:`first stop the agent's
process <stop-backup-agent>`, and then remove the ``mongodb-mms-backup-agent``
file from the directory to which it was installed.
