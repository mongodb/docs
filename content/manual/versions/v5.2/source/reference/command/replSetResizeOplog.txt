.. dbcommand:: replSetResizeOplog

   .. versionadded:: 4.4

      :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` also supports specifying the 
      minimum number of hours to preserve an oplog entry.

   .. versionchanged:: 5.0

      To set the ``replSetOplog`` size in :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, use
      the ``Double()`` constructor. 

   :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` enables you to resize the oplog or
   its minimum retention period dynamically without restarting the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` process. 

   You must run this command against the ``admin`` database.

   The command has the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand(
        { 
          replSetResizeOplog: <int>, 
          size: <double>, 
          minRetentionHours: <double>
        }
      )

   :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` takes the following fields:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Field
   
        - Type
   
        - Description

      * - ``replSetResizeOplog``
        
        - int
        
        - Set to ``1``. 

      * - ``size``
        
        - double

        - The maximum size of the oplog in megabytes.

          - The minimum size you can specify is 990 megabytes.

          - The maximum size you can specify is 1 petabytes.

          - Explicitly cast the ``size`` as a double in
            :binary:`~bin.mongosh` with ``Double()``. See
            :ref:`oplog-ex-change-size`.

      * - :ref:`minRetentionHours <replSetResizeOplog-minRetentionHours>`

        - double

        - .. _replSetResizeOplog-minRetentionHours:

          *Optional*. The minimum number of hours to preserve an oplog
          entry, where decimal values represent the fractions of an
          hour. For example, a value of ``1.5`` represents one hour and
          thirty minutes.

          The value must be greater than or equal to ``0``. A value of
          ``0`` indicates that the :binary:`~bin.mongod` should
          truncate the oplog starting with the oldest entries to
          maintain the configured maximum oplog size.

          A :binary:`~bin.mongod` configured with
          ``minRetentionHours`` only removes an oplog entry *if*:

          - The oplog has reached the maximum configured size, *and* 

          - The oplog entry is older that the configured number of 
            hours based on the host system clock.

          To check the currently configured minimum oplog retention
          period, see the
          :serverstatus:`oplogTruncation.minRetentionHours` in the
          output of the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command.

          .. versionadded:: 4.4

.. seealso::

   - :option:`--oplogSize <mongod --oplogSize>` / :setting:`replication.oplogSizeMB`
   - :option:`--oplogMinRetentionHours <mongod --oplogMinRetentionHours>` / :setting:`storage.oplogMinRetentionHours`


Behavior
--------

You can only use :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` on 
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instances running with the 
:ref:`Wired Tiger storage engine <storage-wiredtiger>`. 

See the :ref:`tutorial-change-oplog-size` tutorial for a procedure
on using :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` command to resize the oplog.

.. include:: /includes/fact-oplog-size.rst

Starting in MongoDB 4.0, MongoDB forbids dropping the ``local.oplog.rs``
collection. For more information on this restriction, see
:ref:`oplog-coll-behavior`.

:dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` overrides the maximum oplog size or
minimum oplog retention period set at startup by:

- :setting:`replication.oplogSizeMB` / :option:`--oplogSizeMB <mongod
  --oplogSize>`, and

- :setting:`storage.oplogMinRetentionHours` /
  :option:`--oplogMinRetentionHours <mongod --oplogMinRetentionHours>`
  respectively.

The new oplog size persists after a server restart, unless
you use:

- :setting:`storage.oplogMinRetentionHours`, or

- :option:`--oplogMinRetentionHours <mongod --oplogMinRetentionHours>`.

.. important::

   Reducing the maximum oplog size results in truncation of the oldest
   oplog entries until the oplog reaches the new configured size.
   
   Similarly, reducing the minimum oplog retention period (*new in 4.4*)
   results in truncation of oplog entries older that the specified
   period *if* the oplog has exceeded the maximum configured size.

   Oplog truncation due to reduced oplog size or retention period can
   result in unexpected behavior from clients still reading those oplog
   entries, including:

   - Open :ref:`change streams <changeStreams>` may become 
     invalidated

   - Secondaries which have not replicated those oplog entries
     may require :ref:`resynchronization <replica-set-initial-sync>`.

   - Backups using :binary:`~bin.mongodump` with 
     :option:`--oplog <mongodump.--oplog>` against the member may
     not capture entries prior to truncation.

.. _replSetResizeOplog-cmd-minimum-retention:

Minimum Oplog Retention Period
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :binary:`~bin.mongod` has the following behavior when configured with
a minimum oplog retention period (*New in 4.4*):

- The oplog can grow without constraint so as to retain oplog entries
  for the configured number of hours. This may result in reduction or
  exhaustion of system disk space due to a combination of high write
  volume and large retention period.

- If the oplog grows beyond its maximum size, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` 
  may continue to hold that disk space even if the oplog returns to its
  maximum size *or* is configured for a smaller maximum size. See
  :ref:`replSetResizeOplog-cmd-compact`.

- The :binary:`~bin.mongod` compares the system wall clock to an 
  oplog entries creation wall clock time when enforcing oplog entry
  retention. Clock drift between cluster components may result in
  unexpected oplog retention behavior. See
  :ref:`production-notes-clock-synchronization` for more information on
  clock synchronization across cluster members.

``replSetResizeOplog`` Does Not Replicate To Other Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changing the oplog size or minimum oplog retention period (*new in 4.4*)
of a given replica set member with :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` does
not change the oplog size of any other member in the replica set. You
must run :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` on each replica set member in
your cluster to change the oplog size or minimum retention period for
all members.

.. _replSetResizeOplog-cmd-compact:

Reducing Oplog Size Does Not Immediately Return Disk Space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reducing the oplog size does not immediately reclaim that disk space.
This includes oplog size reduction due to truncation of oplog events
older than of the :ref:`minimum oplog retention period
<replSetResizeOplog-cmd-minimum-retention>` (*New in 4.4*).

To immediately free unused disk space after reducing the oplog size, run
:dbcommand:`compact` against the ``oplog.rs`` collection in the
``local`` database during a maintenance period. ``compact`` blocks all
operations on the database it runs against. Running ``compact`` against
``oplog.rs`` therefore prevents oplog synchronization. For a procedure
on resizing the oplog and compacting ``oplog.rs``, see
:doc:`/tutorial/change-oplog-size`.

Resource Locking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 4.2.2

- For MongoDB 4.2.2 and later, :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` takes
  an exclusive (W) lock on the :data:`oplog <local.oplog.rs>`
  and blocks other operations on the collection until it finishes.

- For MongoDB 4.2.1 and earlier, :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` 
  takes a global exclusive (W) lock and blocks all other operations
  until it finishes.

For more information on locking in MongoDB, see :doc:`/faq/concurrency`.

Examples
--------

.. _oplog-ex-change-size:

Change the Maximum Oplog Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the :method:`db.collection.stats()` :binary:`~bin.mongosh`
method to display the current maximum oplog size, ``maxSize``, in
megabytes. For example:
         
.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("local").oplog.rs.stats(1024*1024).maxSize

The above command returns the oplog size of this member in megabytes:

.. code-block:: javascript

   990

The following command uses :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` to change the
oplog size of this member to 16384 megabytes:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({ "replSetResizeOplog": 1, size: Double(16384)})

To verify the new oplog size, rerun the :method:`db.collection.stats()` method:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("local").oplog.rs.stats(1024*1024).maxSize

The above command returns:

.. code-block:: javascript

   "maxSize": NumberLong("16834")

.. warning::

   Reducing the size of the oplog in a node removes data from it. This
   may cause replica members syncing with that node to become stale.
   To resync those members, see :doc:`/tutorial/resync-replica-set-member`.


Change the Minimum Oplog Retention Period
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   replica set member.

#. *Optional*. Use the :method:`db.serverStatus()` command to verify
   the current minimum oplog retention value as
   :serverstatus:`oplogTruncation.minRetentionHours`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getSiblingDB("admin").serverStatus().oplogTruncation.minRetentionHours

   The command returns the currently configured minimum oplog retention
   period for the :binary:`~bin.mongod`. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      1.5

   If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` has no minimum oplog retention period,
   the operation returns an empty result.

#. Use the :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` command to modify the
   configured minimum oplog retention period. For example, the following
   sets the minimum oplog retention period to ``2`` hours:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand({
        "replSetResizeOplog" : 1, 
        "minRetentionHours" : 2
      })
