  The |odbc-driver-name| files are named ``libmdbodbca.so`` and
  ``libmdbodbcw.so``. After downloading the |odbc-driver-name|,
  move them to your ``/usr/local/lib`` directory.

title: Create an ``odbc.ini`` file
ref: create-odbc-ini
level: 4
content: |
  The file ``/etc/odbc.ini`` defines your Data Source Names. Below is
  an example ``odbc.ini`` file which is configured to use the
  |odbc-driver-name| with a DSN called ``MongoDBODBC``. Replace all
  necessary placeholder values with values for your system.

  The file named ``libmdbodbca.so`` is the ANSI driver, and the
  file named ``libmdbodbcw.so`` is the Unicode driver. Specify the
  desired driver by setting the ``Driver`` parameter in your
  ``odbc.ini`` file.

  .. include:: /includes/fact-ansi-unicode-driver.rst

  .. code-block:: none

     [MongoDBODBC]
     Description = ODBC for MongoDB BI Connector
     Driver      = /usr/local/lib/<libmdbodbca.so|libmdbodbcw.so>
     Trace       = Off
     TraceFile   = stderr
     ReadOnly    = yes
     SERVER      = <server address>
     PORT        = 3307
     USER        = <username>
     PASSWORD    = <password>
     DATABASE    = <dbname>

title: Test with iusql
ref: test-with-iusql
level: 4
content: |
  The ``unixODBC`` package includes an SQL client called ``iusql``. You
  can use it to test your DSN.

  The following example uses ``iusql`` to connect to the
  ``MongoDBODBC`` DSN:

  .. code-block:: shell
     :copyable: false

     > iusql -v MongoDBODBC

     SQL> use test;

     SQL> show tables;
...
