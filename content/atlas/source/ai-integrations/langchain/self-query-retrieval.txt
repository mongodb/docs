    NOTE: If you edit any of the code on this page, also update the Jupyter Notebook
    at https://github.com/mongodb/docs-notebooks/blob/main/ai-integrations/langchain-self-query-retriever.ipynb

You can integrate {+avs+} with LangChain to perform 
:ref:`self-querying retrieval <self-querying-retrieval>`.
This tutorial demonstrates how to use the self-querying retriever
to run natural language {+avs+} queries with metadata filtering.

Self-querying retrieval uses an LLM to process your search query 
to identify possible metadata filters, forms a structured vector 
search query with the filters, and then runs the query to retrieve 
the most relevant documents.

.. example::

   With a query like "What are thriller movies from after 2010 with
   ratings above 8?", the retriever can identify filters on the ``genre``, 
   ``year``, and ``rating`` fields, and use those filters to retrieve documents
   that match the query.

Prerequisites
-------------

To complete this tutorial, you must have the following:

- .. include:: /includes/avs/shared/avs-requirements-cluster.rst
- A Voyage AI API key. To learn more, see `Voyage AI Documentation <https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/api-key-and-installation>`__.
- .. include:: /includes/avs/shared/avs-requirements-openai-api-key.rst

Use MongoDB as a Vector Store
-----------------------------

In this section, you create a vector store instance
using your MongoDB cluster as a vector database.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Set up the environment.

      .. include:: /includes/avs/shared/set-up-python-notebook-environment.rst
      
      a. Run the following command in your notebook:

         .. code-block:: shell

            pip install --quiet --upgrade langchain-mongodb langchain-voyageai langchain-openai langchain langchain-core lark

      #. Set environment variables.

         Run the following code to set the environment variables for this tutorial.
         Provide your Voyage API key, OpenAI API Key, and MongoDB cluster's
         |srv| :manual:`connection string
         </reference/connection-string/#find-your-mongodb-atlas-connection-string>`.

         .. code-block:: python

            import os

            os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<openai-key>"
            os.environ["VOYAGE_API_KEY"] = "<voyage-key>"
            MONGODB_URI = "<connection-string>"

         .. note:: 

            .. include:: /includes/search-shared/find-connection-string.rst

   .. step:: Instantiate the vector store.

      Run the following code in your notebook 
      to create a vector store instance
      named ``vector_store`` using the ``langchain_db.self_query``
      namespace in MongoDB:

      .. code-block:: python

         from langchain_mongodb import MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch
         from langchain_voyageai import VoyageAIEmbeddings

         # Use the voyage-3-large embedding model
         embedding_model = VoyageAIEmbeddings(model="voyage-3-large")

         # Create the vector store
         vector_store = MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch.from_connection_string(
            connection_string = MONGODB_URI,
            embedding = embedding_model,
            namespace = "langchain_db.self_query",
            text_key = "page_content"
         )

   .. step:: Add data to the vector store.

      Paste and run the following code in your notebook 
      to ingest some sample documents with metadata into 
      your collection in MongoDB.

      .. code-block:: python

         from langchain_core.documents import Document

         docs = [
             Document(
                 page_content="A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose",
                 metadata={"year": 1993, "rating": 7.7, "genre": "action"},
             ),
             Document(
                 page_content="A fight club that is not a fight club, but is a fight club",
                 metadata={"year": 1994, "rating": 8.7, "genre": "action"},
             ),
             Document(
                 page_content="Leo DiCaprio gets lost in a dream within a dream within a dream within a ...",
                 metadata={"year": 2010, "genre": "thriller", "rating": 8.2},
             ),
             Document(
                 page_content="A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them",
                 metadata={"year": 2019, "rating": 8.3, "genre": "drama"},
             ),
             Document(
                 page_content="Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone",
                 metadata={"year": 1979, "rating": 9.9, "genre": "science fiction"},
             ),
             Document(
                 page_content="A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea",
                 metadata={"year": 2006, "genre": "thriller", "rating": 9.0},
             ),
             Document(
                 page_content="Toys come alive and have a blast doing so",
                 metadata={"year": 1995, "genre": "animated", "rating": 9.3},
             ),
             Document(
                 page_content="The toys come together to save their friend from a kid who doesn't know how to play with them",
                 metadata={"year": 1997, "genre": "animated", "rating": 9.1},
             ),
         ]

         # Add data to the vector store, which automaticaly embeds the documents
         vector_store.add_documents(docs)

      If you're using |service|, you can verify your vector embeddings
      by navigating to the ``langchain_db.self_query`` namespace
      :ref:`in the {+atlas-ui+} <atlas-ui-view-collections>`.

   .. step:: Create the {+avs+} index with filters.

      Run the following code to create the {+avs+} index with filters 
      for the vector store to enable vector search and metadata filtering 
      over your data:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/ai-integrations/langchain/self-query/create-vector-search-index.py
         :language: python
         :copyable:

      .. tip::

         `create_vector_search_index API reference <https://langchain-mongodb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/langchain_mongodb/index/langchain_mongodb.index.create_vector_search_index.html>`__

      .. include:: /includes/search-shared/fact-index-build-initial-sync.rst

Create the Self-Querying Retriever
----------------------------------

In this section, you initialize the self-querying retriever
to query data from your vector store.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Describe the documents and metadata fields.
      
      To use the self-querying retriever, you must describe the 
      documents in your collection and the metadata fields that you want to filter on.
      This information helps the LLM understand the structure of your data
      and how to filter results based on user queries.

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/ai-integrations/langchain/self-query/describe-documents-metadata.py
         :language: python
         :copyable:
         
   .. step:: Initialize the self-querying retriever.
    
      Run the following code to create a self-querying retriever
      using the ``MongoDBAtlasSelfQueryRetriever.from_llm`` method.
      
      .. literalinclude:: /includes/ai-integrations/langchain/self-query/initialize-self-querying-retriever.py
         :language: python
         :copyable:

      .. tip::

         `MongoDBAtlasSelfQueryRetriever API Reference <https://langchain-mongodb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/langchain_mongodb/retrievers/langchain_mongodb.retrievers.self_querying.MongoDBAtlasSelfQueryRetriever.html>`__

Run Queries with the Self-Querying Retriever
--------------------------------------------

Run the following queries to see how the self-querying retriever 
executes different types of queries:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Query with filters
      :tabid: with-filters

Use the Retriever in Your RAG Pipeline
--------------------------------------

You can use the self-querying retriever in your RAG pipeline. 
Paste and run the following code in your notebook to implement 
a sample RAG pipeline that performs self-querying retrieval.

This code also configures the retriever to use the ``enable_limit`` parameter,
which allows the LLM to limit the number of documents returned by the retriever
if necessary. The generated response might vary.

      Question: What are two movies about toys after 1990?
      Answer: The two movies about toys after 1990 are:  

      1. The 1995 animated movie (rated 9.3) where toys come alive and have fun.  
      2. The 1997 animated movie (rated 9.1) where toys work together to save their friend from a kid who doesn’t know how to play with them.
