msgid "Aggregations operations process data records and return computed results. Aggregation operations group values from multiple documents together, and can perform a variety of operations on the grouped data to return a single result. MongoDB provides three ways to perform aggregation: the :doc:`aggregation pipeline </core/aggregation-pipeline>`, the :doc:`map-reduce function </core/map-reduce>`, and :doc:`single purpose aggregation methods and commands </core/single-purpose-aggregation>`."

Using this framework, MongoDB passes the documents of a single collection through a pipeline. The pipeline transforms the documents into aggregated results, and is accessed through the :dbcommand:`aggregate` database command."
