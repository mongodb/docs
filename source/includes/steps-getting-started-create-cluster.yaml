  Selecting :guilabel:`M0` automatically locks the remaining configuration
  options.
  
  If you do not see the :guilabel:`M0` instance size, ensure that the
  :guilabel:`Cloud Provider and Region` dropdowns have ``Amazon Web Services``
  and ``N. Virginia (us-east-1)`` selected.

title: "Create an administrative Username and Password."
level: 4
ref: create-cluster-user
content: |

  |service| prompts you to create an administrative MongoDB user as a part of
  deploying the first |service| cluster in the project. This user has
  administrative access to any MongoDB cluster you deploy in the |service|
  project.
  
  Fill in the :guilabel:`username` and :guilabel:`password` fields. 
  The password should be random, long, and complex to ensure system security
  and to impede malicious access.
  
  For more information on |service| user security, see :ref:`mongodb-users`.

  Once |service| finishes creating your Free Tier cluster, click the
  :guilabel:`Connect` button for the cluster. From the :guilabel:`Connect`
  dialog, do the following:
    
  a. Add your current IP address to the :ref:`security-ip-whitelist` by
     clicking :guilabel:`Add Current IP Address`. This allows you to connect
     to the cluster from your current machine.
     
     If you want to connect from a different machine, click 
     :guilabel:`Add Entry` and input the specific IP address for that machine.
     
  #. Select :guilabel:`Connect with the Mongo Shell`. 
  
     The :guilabel:`Connect` dialog displays operating system-specific
     instructions for downloading the :program:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell.
     Follow the instructions in the :guilabel:`Connect` dialog to download and
     install the shell.
     
  #. Connect with the :program:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell by following the
     remaining instructions in the :guilabel:`Connect` dialog. You will need
     the password for the administrative user you created when configuring the
     Free Tier cluster.
     
  #. Insert a document into the ``test.foo`` collection:
     
     .. class:: copyable-code
     .. code-block:: javascript
     
         db.getSiblingDB("test").getCollection("foo").insert( { "msg" : "My First Document" } )
  
  #. Find all documents in the ``test.foo`` collection:
    
     .. class:: copyable-code
     .. code-block:: javascript
     
        db.getSiblingDB("test").getCollection("foo").find()
  
  Once you have confirmed your cluster is available and accessible, continue
  to the following section.
