  MongoDB is compatible with {{software}}.

  {{software}} supports *memory overcommitment*, where you can assign more memory
  to your virtual machines than the physical machine has available. When
  memory is overcommitted, the hypervisor reallocates memory between the
  virtual machines. {{software}}'s balloon driver {{balloonDriverLiteral}} reclaims the
  pages that are considered least valuable. The balloon driver resides
  inside the guest operating system. When the balloon driver expands,
  it may induce the guest operating system to reclaim memory from guest
  applications, which can interfere with MongoDB's memory management and
  affect MongoDB's performance.

  You can disable the balloon driver and {{software}}'s memory overcommitment
  feature to mitigate these problems. However, disabling the balloon driver
  can cause the hypervisor to use its swap, as there is no other available
  mechanism to perform the memory reclamation. Accessing data in swap
  is much slower than accessing data in memory, which can in turn affect
  performance. Instead of disabling the balloon driver and memory
  overcommitment features, map and reserve the full amount of memory for
  the virtual machine running MongoDB. This ensures that the balloon
  will not be inflated in the local operating system if there is memory
  pressure in the hypervisor due to an overcommitted configuration.

  When using MongoDB with {{software}}, ensure that the CPU reservation does not
  exceed more than 2 virtual CPUs per physical core.
