Calculate New Data Fields

You can combine data from one or more fields in your collection into
a single calculated field. For example, you can:

- Convert a field in hours to seconds or in degrees Farenheit to Celsius
- Multiply a price field by a quantity field to create a total
- Combine multiple line items within an array to calculate a total 

Considerations
--------------

- You can only create calculated fields from data within the same
  document.
- You can't :ref:`convert the type <convert-field-data-types>` of a
  calculated field through the |charts| interface. However, you can use
  :manual:`Type Expression Operators
  </meta/aggregation-quick-reference/#type-expression-operators>` in a
  calculated field's definition.
- Once you create a calculated field, you can :ref:`modify
  <edit-calculated-field>` its definition but not its name. However, you
  can :ref:`remove <remove-calculated-field>` and recreate the field if
  you need to rename it.

Create a Calculated Field
-------------------------

You create a calculated field by combining the data of existing fields
through simple expressions or :abbr:`MQL (MongoDB Query Language)`
:ref:`agg-quick-ref-operator-expressions`.

.. note::

   The definition of a calculated field can contain either simple
   expression language or operator expression language. You can't use 
   both simple and operator expression language in the same definition.

To create a calculated field:

1. In the corner of the :guilabel:`Fields` pane, click
   :icon-fa5:`plus`:guilabel:`Add Field`.

#. Select :guilabel:`Calculated`.

#. Enter the :guilabel:`Field Name` of the calculated field you want to
   define. You can specify a nested field by using dot notation. For
   example, ``metadata.target``.

#. Enter the :guilabel:`Value Expression` using :ref:`simple expression
   <calc-field-simple>` language or
   :ref:`agg-quick-ref-operator-expressions`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save Field`.

The calculated field appears in italics in the :guilabel:`Fields` pane.

Simple Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the following simple expression language in a calculated
field.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Expression Language
     - Example

   * - Field names
     - | ``orderTotal``
       | ``'orderTotal'``
       | ``"orderTotal"``
   
   * - Literal numbers
     - | ``2``
       | ``0.5``
   
   * - Mathematical operators
     - | ``+``
       | ``-``
       | ``*``
       | ``/``

   * - Brackets
     - ``( )``

Whitespace that is outside of quoted strings is not included in the 
expression.

.. example::

   The following examples are valid simple expressions to define a
   calculated field.

   Add the ``bathrooms`` field to the ``bedrooms`` field:

   .. code-block:: json

      bathrooms + bedrooms

   Multiply the ``total amount`` field by 1.1:

   .. code-block:: json

      'total amount' * 1.1

   Subtract ``32`` from the ``sensor.temp`` field, then multiply by
   ``5`` and divide by ``9``:

   .. code-block:: json
      
      (sensor.temp - 32)*5/9

.. _calc-field-mql:

Operator Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use :ref:`agg-quick-ref-operator-expressions` to define more
complex calculated fields.

.. example::

   The following examples are valid operator expressions to define a
   calculated field.

   Multiply the ``price`` field by ``0.075``:

   .. code-block:: json

      { $multiply: [ "$price", 0.075 ] }

   Combine multiple line items fields in an array to calculate a 
   total:

   .. code-block:: json

      { $reduce: {
        input: '$items', initialValue: 0,
        in: { $sum : ["$$value",
          { $multiply: ["$$this.price", 
            "$$this.quantity"] }
        ] } } }

.. tip::
   
   You can use a calculated field in the definition of another
   calculated field.

   For example, if you create a ``salesTax`` calculated field with the
   following definition:

   .. code-block:: json
   
      { $multiply: [ "$price", 0.075 ] }

   You can then create a ``totalCost`` calculated field that uses the
   ``salesTax`` field in its definition:

   .. code-block:: json

      { $sum: ["$price", "$salesTax"] }

Literal Strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set a calculated field's value to a string using the ``$literal``
operator.

.. example::
   
   The following field definition assigns a value of ``my string``:

   .. code-block:: json

      { $literal: "my string" }

.. _edit-calculated-field:

Edit a Calculated Field
-----------------------

You can modify the definition of a calculated field.

1. In the :guilabel:`Fields` pane, click the :guilabel:`Ellipsis (...)`
   next to the name of the calculated field you want to modify.

#. Select :guilabel:`Modify field`.

#. Update the :guilabel:`Value Expression`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save Field`.

If you are using the calculated field in a chart, the chart refreshes to
reflect the new calculated field definition.

.. figure:: /images/charts/calculated-field-modify.png
   :figwidth: 50%
   :alt: Click the ellipsis next to the field name, then click "Modify field".
   
.. _remove-calculated-field:

Remove a Calculated Field
-------------------------

When you remove a calculated field, |charts| resamples the data source,
updates the :guilabel:`Fields` pane, and refreshes your chart. If the
calculated field was used in encodings or filters, it remains in the
chart even after the field is removed from the :guilabel:`Fields` pane.

To remove a calculated field:

1. In the :guilabel:`Fields` pane, click the :guilabel:`Ellipsis (...)`
   next to the name of the calculated field you want to remove.

#. Select :guilabel:`Remove field`.

.. figure:: /images/charts/calculated-field-remove.png
   :figwidth: 50%
   :alt: Click the ellipsis next to the field name, then click "Remove field".
