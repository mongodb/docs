You can migrate data from your on-premises MongoDB deployments to |service| using one of 
a variety of methods designed to transfer your data securely, accurately, and 
efficiently, with minimal cutover time. We recommend using |service| live migration 
when possible because it automates the most tasks with the least downtime, but you can use 
more :ref:`manual methods <arch-center-manual-migration>`
that accommodate the variety and complexity inherent to database migration. 

Live Migration Overview
----------------------- 

|service| live migration automates moving data from on-premises MongoDB databases to |service|.
You can pull data from an on-premises MongoDB database or push data using |com|, 
but with either method, |service| live migration includes the following features:

- The migration host always encrypts traffic to the |service| {+cluster+}. To encrypt 
  data end-to-end, :manual:`enable TLS on your source {+cluster+} </tutorial/upgrade-cluster-to-ssl/>`. Only users with specific 
  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) :ref:`roles <authorization>` 
  (such as :authrole:`backup`, :authrole:`readAnyDatabase`, or :authrole:`clusterMonitor`) 
  can initiate live migration. Users authenticate to {+clusters+} using 
  :manual:`SCRAM-SHA-1 or SCRAM-SHA-256 </core/security-scram/>`.

- Live migration automates most tasks. You specify the resource requirements 
  and scalable options to prevent over-provisioning.

- Detailed instructions help you provision migration hosts and scale destination {+clusters+} 
  to control costs. Recommendations include appropriate {+cluster+} sizing 
  and temporary scaling, followed by resizing to optimal levels post-migration.

- Live migration uses |mongosync| to facilitate fast cutover through parallel data copying.
  Processes manage temporary network interruptions and {+cluster+} elections, using continuous 
  data synchronization and a final cutover phase to achieve minimal downtime. Retry 
  mechanisms and pre-migration validations enhance resilience against interruptions.

- Monitor migrations with real-time status updates and notifications.

Live Migration Methods
----------------------

You can use |com| to push data into |service| or use a live migration server 
to pull data into |service|.

Ensure you allocate adequate |cpu| and network resources for the migration host. 
While you can run multiple concurrent migrations, each deployment must have a 
dedicated migration host.

Both live migration methods require that the source and destination databases run 
MongoDB 6.0.13+ or MongoDB 7.0.8+. To migrate data from databases using prior 
versions of MongoDB, see `Legacy Migration <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/legacy-migration/>`__ or :ref:`arch-center-manual-migration`. 

* **Pull data into Atlas.** |service| pulls data from the source MongoDB deployment 
  and requires access to the source deployment through the deployment's firewall. When the 
  {+clusters+} are nearly synced, you must stop write operations on the source, 
  redirect applications to the |service| {+cluster+} and restart them. The following
  considerations apply:

  - Best for deployments not monitored by |com|. 
  - The source database must be publicly accessible to allow inbound access from the live migration server.
  - Doesn't support :ref:`VPC peering <vpc-peering>` or :ref:`private endpoints <private-endpoint>`
    for either the source or destination {+cluster+}.
  - Source and destination {+cluster+} topologies must match. For example, both 
    must be replica sets or sharded clusters with the same number of shards.
  - Plan for minimal downtime to stop writes and restart applications with a new connection string.  

  For full migration recommendations and instructions, see :ref:`c2c-pull-live-migration`.

* **Push data into Atlas.** |com| push data to |service| using a secure :term:`link-token` 
  without requiring access to the source {+cluster+} through the {+cluster+}'s firewall.
  During migration, |service| continuously syncs real-time data between the source 
  and destination {+clusters+} until cutover. The following
  considerations apply:
  
  - Data is synchronized in one direction only: changes made to the destination won't 
    reflect back on the source.
  - Supports :ref:`VPC peering <vpc-peering>` and :ref:`private endpoints <private-endpoint>`.
  - Source and destination {+cluster+} topologies must match. For example, both 
    must be replica sets or sharded clusters with the same number of shards.

Manual Migration Methods
------------------------

If |service| live migration can't satisfy the constraints of your migration requirements, 
you can bring data from existing MongoDB deployments, ``JSON``, or ``CSV`` files
into |service| using one of the following tools that you run outside of |service|.
