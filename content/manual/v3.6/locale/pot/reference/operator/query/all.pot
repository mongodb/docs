msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/operator/query/all.txt:51
msgid "When passed an array of a nested array (e.g. ``[ [ \"A\" ] ]`` ), :query:`$all` can now match documents where the field contains the nested array as an element (e.g. ``field: [ [ \"A\" ], ... ]``), *or* the field equals the nested array (e.g. ``field: [ \"A\" ]``)."

#: ../source/reference/operator/query/all.txt:74
msgid "As such, the :query:`$all` expression can match documents where the ``tags`` field is an array that contains the nested array ``[ \"ssl\", \"security\" ]`` or is an array that equals the nested array:"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/operator/query/all.txt:83
msgid "This behavior for :query:`$all` allows for more matches than previous versions of MongoDB. Earlier versions could only match documents where the field contains the nested array."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/operator/query/all.txt:88
msgid "The :query:`$all` expression with a *single* element is for illustrative purposes since the :query:`$all` expression is unnecessary if matching only a single element. Instead, when matching a single element, a \"contains\" expression (i.e. ``arrayField: element`` ) is more suitable."
