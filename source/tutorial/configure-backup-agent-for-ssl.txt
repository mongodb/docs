==============================
Configure Backup Agent for SSL
==============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

If your MongoDB deployment uses SSL, then you must configure the Backup
Agent to use SSL to connect to your deployment's :program:`mongod` and
:program:`mongos` instances.

Configuring the agent to use SSL involves specifying which certificate to
use to sign MongoDB certificates and turning on the SSL option for the
MongoDB instances in |mms|.

Prerequisite
------------

To configure the agent to use SSL, you must have a trusted CA
certificate that signed the MongoDB instance's certificate.

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/steps/backup-agent-configure-ssl.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-ssl-host-settings.rst

Connections between Agents and |mms| Servers
--------------------------------------------

.. only:: classic or cloud

   The Backup Agents always use SSL when connecting to the |mms|
   servers.

.. only:: onprem

   To ensure that the Backup Agents use SSL when connecting
   to the |mms| servers, use an HTTPS proxy in front of |mms|.

   SSL Certificate Validation
   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   Starting with |mms| 1.4, the Backup Agent validates the SSL
   certificate of the |mms| server by default.

   If you are not using a certificate signed by a trusted 3rd party,
   you must configure the Backup Agent to trust the |mms| server.

   To specify a self-signed certificate of the |mms| server that the
   Backup Agent should trust:

   .. include:: /includes/steps/on-prem-backup-agent-configure-trust.rst

   Configuration Settings
   ++++++++++++++++++++++

For the settings used by the Backup Agent to connect to the |mms|
servers, see :ref:`backup-server-ssl-settings`.

Additional Information
----------------------

For information about MongoDB and SSL, see
:manual:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.

You can also configure the backup agent to use x509 client
authentication see :bsetting:`sslClientcertificate` and the other
:ref:`backup-mongodb-ssl-settings`.
