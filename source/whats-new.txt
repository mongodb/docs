Types of Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New versions of the {+driver-short+} can introduce the following types of breaking changes:

- **API** changes concern the API of the {+driver-short+} libraries. These changes are
  accompanied by an API major version bump. You might need to edit C++ source code
  in your project to address these changes.

  .. example::

     - Removes the declaration of function ``v1::func()``. (The definition is still provided for ABI compatibility.)
     - Removes the inline function ``v_noabi::func()``.
     - Removes ``v_noabi::func()``.
     - Changes the redeclaration of ``bsoncxx::foo`` from ``v1::foo`` to ``v2::foo``.
       To continue using the old interface, qualify ``bsoncxx::foo`` as ``bsoncxx::v1::foo``.

- **ABI** changes concern the ABI of the {+driver-short+} libraries. These changes are
  accompanied by an ABI version bump, and may also be accompanied by an API major version
  bump. You might need to rebuild your project or edit your C++ source code to address
  these changes.

  ABI stability is **not** supported for symbols corresponding to entities declared in
  the ``v_noabi`` namespace. Breaking changes for such symbols are not necessarily
  accompanied by an ABI version bump.

  .. example::

     - Removes the exported symbol ``v_noabi::func()``.
     - Removes the exported symbol ``v1::func()``.
     - Removes the exported symbols for ``v1::type``.

- **Build system** changes concern the build system or packaging of the {+driver-short+}
  libraries. These changes are not necessarily accompanied by either an API major version
  bump or an ABI version bump.
  To address these changes, you might need to modify your build system configurations or
  update your project's package or dependency management settings. You might also need to
  modify or rebuild your C++ source code.

  .. example::

     - Removes the ``ENABLE_FOO`` configuration variable.
     - Changes the default value of the ``ENABLE_BAR`` configuration variable from
       ``OFF`` to ``ON``.
     - Drops support for platform A, compiler B, or architecture C.

.. _version-3.11:

What's New in 3.11
------------------

.. warning:: Breaking Changes

   The v3.11 driver introduces the following breaking changes:
   
   - Drops support for {+mdb-server+} v3.6.
   - Requires MongoDB C Driver v1.28.0 or later.
   - Removes export of the following private member functions in the bsoncxx
     ABI:
   
     - ``bsoncxx::v_noabi::types::bson_value::value::value(const uint8_t*, uint32_t, uint32_t, uint32_t)``
     - ``bsoncxx::v_noabi::types::bson_value::view::_init(void*)``
     - ``bsoncxx::v_noabi::types::bson_value::view::view(const uint8_t*, uint32_t, uint32_t, uint32_t)``
     - ``bsoncxx::v_noabi::types::bson_value::view::view(void*)``

   - Removes export of the following private member functions in the mongocxx
     ABI:
   
     - ``mongocxx::v_noabi::options::change_stream::as_bson()``
     - ``mongocxx::v_noabi::options::aggregate::append(bsoncxx::v_noabi::builder::basic::document&)``
     - ``mongocxx::v_noabi::options::index::storage_options()``
   
   - Declare all exported functions symbols with ``__cdecl`` when compiled with
     MSVC. This is an ABI breaking change if you use an alternative
     default calling convention when building projects.

The v3.11 driver release includes the following new features:

- Adds support for {+mdb-server+} v8.0.
- Adds support for Queryable Encryption range queries. To use this
  feature, your app must connect to {+mdb-server+} 8.0 or later. For
  more information about Queryable Encryption, see :manual:`Queryable
  Encryption </core/queryable-encryption>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
- Adds ``empty()`` member function for ``mongocxx::v_noabi::bulk_write``.

`v3.11 Release Notes <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/releases/tag/r3.11.0>`__

.. _version-3.10:

What's New in 3.10
------------------

.. warning:: Build System Breaking Changes

   The v3.10 driver introduces the following breaking changes to the build system:
   
   - Drops support for calling ``find_package(libbsoncxx)`` and ``find_package(libmongocxx)``.
     Use ``find_package(bsoncxx)`` and ``find_package(mongocxx)``
     instead.
   - Drops support for the ``LIBBSONCXX_*`` and ``LIBMONGOCXX_*`` CMake variables
     provided by the legacy CMake package config files. Use the ``mongo::bsoncxx_*`` and
     ``mongo::mongocxx_*`` CMake targets instead.
   - Removes the ``BSONCXX_POLY_USE_STD_EXPERIMENTAL`` CMake option and drops support for selecting the experimental C++ standard library as a polyfill option.

The v3.10.0 driver release includes the following new features:

- Adds forward headers that provide non-defining declarations of ``bsoncxx`` and
  ``mongocxx`` class types. The driver does not support user-defined forward declarations
  of any library entity. To obtain the declaration or definition of a library entity,
  always include the corresponding header.
- The CMake option ``ENABLE_BSONCXX_USE_POLY_IMPLS`` allows selecting
  ``bsoncxx`` implementations of C++17 polyfills by default when no polyfill library is
  requested. This option is ``OFF`` by default.
- The CMake option ``BSONCXX_POLY_USE_IMPLS`` allows selecting ``bsoncxx`` implementations
  of C++17 polyfills instead of external libraries or the C++ standard library. This
  option is ``OFF`` by default.
- The ``bsoncxx::v_noabi`` and ``mongocxx::v_noabi`` namespaces are no longer declared inline.
  Root namespace declarations are still supported and expected to remain equivalent to
  their prior definitions. For example, ``bsoncxx::document`` is still equivalent to
  ``bsoncxx::v_noabi::document``, and ``mongocxx::client`` is still equivalent to
  ``mongocxx::v_noabi::client``.
- By default, when library filenames are compiled with MSVC (as detected by CMake's ``MSVC``
  variable), they are embedded with an ABI tag string. These strings are similar to
  the following:
  
  .. code-block:: bash

     bsoncxx-v_noabi-rhs-x64-v142-md.lib

  To disable this behavior, set ``ENABLE_ABI_TAG_IN_LIBRARY_FILENAMES=OFF`` as part of
  your CMake configuration.

  The ABI tag string can also be embedded in pkg-config metadata filenames, similar to the
  following:
    
  .. code-block:: bash
      
     libbsoncxx-v_noabi-rhs-x64-v142-md.pc
       
  To enable this behavior, set ``ENABLE_ABI_TAG_IN_LIBRARY_FILENAMES=ON`` and
  ``ENABLE_ABI_TAG_IN_PKGCONFIG_FILENAMES=ON`` as part of your CMake configuration.

`v3.10 Release Notes <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/releases/tag/r3.10.0>`__

.. _version-3.9:

What's New in 3.9
-----------------

.. warning:: Build System Breaking Changes

   The v3.9 driver introduces the following breaking changes:

   - Removes support for exported targets from the CMake project build tree
   - Drops support for macOS 10.14, macOS 10.15, and Ubuntu 14.04
   - Requires MongoDB C Driver v1.25.0 or later
   - Requires CMake v3.15 or later to support the ``FetchContent`` module

The v3.9 driver release includes the following new features:

- The {+driver-short+} container image is now available on
  `Docker hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver>`__.
- The driver automatically downloads the MongoDB C Driver dependency if you don't provide
  it.
- The driver no longer builds tests as part of the ``all`` target. To build tests,
  set ``BUILD_TESTING=ON`` as part of your CMake configuration.
- The driver uses the ``FetchContent`` module to download and build the
  `MNMLSTC Core <https://github.com/mnmlstc/core>`__ polyfill library, if not
  provided by the system, instead of the ``ExternalProject`` module. It also does not
  patch ``include`` directives in MNMLSTC Core headers.
- Adds the CMake option ``MONGOCXX_OVERRIDE_DEFAULT_INSTALL_PREFIX``. If this option is set to
  ``TRUE``, the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` option defaults to the build directory.
  The default value of this option is ``TRUE``.
- Adds an API for managing
  :atlas:`Atlas Search indexes </atlas-search/manage-indexes/>`.
- Adds the ``VERSIONINFO`` resource to ``bsoncxx.dll`` and ``mongocxx.dll``.
- Explicitly documents that throwing an exception from an APM callback is undefined behavior.
- Does not prematurely install MNMLSTC Core headers during the CMake build step.
- Requires that a MongoDB C Driver CMake package is found via ``find_dependency()`` for all
  installed {+driver-short+} package configurations.
