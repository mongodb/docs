Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to run a **text search** in the MongoDB
Java driver.

You can use a text search to retrieve documents that contain a **term**
or a **phrase** in a specified field. A term is a sequence of characters
that excludes whitespace characters. A phrase is a sequence of terms
with any number of whitespace characters. 

The following sections show you how to perform the following types of
text searches:

- Search Text by a Term
- Search Text by a Phrase
- Search Text with Terms Excluded

If you want to sort your text search results, see the :ref:`Text Search
<sorts-crud-text-search>` section of our Sort Results guide. 

Sample Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following sections feature examples of text searches on the
``fast_and_furious_movies`` collection. Each section uses a variable
named ``collection`` to refer to the ``MongoCollection`` instance of the
``fast_and_furious_movies`` collection. 

The ``fast_and_furious_movies`` collection contains documents that
describe one of the several movies that are part of the Fast and Furious
movie franchise. Each document contains a title field and a tags field.

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id": 1, "title": "2 Fast 2 Furious ", "tags": ["undercover", "drug dealer"] } 
   { "_id": 2, "title": "Fast 5", "tags": ["bank robbery", "full team"] }
   { "_id": 3, "title": "Furious 7", "tags": ["emotional"] }
   { "_id": 4, "title": "The Fate of the Furious", "tags": ["betrayal"] }

Text Index
~~~~~~~~~~

You must create a **text index** before running a text search. A text
index specifies the string or string array field on which to run a text
search.

In the following examples, you run text searches on the ``title``
field in the ``fast_and_furious_movies`` collection. To enable text
searches on the ``title`` field, create a text index using the
:ref:`Indexes <index-text-indexes>` builder with the following 
snippet: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/SearchText.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin textIndex
   :end-before: end textIndex

For more information, see the following resources:

- :ref:`Text Indexes <text-indexes>` section of our Indexes guide
- :manual:`Text Indexes </core/index-text/>` Server Manual Entry


Text Search
-----------

Use the ``Filters.text()`` method to specify a text search. 

The ``Filters.text()`` method uses the :doc:`Filters builder
</builders/filters>` to define a query filter specifying
what to search for during the text search. The query filter is
represented by a :ref:`BSON <bson>` instance. Pass the query filter to the
``find()`` method to run a text search. 

When you execute the ``find()`` method, MongoDB runs a text search on
all the fields indexed with the text index on the collection. MongoDB
returns documents that contain one or more of the search terms and a
relevance score for each result. For more information about relevance
scores, see the :ref:`Text Search <sorts-crud-text-search>` section in
our Sort Results guide.  

Specify Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can include ``TextSearchOptions`` as the second parameter of the
``Filters.text()`` method to specify text search options such as case
sensitivity. By default, text searches run without case sensitivity
which means the search matches lowercase and uppercase values.

To specify a case sensitive search, use the following snippet:

.. code-block:: java

   TextSearchOptions options = new TextSearchOptions().caseSensitive(true);
   Bson filter = Filters.text("SomeText", options);

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API Documentation:

- `Filters.text() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/Filters.html#text(java.lang.String)>`__
- `TextSearchOptions <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/TextSearchOptions.html>`__

.. _term_search:

Search Text by a Term
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pass a term as a string to the ``Filters.text()`` method to specify the
term in your text search. 

Example 
```````

The following example runs a text search on the documents in the
``fast_and_furious_movies`` collection for titles that contain the
term "fast":

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/SearchText.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin termExample
   :end-before: end termExample

The following shows the output of the preceding code:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "_id": 1, "title": "2 Fast 2 Furious ", "tags": ["undercover", "drug dealer"] }
   { "_id": 2, "title": "Fast 5", "tags": ["bank robbery", "full team"] }

To match multiple terms in your text search, separate each term
with spaces in the ``Filters.text()`` builder method. The builder method
returns the text search query as a ``Bson`` instance. When you pass
this to the ``find()`` method, it returns documents that match any of
the terms.

Example 
```````

The following example runs a text search on the documents in the
``fast_and_furious_movies`` collection for titles that contain the
terms "fate" or "7":

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/SearchText.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin multipleTermExample
   :end-before: end multipleTermExample

The following shows the output of the preceding code:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "_id": 3, "title": "Furious 7", "tags": ["emotional"] }
   { "_id": 4, "title": "The Fate of the Furious", "tags": ["betrayal"] }

Search Text by a Phrase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pass a phrase with **escaped quotes** to the ``Filters.text()`` method to
specify the phrase in your text search. Escaped quotes are double quote
characters preceded by a backslash character. If you don't add escaped
quotes around the phrase, the ``find()`` method runs a :ref:`term search
<term_search>`. 

Example 
```````

The following example runs a text search on the documents in the
``fast_and_furious_movies`` collection for titles that contain the
phrase "fate of the furious":

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/SearchText.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin phraseExample
   :end-before: end phraseExample

The following shows the output of the preceding code:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "_id": 4, "title": "The Fate of the Furious", "tags": ["betrayal"] }
 
Search Text with Terms Excluded
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each term you want to exclude from your text search, prefix the term
with a minus sign in the string that you pass to the ``Filters.text()``
builder method. 

None of the documents returned from the search contain the excluded term
in your text index field. 

.. important::

   You must have at least one text search term if you want to
   exclude terms from your search. 

Example 
```````

The following example runs a text search on the documents in the
``fast_and_furious_movies`` collection for titles that contain the
term "furious", but do not contain the term "fast":

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/SearchText.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin negateExample
   :end-before: end negateExample

The following shows the output of the preceding code:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "_id": 3, "title": "Furious 7", "tags": ["emotional"] }
   { "_id": 4, "title": "The Fate of the Furious", "tags": ["betrayal"] }
