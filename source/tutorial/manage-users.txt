Overview
--------

To access |service|, you must have an |service| user account. If you
are an existing MongoDB Cloud Manager user, you can use your Cloud
Manager credentials.

To access an organization or a project within that organization, a user
must be a member of that organization. Depending on the user's
:ref:`role in the organization <organization-roles>`, the |service|
user may be required to be a member of the project as well to access a
project.

To access clusters in a project, users must belong to that project.
Users can belong to multiple projects.

Within an organization, you can group users into teams. Users can
belong multiple teams. Teams can be assigned to multiple projects, and
team members' access to the project is determined by the team's
:ref:`project role <project-roles>`.

.. important::

   |service| users are separate from MongoDB database users. Database
   users can access MongoDB databases, while |service| users can access
   the |service| application itself.
