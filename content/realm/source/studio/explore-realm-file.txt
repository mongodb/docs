Overview
--------

When you open a realm file in Realm Studio, you can:

- View live objects in realtime
- Query objects in the realm
- Export SDK model definitions

This makes it a valuable tool for developing and debugging applications 
backed by Realm. 

View Live Objects in Realtime
-----------------------------

Realm Studio gives you the ability to view live objects while you're 
running a client app in an emulator. You can see how functions in your 
app are transforming objects in realtime. This is a powerful debugging 
and development tool.

To view live objects in Realm Studio, you'll need to :ref:`find your realm 
file <realm-studio-find-a-realm-file>`. Once you know your realm file 
path, you can open it in Realm Studio while your app is running.

.. note::

   Unfortunately, Android emulators do not support viewing live objects 
   in Realm Studio. If you're developing for Android, you must download 
   the file from the emulator before you can access it.

Query Objects in the Realm
--------------------------

Realm Studio enables you to query the objects in the realm file. The 
ability to do this in the realm via Realm Studio gives you a visual 
tool to:

- Quickly view query results
- Experiment with query syntax
- Validate the data in the realm file

The Realm Studio query bar at the top of the main pane 
accepts the :ref:`Realm JavaScript query syntax<node-client-query-engine>`. 
You can query using:

- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- String operators

You can also view a reference document that details the query options from 
within Realm Studio. Press the :guilabel:`?` button next to the query bar.

Export SDK Model Definitions
----------------------------

Realm Studio enables you to export model definitions, streamlining 
cross-platform development.

For example, you may be an iOS developer who has already created a 
schema in an existing app. You now need to declare the same schema for 
your Android app. Recreating that schema in another programming language 
can be time-consuming and error-prone. Instead, you can open your realm 
file in Realm Studio, and export the model definition in Java.
