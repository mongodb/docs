:manual:`Time series collections </core/timeseries-collections/>` efficiently 
store sequences of measurements over a period of time. 

Limitations
-----------

The following restrictions and limitations apply when creating a time series 
collection:

- :guilabel:`Custom collation` is the only :guilabel:`Advanced Collection Option` 
  that you can use with your time series collection.  

- See :manual:`Time Series Collection Limitations </core/timeseries/timeseries-limitations/>` 
  for all time series collection limitations.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Create Collection` button.

      From the :guilabel:`Collections` screen, click the 
      :guilabel:`Create Collection` button.

   .. step:: Enter the collection name.

   .. step:: Check the :guilabel:`Time Series Collection` option.

   .. step:: Specify a :guilabel:`timeField`.

      Specify which field should be used as the ``timeField`` for the time-series 
      collection. This field must have a :manual:`BSON type date </reference/bson-types/>`.

   .. step:: *Optional*. Specify a :guilabel:`metaField`.

      Specify the name of the field that contains metadata in each time
      series document. The metadata in the specified field should be
      data that is used to label a unique series of documents. 

   .. step:: *Optional*. Select a :guilabel:`granularity` from the dropdown.

      Specify a coarser granularity so measurements over a longer time
      span can be more efficiently stored and queried. The default value
      is ``"seconds"``. 

      If you set the ``granularity`` parameter, you can't set the
      ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds`` and ``bucketRoundingSeconds`` parameters. 

   .. step:: *Optional*. Specify a numeric value for the following fields.

      .. list-table:: 
         :widths: 20 10 70
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Field 
           - Type 
           - Description
         
         * - ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds``
           - number
           - Specifies the maximum time span between measurements in a bucket. 

             The value of ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds`` must be the same as 
             ``bucketRoundingSeconds``. If you set the ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds``, 
             parameter, you can't set the ``granularity`` parameter.

         * - ``bucketRoundingSeconds``
           - number
           - Specifies the time interval that determines the starting timestamp 
             for a new bucket. 

             The value of ``bucketRoundingSeconds`` must be the same as 
             ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds``. If you set the ``bucketRoundingSeconds``, 
             parameter, you can't set the ``granularity`` parameter.

         * - ``expireAfterSeconds``
           - number
           - Enables the automatic deletion of documents that are older than 
             the specified number of seconds.  

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Create Collection` to create the collection.

      Your collection will be marked by a :guilabel:`time series` badge.

Object Fields </core/timeseries/timeseries-procedures/#timeseries-object-fields>`.
