The cluster tier dictates the memory, storage, and IOPS
specification for each data-bearing server [#data-bearing]_ in the
cluster.

Shared Clusters
---------------

Shared clusters are economical clusters for getting started with MongoDB
and for low-throughput applications. These clusters deploy to a shared
environment with access to a subset of |service| features and
functionality. For complete documentation on shared cluster limits and
restrictions, see :ref:`atlas-free-tier`. 

``M0`` clusters are free sandbox replica set clusters. You can deploy
one ``M0`` cluster per |service| project. You can :doc:`upgrade
</scale-cluster>` an ``M0`` Free Tier cluster to an ``M2+`` paid cluster
at any time.

``M2`` and ``M5`` clusters are low-cost shared starter clusters.
These clusters provide the following additional features and
functionality compared to ``M0`` clusters:

- :ref:`Backups <m2-m5-snapshots>` for your cluster data

- Increased storage

- :doc:`API access </api>`

Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- |service| deploys MongoDB 4.2 for all
  :term:`Shared Clusters <shared cluster>` (``M0``, ``M2``, and ``M5``).
  However, Shared Clusters Clusters do not support all functionality in
  MongoDB version 4.2 and later. See :ref:`atlas-free-tier` for details.

  .. include:: /includes/admonitions/version-4.4-beta-shared-tier-exception.rst

- |service| supports shared cluster deployment in a subset of
  Cloud Providers and Regions. |service| greys out any
  shared cluster tiers not supported by the selected
  cloud service provider and region. For a complete list of
  regions that support shared cluster deployments, see:

  - :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>`
  - :ref:`Google Cloud Platform (GCP) <google-gcp>`
  - :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>`

.. _atlas-low-traffic-tier:

Dedicated Clusters for Low-Traffic Applications
-----------------------------------------------

These cluster tiers support development environments and low-traffic
applications.

These clusters support replica set deployments only, but otherwise
provide full access to |service| features and functionality.

.. note::

   MongoDB recommends ``M10`` and ``M20`` clusters for

   - Development environments
   - Low-traffic production use

.. include:: /includes/system-steal-fact.rst

.. _atlas-high-traffic-tier:

Dedicated Clusters for High-Traffic Applications
------------------------------------------------

``M30`` and higher cluster tiers support production environments with high
traffic applications and large datasets.

These clusters support replica set and sharded cluster deployments with
full access to |service| features and functionality.

Some clusters have variants, denoted by the |angle| character. When you
select these clusters, |service| lists the variants and tags each
cluster to distinguish their key characteristics.

.. _nvme-storage:

NVMe Storage on AWS Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For applications hosted on :ref:`AWS <amazon-aws>` which require
low-latency and high-throughput I/O, |service| offers storage options
which leverage locally attached ephemeral |nvme| |ssd|\s. The following
cluster tiers have an |nvme| option, with the size fixed at the cluster
tier:

- ``M40``
- ``M50``
- ``M60``
- ``M80``
- ``M200``
- ``M400``

Clusters with |nvme| storage use
:doc:`{+Cloud-Backup+}s </backup/cloud-backup/overview>` for
backup. You can't disable backup on |nvme| clusters.

|nvme| clusters use a
:manual:`hidden secondary node </core/replica-set-hidden-member>`
consisting of a provisioned volume with high throughput and |iops| to
facilitate backup.

.. note::

   |nvme| clusters auto-scale to the next higher tier when 90% of the
   available storage space is consumed, and the migration requires an
   :term:`initial sync`.
