You can view the history of previous conversions in the left-hand 
:guilabel:`Query Converter` pane. Each conversion has an icon 
indicating the result of the conversion. If an object does not have 
an icon next to it, a conversion has not been attempted yet:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Icon 
     - Description

   * - Spinner
     - The conversion is now being executed.

   * - Green check mark
     - The conversion was successful.

   * - Red exclamation mark
     - The conversion failed on last attempt.
