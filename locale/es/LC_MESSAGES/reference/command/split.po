"Be careful when splitting data in a sharded collection to create new "
"chunks. When you shard a collection that has existing data, MongoDB "
"automatically creates chunks to evenly distribute the collection. To "
"split data effectively in a sharded cluster you must consider the number "
"of documents in a chunk and the average document size to create a uniform"
" chunk size. When chunks have irregular sizes, shards may have an equal "
"number of chunks but have very different data sizes. Avoid creating "
"splits that lead to a collection with differently sized chunks."
