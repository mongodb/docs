   Upgrade the :ref:`secondary <replica-set-secondary-members>` members
   of the replica set one at a time:

   #. Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

   #. Restart with the Enterprise :binary:`~bin.mongod`, specifying the
      same configuration options (e.g. same data directory,
      configuration file, etc.).

   Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state before
   upgrading the next secondary member.

   election of a new primary.

   #. Shut down the stepped-down primary.

   #. Restart with the Enterprise :binary:`~bin.mongod`, specifying the
      same configuration options (e.g. same data directory,
      configuration file, etc.).
