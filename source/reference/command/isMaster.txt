.. dbcommand:: isMaster

   :dbcommand:`isMaster` returns a document that describes the role of
   the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. If the optional field
   ``saslSupportedMechs`` is specified, the command also returns an
   :data:`array of SASL mechanisms <isMaster.saslSupportedMechs>` used
   to create the specified user's credentials.

   If the instance is a member of a
   replica set, then :dbcommand:`isMaster` returns a subset of the
   replica set configuration and status including whether or not the
   instance is the :term:`primary` of the replica set.

   When sent to a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance that is not a member of a
   replica set, :dbcommand:`isMaster` returns a subset of this
   information.

   MongoDB :term:`drivers <driver>` and :term:`clients <client>` use
   :dbcommand:`isMaster` to determine the state of the replica set
   members and to discover additional members of a :term:`replica
   set`.

Syntax
------

The command takes the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { isMaster: 1 } )

Starting in MongoDB 4.0, the :dbcommand:`isMaster` command accepts
optional fields ``saslSupportedMechs: <db.user>`` to return an
additional field :data:`isMaster.saslSupportedMechs` in its result
and ``comment <any>`` to add a log comment associated with the command.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { isMaster: 1, saslSupportedMechs: "<db.username>", comment: <any> } )
   
The :method:`db.isMaster()` method in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
provides a wrapper around :dbcommand:`isMaster`.

Output
------

All Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following :dbcommand:`isMaster` fields are common across all
roles:

.. data:: isMaster.ismaster

   A boolean value that reports when this node is writable. If
   ``true``, then this instance is a :term:`primary` in a
   :term:`replica set`, or a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance, or a standalone
   :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

   This field will be ``false`` if the instance is a
   :term:`secondary` member of a replica set or if the member is an
   :term:`arbiter` of a replica set.

.. data:: isMaster.topologyVersion

   *For internal use by MongoDB.*

   .. versionadded:: 4.4

.. data:: isMaster.maxBsonObjectSize

   The maximum permitted size of a :term:`BSON` object in bytes for
   this :binary:`~bin.mongod` process. If not provided, clients should
   assume a max size of "``16 * 1024 * 1024``".

.. data:: isMaster.maxMessageSizeBytes

   The maximum permitted size of a :term:`BSON` wire protocol message.
   The default value is ``48000000`` bytes.

.. data:: isMaster.maxWriteBatchSize

   The maximum number of write operations permitted in a write batch.
   If a batch exceeds this
   :limit:`limit<Write Command Batch Limit Size>`, the client
   driver divides the batch into smaller groups each with counts less
   than or equal to the value of this field.

   The value of this limit is ``100,000`` writes.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6

      The limit raises from ``1,000`` to ``100,000`` writes. This limit
      also applies to legacy ``OP_INSERT`` messages.

.. data:: isMaster.localTime

   Returns the local server time in UTC. This value is an
   :term:`ISO date <ISODate>`.

.. data:: isMaster.logicalSessionTimeoutMinutes

   .. versionadded:: 3.6

   .. include:: /includes/fact-session-timeout.rst

   Only available when ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` is ``"3.6"`` or greater.
   See :ref:`3.6-compatibility-enabled`.
 
.. data:: isMaster.connectionId

   .. versionadded:: 4.2

   An identifier for the :binary:`~bin.mongod`/:binary:`~bin.mongos`
   instance's outgoing connection to the client.

.. data:: isMaster.minWireVersion

   The earliest version of the wire protocol that this
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance is capable of using
   to communicate with clients.

   Clients may use :data:`~isMaster.minWireVersion` to help negotiate
   compatibility with MongoDB.

.. data:: isMaster.maxWireVersion

   The latest version of the wire protocol that this :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance is capable of using to communicate
   with clients.

   Clients may use :data:`~isMaster.maxWireVersion` to help negotiate
   compatibility with MongoDB.

.. data:: isMaster.readOnly

   .. versionadded:: 3.4
   
   A boolean value that, when ``true``, indicates that the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` is running in read-only mode.

.. data:: isMaster.compression

   .. versionadded:: 3.4

   An array listing the compression algorithms used or available for
   use (i.e. common to both the client and the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance) to compress the communication
   between the client and the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

   The field is only available if compression is used. For example:

   - If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` is enabled to use both the
     ``snappy,zlib`` compressors and a client has specified ``zlib``,
     the :data:`~isMaster.compression` field would contain:

     .. code-block:: javascript
   
        "compression": [ "zlib" ]

   - If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` is enabled to use both the
     ``snappy,zlib`` compressors and a client has specified ``zlib,snappy``,
     the :data:`~isMaster.compression` field would contain:

     .. code-block:: javascript
   
        "compression": [ "zlib", "snappy" ]

   - If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` is enabled to use  the
     ``snappy`` compressor and a client has specified ``zlib,snappy``,
     the :data:`~isMaster.compression` field would contain :

     .. code-block:: javascript
   
        "compression": [ "snappy" ]

   - If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` is enabled to use  the ``snappy``
     compressor and a client has specified ``zlib`` or the client has
     specified no compressor, the field is omitted.

   That is, if the client does not specify compression or if the client
   specifies a compressor not enabled for the connected
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance, the field
   does not return.

.. data:: isMaster.saslSupportedMechs

   An array of SASL mechanisms used to create the user's credential or
   credentials.  Supported SASL mechanisms are:

   - ``GSSAPI``
   - ``SCRAM-SHA-256``
   - ``SCRAM-SHA-1``

   The field is returned only when the command is run with the
   ``saslSupportedMechs`` field:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { isMaster: 1, saslSupportedMechs: "<db.username>" } )

Sharded Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances add the following field to the
:dbcommand:`isMaster` response document:

.. data:: isMaster.msg

   Contains the value ``isdbgrid`` when :dbcommand:`isMaster`
   returns from a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`isMaster` contains these fields when returned by a member
of a replica set:

.. data:: isMaster.hosts

   An array of strings in the format of ``"[hostname]:[port]"`` that
   lists all members of the :term:`replica set` that are neither
   :term:`hidden <hidden member>`, :term:`passive <passive member>`,
   nor :term:`arbiters <arbiter>`.

   Drivers use this array and the :data:`isMaster.passives` to determine
   which members to read from.

.. data:: isMaster.setName

   The name of the current :replica set.

.. data:: isMaster.setVersion

   The current replica set config version.

.. data:: isMaster.secondary

   A boolean value that, when ``true``, indicates if the

   set`.

.. data:: isMaster.passives

   An array of strings in the format of ``"[hostname]:[port]"``
   listing all members of the :term:`replica set` which have a
   :rsconf:`members[n].priority` of ``0``.

   This field only appears if there is at least one member with a
   :rsconf:`members[n].priority` of ``0``.

   Drivers use this array and the :data:`isMaster.hosts` to determine
   which members to read from.

.. data:: isMaster.arbiters

   An array of strings  in the format of ``"[hostname]:[port]"``
   listing all members of the :term:`replica set` that are
   :term:`arbiters <arbiter>`.

   replica set.

.. data:: isMaster.primary

   A string in the format of ``"[hostname]:[port]"`` listing the
   current :term:`primary` member of the replica set.

.. data:: isMaster.arbiterOnly

   A boolean value that , when ``true``, indicates that the current
   instance is an :term:`arbiter`.  The :data:`~isMaster.arbiterOnly`
   field is only present, if the instance is an arbiter.

.. data:: isMaster.passive

   A boolean value that, when ``true``, indicates that the current
   instance is :term:`passive <passive member>`.  The
   :data:`~isMaster.passive` field is only present for members with a
   :rsconf:`members[n].priority` of ``0``.

.. data:: isMaster.hidden

   A boolean value that, when ``true``, indicates that the current
