=============================
Replica Set Protocol Versions
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb


MongoDB provides replica set protocol version 0 (``pv0``) and replica
set protocol version 1 (``pv1``). ``pv1`` is the default for all new
replica sets created with MongoDB 3.2 or later.

The following outlines some differences between ``pv0`` and ``pv1``.

.. include:: /includes/note-pv0-deprecation.rst

Preservation of Writes
----------------------

``w:1`` Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The deprecated ``pv0`` prioritizes preservation of :writeconcern:`w:1
<\<number\>>` writes

``pv1`` increases the likelihood of :writeconcern:`w:1 <\<number\>>`
rollbacks compared to ``pv0`` for the following versions:

- MongoDB 3.4.1

- MongoDB 3.4.0

- MongoDB 3.2.11 or earlier

However, for ``pv1`` in MongoDB 3.4 and later, you can configure
:rsconf:`~settings.catchUpTimeoutMillis` to prioritize preservation of
:writeconcern:`w:1 <\<number\>>` writes.

``w: "majority"`` Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The deprecated ``pv0`` can lose confirmed :writeconcern:`w: "majority"
<"majority">` writes.

``pv1`` guarantees the preservation of confirmed :writeconcern:`w:
"majority" <"majority">` writes.

Availability
------------

- The deprecated ``pv0`` is available in all MongoDB versions.

- ``pv1`` is available in MongoDB version 3.2 or later and is the
  default for all new replica sets created with version 3.2 or later.

Arbiters
--------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/arbiters-and-pvs.rst

Priorities
----------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/priorities-and-pvs.rst

Vetoes
------

The deprecated ``pv0`` allows members to :ref:`veto elections
<replica-set-vetoes>` based on member's :data:`optime
<replSetGetStatus.members.optime>` and :rsconf:`~members[n].priority`
values.

``pv1`` does not use vetoes. Individual members can vote for or against
a candidate in a particular election, but cannot individually veto (abort)
an election unilaterally.

.. _simultaneous-primaries:

Detection of Simultaneous Primaries
-----------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/footnote-two-primaries-edge-cases.rst

The deprecated ``pv0`` relies on clock synchronization to disambiguate
when two members both think they are primary.

.. warning::

   Reliance on clock synchronization can lead to the loss of confirmed
   :writeconcern:`w: "majority" <"majority">` writes.

``pv1`` uses the concept of :term:`term` instead of clock
synchronization. This allows for a faster detection of simultaneous
primaries and for multiple successful elections in a short period of
time.

Back to Back Elections
----------------------

The deprecated ``pv0`` includes a 30 seconds buffer between
back-to-back elections as a precaution against poor clock
synchronization. This buffer helps reduce the number of back to back
elections. However, ``pv0`` can leave a replica set with no primary if
multiple elections are needed in a short period of time.

``pv1`` makes a "best-effort" attempt to have the secondary with the
highest :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` available call an election. This
could lead to back-to-back elections as eligible members with
higher priority can call an election.

However, in MongoDB 3.6 (as well as MongoDB 3.4.2+ and 3.2.12+), for ``pv1``:

- Priority elections have been limited to occur only if the higher
  priority node is within 10 seconds of the current primary. 

- Arbiters will vote no in elections if they detect a healthy primary
  of equal or greater priority to the candidate.

Double Voting
-------------

``pv1`` prevents double voting in one member's call for election. This
is achieved through its use of :term:`terms <term>`.

The deprecated ``pv0`` lessens the likelihood of double-voting via the
30-second buffer, but cannot guarantee that a member will not double
vote if an election exceeds 30-seconds.

.. _rs-pv-modify:

Modify Replica Set Protocol Version
------------------------------------

Before changing the protocol version, ensure that at least one oplog
entry (generated from the current protocol version) has replicated from
the primary to all secondaries. To verify, on each secondary, check the
:data:`optimes.lastCommittedOpTime.t
<replSetGetStatus.optimes.lastCommittedOpTime>` field returned from
:method:`rs.status()`. For example, connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo`
shell to each secondary and run:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.status().optimes.lastCommittedOpTime.t

- If the current replica set protocol version is ``0``, the ``t`` is equal
  to ``-1``.

- If the current replica set protocol version is ``1``, the ``t`` is greater
  than ``-1``.

Once you have verified that at least one oplog entry (using the current
protocol version) has replicated to all the secondaries, you can change
the protocol version.

To change the replica set protocol version, reconfigure
(:method:`rs.reconfig`) the replica set with the new
:rsconf:`protocolVersion`. For example, to upgrade to ``pv1``, connect
a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the current primary and perform the
following sequence of operations:

.. code-block:: sh

   cfg = rs.conf();
   cfg.protocolVersion=1;
   rs.reconfig(cfg);

To reduce the likelihood of :writeconcern:`w:1 <\<number\>>` rollbacks,
you can also reconfigure the replica set to a higher
:rsconf:`settings.catchUpTimeoutMillis` setting.
