TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static type
checking and other features intended to make
application-scale development more robust. If you'd like to
use TypeScript in your project, follow the React Native
team's official `TypeScript and React Native guide
<https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/typescript#adding-typescript-to-an-existing-project>`__.
The SDK supports TypeScript natively and integrates easily
into a TypeScript project.
