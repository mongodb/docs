Create the Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example uses an ``orders`` collection, which contains documents
describing individual product orders. Because each order corresponds to
only one customer, the aggregation groups order documents by the ``customer_id``
field, which contains customer email addresses.

First, create a Go struct to model the data in the ``orders``
collection:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/group/models.snippet.order.go
   :language: go
   :copyable: true
   :category: usage example

To create the ``orders`` collection and insert the sample data, add the
following code to your application:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/group/load-data.snippet.example.go
   :language: go
   :copyable: true
   :category: usage example

   .. step:: Add a match stage for orders in 2020.

      First, add a :pipeline:`$match` stage that matches
      orders placed in 2020:

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/group/run-pipeline.snippet.match.go
         :language: go
         :copyable: true
         :category: syntax example

   .. step:: Add a sort stage to sort by order date.

      Next, add a :pipeline:`$sort` stage to set an
      ascending sort on the ``orderdate`` field to retrieve the earliest
      2020 purchase for each customer in the next stage:

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/group/run-pipeline.snippet.sort-orderdate.go
         :language: go
         :copyable: true
         :category: syntax example

   .. step:: Add a group stage to group by email address.

      Add a :pipeline:`$group` stage to collect
      order documents by the value of the ``customer_id`` field. In this
      stage, add aggregation operations that create the
      following fields in the result documents:

      - ``first_purchase_date``: the date of the customer's first purchase
      - ``total_value``: the total value of all the customer's purchases
      - ``total_orders``: the total number of the customer's purchases
      - ``orders``: the list of all the customer's purchases,
        including the date and value of each purchase

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/group/run-pipeline.snippet.group.go
         :language: go
         :copyable: true
         :category: syntax example

   .. step:: Add a sort stage to sort by first order date.

      Next, add another :pipeline:`$sort` stage to set an
      ascending sort on the ``first_purchase_date`` field:

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/group/run-pipeline.snippet.sort-first-purchase-date.go
         :language: go
         :copyable: true
         :category: syntax example

   .. step:: Add a set stage to display the email address.

      Add a :pipeline:`$set` stage to recreate the
      ``customer_id`` field from the values in the ``_id`` field
      that were set during the ``$group`` stage:

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/group/run-pipeline.snippet.set.go
         :language: go
         :copyable: true
         :category: syntax example

   .. step:: Add an unset stage to remove unneeded fields.

      Finally, add an :pipeline:`$unset` stage. The
      ``$unset`` stage removes the ``_id`` field from the result
      documents:

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/group/run-pipeline.snippet.unset.go
         :language: go
         :copyable: true
         :category: syntax example

   .. step:: Run the aggregation pipeline.

      Add the following code to the end of your application to perform
      the aggregation on the ``orders`` collection:

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/group/run-pipeline.snippet.run-agg.go
         :language: go
         :copyable: true
         :category: syntax example

      Finally, run the application and inspect the results.

   .. step:: Interpret the aggregation results.

      The aggregation returns the following summary of customers' orders
      from 2020:

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/group/output.txt
         :language: text
         :copyable: false
         :category: example return object

      The result documents contain details from all the orders from
      a given customer, grouped by the customer's email address.
