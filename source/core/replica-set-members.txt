A *replica set* in MongoDB is a group of :binary:`~bin.mongod` processes
that provide redundancy and high availability. The members of a
replica set are:

:ref:`replica-set-primary-member`.
   The primary receives all write operations.

:ref:`replica-set-secondary-members`.
   Secondaries replicate operations from the primary to maintain an
   identical data set. Secondaries may have additional configurations
   for special usage profiles. For example, secondaries may be
   :ref:`non-voting <replica-set-non-voting-members>` or
   :ref:`priority 0 <replica-set-secondary-only-members>`.

You can also maintain an :ref:`arbiter <replica-set-arbiters>` as part
of a replica set. Arbiters do not keep a copy of the data. However,
arbiters play a role in the elections that select a primary if the
current primary is unavailable.

The minimum recommended configuration for a replica set is a three
member replica set with three data-bearing members: one :ref:`primary
<replica-set-primary-member>` and two :ref:`secondary
<replica-set-secondary-members>` members. You may alternatively deploy
a three member replica set with *two* data-bearing members: a
:ref:`primary <replica-set-primary-member>`, a :ref:`secondary
<replica-set-secondary-members>`, and an :ref:`arbiter
<replica-set-arbiters>`, but replica sets with at least three
data-bearing members offer better redundancy.

A replica set can have up to :ref:`50 members
<3.0-replica-sets-max-members>` but only 7 voting members.
