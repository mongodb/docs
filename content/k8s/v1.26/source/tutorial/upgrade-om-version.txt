=================================================

Update the major and minor versions of your |onprem| instance and :term:`backing databases`
in the :ref:`k8s-om-specification` that the |k8s-op-short| uses to manage your deployment.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. warning::

   To maintain existing settings and availability, back up the following in your current |onprem| instance: 
   
   - Your ``conf-mms.properties`` to a secure location. The ``conf-mms.properties``
     stores settings for the |onprem| instance.
   - Your ``gen.key`` files to a secure location. The :ref:`gen.key <gen-key>`
     provides details to encrypt and decrypt |onprem|\'s backing databases
     and user credentials. |onprem| might delete these files as part of the upgrade process.
   
   As an extra precaution, you may use :dbtools:`mongodump 
   </mongodump>` to create a binary export of the 
   :opsmgr:`Application Database 
   </reference/glossary/#std-term-application-database>`. No officially 
   supported backup method exists for the {+appdb+}. If the 
   upgrade fails, reach out to |mdb-support| for help fixing the 
   issue with the |onprem| version.

1. Upgrade |onprem| by following the considerations, prerequisites, and procedure in :ref:`upgrade-om`.

2. Reference :ref:`compatible-mdb-versions` to ensure your :term:`backing databases`
   use a MongoDB version that is compatible with the new |onprem| version.

3. If you need to upgrade your backing databases to a compatible MongoDB version,
   see :ref:`meko-upgrade-mdb-version`.

Procedure
---------

To upgrade |onprem| and the application database versions, complete the
following steps:
