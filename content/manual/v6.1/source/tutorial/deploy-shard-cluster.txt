Overview
--------

This tutorial involves creating a new sharded cluster that consists of a
:binary:`~bin.mongos`, the config server replica set, and two shard
replica sets.

Considerations
--------------

Connectivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each member of a sharded cluster must be able to connect to *all* other
members in the cluster. This includes all shards and config servers.
Ensure that network and security systems, including all interface and
firewalls, allow these connections.

Hostnames and Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/important-hostnames.rst

Localhost Deployments
`````````````````````

If you use either ``localhost`` or its IP address as the hostname
portion of any host identifier, you *must* use that identifier as the
host setting for any other MongoDB component in the cluster.

For example, the :method:`sh.addShard()` method takes a ``host``
parameter for the hostname of the target shard. If you set ``host`` to
``localhost``, you must then use ``localhost`` as the host for all other
shards in the cluster.

Security
~~~~~~~~

This tutorial does *not* include the required steps for configuring
:doc:`/core/security-internal-authentication` or
:doc:`/core/authorization`.

In production environments, sharded clusters should employ at
minimum :doc:`/core/security-x.509` security for internal authentication
and client access.

Procedure
---------

.. _sharding-setup-start-cfgsrvr:

Create the Config Server Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps deploys a config server replica set.

For a production deployment, deploy a config server replica set with at
least three members. For testing purposes, you can create a
single-member replica set.

.. note::

   The config server replica set must not use the same name as any of
   the shard replica sets.

For this tutorial, the config server replica set members are associated
with the following hosts:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Config Server Replica Set Member
     - Hostname

   * - Member 0
     - ``cfg1.example.net``

   * - Member 1
     - ``cfg2.example.net``

   * - Member 2
     - ``cfg3.example.net``

.. include:: /includes/steps/deploy-sharded-cluster-config-server-noauth.rst

Once the config server replica set (CSRS) is initiated and up, proceed
to creating the shard replica sets.

.. _sharding-setup-start-shard-replica-set:

Create the Shard Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a production deployment, use a replica set with at least three
members. For testing purposes, you can create a single-member replica
set.

.. note::

   Shard replica sets must not use the same name as the config server replica set.

For each shard, use the following steps to create the shard replica set:

.. include:: /includes/steps/deploy-sharded-cluster-shard-replica-noauth.rst

.. _sharding-setup-start-mongos:

Start a ``mongos`` for the Sharded Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start a :binary:`~bin.mongos` using either a configuration file or a
command line parameter to specify the config servers.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Configuration File
      :tabid: config-file

      If using a configuration file, set the
      :setting:`sharding.configDB` to the config server replica set
      name and at least one member of the replica set in
      ``<replSetName>/<host:port>`` format.

      .. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst

      .. code-block:: yaml

         sharding:
           configDB: <configReplSetName>/cfg1.example.net:27019,cfg2.example.net:27019
         net:
           bindIp: localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>

      Start the :binary:`~bin.mongos` specifying the ``--config``
      option and the path to the configuration file.

      .. code-block:: bash

         mongos --config <path-to-config>

      For more information on the configuration file, see 
      :doc:`configuration options</reference/configuration-options>`.

   .. tab:: Command Line
      :tabid: command-line

      If using command line parameters start the :binary:`~bin.mongos`
      and specify the ``--configdb``,  ``--bind_ip``, and other
      options as appropriate to your deployment. For example:

      .. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst

      .. code-block:: bash

         mongos --configdb <configReplSetName>/cfg1.example.net:27019,cfg2.example.net:27019,cfg3.example.net:27019 --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>

      Include any other options as appropriate for your deployment.

At this point, your sharded cluster consists of the
:binary:`~bin.mongos` and the config servers.  You can now connect to
the sharded cluster using :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.

Connect to the Sharded Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to the :binary:`~bin.mongos`. 
Specify the ``host`` and ``port`` on which the ``mongos`` is running:

.. code-block:: bash

   mongosh --host <hostname> --port <port>

Once you have connected :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to the
:binary:`~bin.mongos`, continue to the next procedure to add shards to
the cluster.

.. _sharding-setup-add-shards:

Add Shards to the Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a :binary:`~bin.mongosh` session that is connected to the
:binary:`~bin.mongos`, use the :method:`sh.addShard()` method to add
each shard to the cluster.

The following operation adds a single shard replica set to the cluster:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.addShard( "<replSetName>/s1-mongo1.example.net:27018,s1-mongo2.example.net:27018,s1-mongo3.example.net:27018")

Repeat these steps until the cluster includes all desired shards.

.. _sharding-setup-shard-collection:
.. _deploy-hashed-sharded-cluster-shard-collection:
.. _deploy-ranged-sharded-cluster-shard-collection:

Shard a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To shard a collection, connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to the
:binary:`~bin.mongos` and use the :method:`sh.shardCollection()` method. 

.. note:: Sharding and Indexes

   If the collection already contains data, you must
   :ref:`create an index <method-createIndex>` that supports the
   :term:`shard key` before sharding the collection. If the collection
   is empty, MongoDB creates the index as part of
   :method:`sh.shardCollection()`.

MongoDB provides two strategies to shard collections:

- :ref:`Hashed sharding <sharding-hashed>` uses a
  :ref:`hashed index <index-hashed-index>` of a single field as the
  :term:`shard key` to partition data across your sharded cluster.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     sh.shardCollection("<database>.<collection>", { <shard key field> : "hashed" } )

- :ref:`Range-based sharding <sharding-ranged>` can use multiple
  fields as the shard key and divides data into contiguous ranges
  determined by the shard key values.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     sh.shardCollection("<database>.<collection>", { <shard key field> : 1, ... } )

Shard Key Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your selection of shard key affects the efficiency of sharding,
as well as your ability to take advantage of certain sharding
features such as :ref:`zones <zone-sharding>`. To learn how to choose
an effective shard key, see :ref:`sharding-shard-key-selection`.

Starting in version 4.0, :binary:`~bin.mongosh`
provides the method :method:`convertShardKeyToHashed()`. This
method uses the same hashing function as the hashed index and
can be used to see what the hashed value would be for a key.

     :ref:`hashed-sharding-shard-key`
