Overview
--------

This guide explains the BSON data format, how MongoDB uses it, and how to
install the BSON library independently of the MongoDB driver.

BSON Data Format
----------------

BSON, or Binary JSON, is the data format that MongoDB uses to organize
and store data. This data format includes all JSON data structure types in 
JSON and adds support for binary types. BSON is a serialized form of JSON 
optimized for scan speed and transmission over the network. You can read
more about the supported types in the 
:manual:`BSON Types </manual/reference/bson-types/>` server manual.

This binary format is not human-readable, but you can use the
:ref:`Java BSON library <install-bson-library>` to convert it to a JSON
representation. You can read more about the relationship between these
formats in our article on `JSON and BSON <https://www.mongodb.com/json-and-bson>`__.

MongoDB and BSON
----------------

MongoDB uses the BSON data format for reasons including:

- the underlying JSON format aligns well with the document database model
- you can store binary objects in BSON which you cannot do in pure JSON
- the binary format enables send it directly over the wire
- the standardized field metadata enables efficient query and store operations

Install the BSON Library
------------------------

These instructions show you how to add the BSON library as a dependency to
your project. If you added the MongoDB Java driver as a dependency to your 
project, you can skip this step since the BSON library is already included
as a required dependency of the driver. For instructions on how to add the
MongoDB driver as a dependency to your project, see the 
:ref:`driver installation <add-mongodb-dependency>` section of our Quick Start
guide.

We recommend that you use `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__ or 
`Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__ build automation tool to manage your project
dependencies. Select from the tabs below to see the dependency declaration
for that tool:

.. tabs::
   
   .. tab:: Maven
      :tabid: maven-dependencies

      The following snippet shows the dependency declaration in the
      ``dependencies`` section of your ``pom.xml`` file. 

      .. include:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/bson-maven-versioned.rst

   .. tab:: Gradle
      :tabid: gradle-dependencies

      The following snippet shows the dependency declaration in the 
      ``dependencies`` object in your ``build.gradle`` file.

      .. include:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/bson-gradle-versioned.rst

If you are not using one of the aforementioned tools, you can include it in 
your project by downloading the JAR file directly from the 
`sonatype repository <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/mongodb/bson/>`__.
