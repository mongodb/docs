This procedure migrates a :ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>`
in a :doc:`sharded cluster </core/sharding>`
to a new server that uses a different hostname. Use this procedure only
if the config server *will not* be accessible via the same hostname.

Changing a :ref:`config server's <sharding-config-server>` hostname
**requires downtime** and requires restarting every process in the
sharded cluster.
If possible, avoid changing the hostname so that you can instead use the
procedure to :doc:`migrate a config server and use the same hostname
<migrate-config-servers-with-same-hostname>`.

To migrate all the config servers in a cluster, perform this procedure
for each config server separately and migrate the config servers in
reverse order from how they are listed in the :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instances' :setting:`configdb` string. Start with the last config server
listed in the :setting:`configdb` string.

1. Disable the cluster balancer process temporarily. See
   :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily` for more information.

#. Shut down the config server to migrate.

   This renders all config data for the sharded cluster "read only."

#. Copy the contents of :setting:`dbpath` from the old config server to
   the new config server. For example, to copy the contents of
   :setting:`dbpath` to a machine named ``mongodb.config2.example.net``,
   use a command that resembles the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      rsync -az /data/configdb mongodb.config2.example.net:/data/configdb

#. Start the config server instance on the new system. The default
   invocation is:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --configsvr

#. Shut down all existing MongoDB processes. This includes:

   - the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances for the shards.

   - the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances for the existing
     :ref:`config databases <config-database>`.

   - the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

#. Restart all shard :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

#. Restart the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances for the two existing non-migrated
   config servers.

#. Update the :setting:`configdb` setting for each :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   instances.

#. Restart the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

#. Re-enable the balancer to allow the cluster to resume normal
   balancing operations. See the
   :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily` section for more
   information on managing the balancer process.

.. COMMENT per Randolph, we probably can remove the shutdown existing
   config servers in step 5 and the restart of these config servers
