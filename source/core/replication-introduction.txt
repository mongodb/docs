Replication is the process of synchronizing data across multiple
servers.

Purpose of Replication
----------------------

Replication provides redundancy and increases data availability. With
multiple copies of data on different database servers, replication
protects a database from the loss of a single server. Replication also
allows you to recover from hardware failure and service
interruptions. With additional copies of the data, you can dedicate
one to disaster recovery, reporting, or backup.

In some cases, you can use replication to increase read
capacity. Clients have the ability to send read and write operations
to different servers. You can also maintain copies in different data
centers to increase the locality and availability of data for distributed
applications.

Replication in MongoDB
----------------------

A replica set is a group of :program:`mongod` instances that host the
same data set. One :program:`mongod`, the primary, receives all write
operations. All other instances, secondaries, apply operations from
the primary so that they have the same data set.

The **primary** accepts all write operations from clients. Replica set
can have only one primary. Because only one member can accept write
operations, replica sets provide **strict consistency**. To support
replication, the primary logs all changes to its data sets in its
:doc:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog>`. See
:doc:`primary </core/replica-set-primary>` for more information.

.. include:: /images/replica-set-read-write-operations-primary.rst

The **secondaries** replicate the primary's oplog and apply the
operations to their data sets. Secondaries' data sets reflect the
primary's data set. If the primary is unavailable, the replica set
will elect a secondary to be primary. By default, clients read from
the primary, however, clients can specify a :doc:`read preferences
</core/read-preference>` to send read operations to secondaries. See
:doc:`secondaries </core/replica-set-secondary>` for more information

.. include:: /images/replica-set-primary-with-two-secondaries.rst

You may add an extra :program:`mongod` instance a replica set as an
**arbiter**. Arbiters do not maintain a data set. Arbiters only exist
to vote in elections. If your replica set has an even number of
members, add an arbiter to obtain a majority of votes in an election
for primary. Arbiters do not require dedicated hardware. See
:doc:`arbiter </core/replica-set-arbiter>` for more information.

.. include:: /images/replica-set-primary-with-secondary-and-arbiter.rst

An **arbiter** will always be an arbiter. A **primary** may step
down and become a **secondary**. A **secondary** may become the
primary during an election.

Asynchronous Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Secondaries apply operations from the primary asynchronously. By
applying operations after the primary, sets can continue to function
without some members. However, as a result secondaries may not return
the most current data to clients.

See :ref:`replica-set-oplog` and :ref:`replica-set-sync`
for more information. See :ref:`replica-set-read-preference` for more on
read operations and secondaries.

Automatic Failover
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a primary does not communicate with the other members of the set
for more than 10 seconds, the replica set will attempt to
select another member to become the new primary. The first secondary
that receives a majority of the votes becomes primary.

Additional Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Replica sets provide a number of options to support application
needs. For example, you may deploy a replica set with :doc:`members in
multiple data centers
</core/replica-set-architecture-geographically-distributed>`, or
control the outcome of elections by adjusting the
:data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].priority` of some
members. Replica sets also support dedicated members for reporting,
disaster recovery, or backup functions.

See :ref:`replica-set-secondary-only-members`,
:ref:`replica-set-hidden-members` and
:ref:`replica-set-delayed-members` for more information.
