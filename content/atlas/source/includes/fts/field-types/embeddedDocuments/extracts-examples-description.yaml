  The following index definition indexes the array of objects in the
  ``products`` field. It also configures |fts| to automatically index all
  dynamically indexable fields inside the objects in the ``items``
  array.

ref: dynamic 
content: | 
  The following index definition configures |fts| to
  automatically index all dynamically indexable fields inside the
  objects in the ``items`` array. It also configures the
  ``purchaseMethod`` field to be indexed as
  :ref:`token <bson-data-types-token>`, which |fts| doesn't dynamically
  index, to support |fts| :ref:`fts-facet-ref` queries against that
  field.

ref: specified-fields 
content: |
  The following index definition configures |fts| to index only the
  ``name`` and ``tags`` fields as the |fts| ``string`` type in the
  ``items`` array of objects.

ref: stored-source-relative-path 
content: | 
  The following index definition automatically indexes all the fields in
  the ``funding_rounds`` array of objects for querying. It also uses the
  ``storedSource`` field to store the ``round_code``,
  ``raised_currency_code``, and ``raised_amount`` fields on ``mongot``.
  This allows you to query these stored fields using any operator that
  supports queries against these field types and retrieve these stored
  fields inside the parent object (``funding_rounds``) as individual
  documents. For a sample query that demonstrates this, see the :ref:`range-ref`
  :ref:`Embedded Documents Example <range-embedded-documents-eg>`. To query and
  retrieve other fields in the parent object (``funding_rounds``), you
  must use the ``embeddedDocument`` operator. 

---
ref: multiple-stored-source-configs 
content: | 
  The following index definition indexes all fields in the the
  ``products`` array of objects. It stores the ``name`` field
  independently for querying the ``name`` field and the ``products`` 
  array of objects. You can use any operator that supports queries
  against the field types in the ``products`` array of objects to query 
  and retrieve the stored fields as individual documents.
