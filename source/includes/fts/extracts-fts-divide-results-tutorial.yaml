  In this section, we run |fts| queries using the following:

  - :pipeline:`$skip` and :pipeline:`$limit` after the 
    :pipeline:`$search` stage to paginate the results.
  - :ref:`fts-facet-aggregation-variable` to return the total 
    number of search results in addition to paginating the 
    results.

  You can run one or all of the following queries against the collection  
  using the same index definition.
