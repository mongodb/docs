.. dbcommand:: shardCollection

   :ref:`Shards <sharding-background>` a collection to distribute its documents across
   shards. The :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command must be run against the
   ``admin`` database.

   .. note::

      .. versionchanged:: 6.0

      Starting in MongoDB 6.0, sharding a collection does **not** require you to
      first run the :dbcommand:`enableSharding` command to configure the database.

   .. |method| replace:: :method:`sh.shardCollection` 
      helper method
   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand-tip


Syntax
------

.. |command| replace:: :dbcommand:`shardCollection`

.. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand.rst

The command has the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   db.adminCommand(
      {
        shardCollection: "<database>.<collection>",
        key: { <field1>: <1|"hashed">, ... },
        unique: <boolean>,
        numInitialChunks: <integer>,
        presplitHashedZones: <boolean>,
        collation: { locale: "simple" },
        timeseries: <object>
      }
    )

Command Fields
--------------

The command takes the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80
 
   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
 
   * - ``shardCollection``
     - string
     - The :term:`namespace` of the collection to shard in the form
       ``<database>.<collection>``.
 
   * - ``key``
     - document
     - The document that specifies the field or fields to use as the
       :ref:`shard key <sharding-shard-key>`.
 
       ``{ <field1>: <1|"hashed">, ... }``
 
       Set the field values to either:
       
       - ``1`` for :doc:`ranged based sharding </core/ranged-sharding>`
       
       - ``"hashed"`` to specify a
         :ref:`hashed shard key <hashed-shard-keys>`.
       
       :ref:`shard key <sharding-shard-key>` must be
       supported by an index. Unless the collection is empty, the
       index must exist prior to the :dbcommand:`shardCollection`
       command. If the collection is empty, MongoDB creates the
       index prior to sharding the collection if the index that can
       support the shard key does not already exist.
       
       See also :ref:`sharding-shard-key-indexes`
 
   * - ``unique``
     - boolean
     - Specify ``true`` to ensure that the underlying index
       enforces a unique constraint. Defaults to ``false``. 
 
       You cannot specify ``true`` when using :ref:`hashed shard keys 
       <sharding-hashed>`.
 
   * - ``numInitialChunks``
     - integer
     - Specifies the initial number of chunks to create across all shards in 
       the cluster when sharding an *empty* collection with a
       :ref:`hashed shard key <sharding-hashed-sharding>`. MongoDB
       will then create and balance chunks across the cluster. The
       ``numInitialChunks`` must result in less than ``8192`` per shard.
       
       If the collection is not empty or the shard key does not
       contain a hashed field, the operation returns an error.
 
       - If sharding with :ref:`presplitHashedZones: true
         <cmd-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>`,
         MongoDB attempts to evenly distribute the specified
         number of chunks across the zones in the cluster.
 
       - If sharding with :ref:`presplitHashedZones: false
         <cmd-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>` or omitted and
         no zones and zone ranges are defined for the empty
         collection, MongoDB attempts to evenly distributed the
         specified number of chunks across the shards in the cluster.
 
       - If sharding with :ref:`presplitHashedZones: false
         <cmd-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>` or omitted and
         zones and zone ranges have been defined for the empty
         collection, ``numInitChunks`` has no effect.
 
       .. versionchanged:: 4.4
       
   * - ``collation``
     - document
     - Optional. If the collection specified to ``shardCollection``
       has a default :ref:`collation <collation>`, you *must* include a 
       collation document with ``{ locale : "simple" }``, or the 
       ``shardCollection`` command fails. At least one of the indexes
       whose fields support the shard key pattern must have the simple
       collation.
       
   * - :ref:`presplitHashedZones 
       <cmd-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>`
     - boolean
     - .. _cmd-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones:
     
       Optional. Specify ``true`` to perform initial chunk creation
       and distribution for an empty or non-existing collection based
       on the defined zones and zone ranges for the collection. For
       :ref:`hashed sharding <sharding-hashed>` only.
 
       ``shardCollection`` with ``presplitHashedZones: true`` returns
       an error if any of the following are true:
 
       - The shard key does not contain a hashed field 
         (i.e. is not a :ref:`single field hashed index 
         <index-hashed-index>` or :ref:`compound hashed index
         <index-type-compound-hashed>`).
 
       - The collection has no defined zones or zone ranges.
 
       - The defined zone range or ranges do not meet the 
         :ref:`requirements 
         <shardCollection-zones>`.

Time Series Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 5.1

To create a new :ref:`time series collection
<manual-timeseries-collection>` that is sharded, specify the
:ref:`timeseries <cmd-shard-collection-timeseries>` option to
:dbcommand:`shardCollection`.

The :ref:`timeseries <cmd-shard-collection-timeseries>` option takes
the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``timeField``
     - string
     - .. include:: /includes/time-series/fact-time-field-description.rst

   * - ``metaField``
     - string
     - .. include:: /includes/time-series/fact-meta-field-description.rst

   * - ``granularity``
     - string
     - .. include:: /includes/time-series/fact-granularity-description.rst

Considerations
--------------

Use
~~~

Do **not** run more than one :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command on
the same collection at the same time.

.. include:: /includes/fact-cannot-unshard-collection.rst

Shard Keys
~~~~~~~~~~

While you can :ref:`change your shard key <change-a-shard-key>`
later, it is important to carefully consider your shard key choice to
avoid scalability and perfomance issues.

.. include:: /includes/time-series/fact-shard-key-limitations.rst

.. _hashed-shard-keys:

Hashed Shard Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Hashed shard keys <sharding-hashed-sharding>` use a
:doc:`hashed index </core/index-hashed>` or a
:ref:`compound hashed index <index-type-compound-hashed>`
as the shard key.

Use the form ``field: "hashed"`` to specify a hashed shard key field.

.. _shardCollection-zones:

Zone Sharding and Initial Chunk Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/zoned-sharding-shard-operation-chunk-distribution-with-links.rst

See :ref:`pre-define-zone-range-example` for an example. If sharding a
collection using a ranged or single-field hashed shard key, the
``numInitialChunks`` option has no effect if zones and zone ranges have
been defined for the empty collection.

To shard a collection using a :ref:`compound hashed index
<index-type-compound-hashed>`, see
:ref:`shardCollection-zones-compound-hashed`.

.. _shardCollection-zones-compound-hashed:

Zone Sharding and Compound Hashed Indexes
`````````````````````````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/extracts/zoned-sharding-shard-operation-chunk-distribution-hashed-short.rst

The ``numInitialChunks`` option has no effect if zones and zone ranges
have been defined for the empty collection *and*
:ref:`presplitHashedZones <cmd-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>` is
``false``.

See :ref:`pre-define-zone-range-hashed-example` for an example.

Example
-------

The following operation enables sharding for the ``people`` collection
in the ``records`` database and uses the ``zipcode`` field as the
:ref:`shard key <shard-key>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { shardCollection: "records.people", key: { zipcode: 1 } } )
