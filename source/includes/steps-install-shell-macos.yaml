   Run the following command from the directory containing the
   ``mongosh`` ``.zip`` archive:
   
   .. code-block:: sh

      unzip mongosh-{+version+}-darwin-x64.zip

   The extracted ``bin`` folder contains two binaries: ``mongosh`` and
   ``mongosh_csfle_v1.dylib``.

   If your web browser automatically extracts the archive as part of the
   download or you extract the archive without the ``unzip`` command,
   you may need to make the binary executable. Run the following
   command from the directory where you extracted the archive:

   .. code-block:: sh

      chmod +x bin/mongosh

   that the developer could not be identified or verified, perform
   the following actions:

   a. Open *System Preferences*.
   
   #. Select the *Security and Privacy* pane.

   #. Under the *General* tab, click the button to the right of the
      message about ``mongosh``, labelled either :guilabel:`Open Anyway`
      or :guilabel:`Allow Anyway` depending on your version of macOS.
