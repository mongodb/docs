Build Indexes in the Background
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

By default, MongoDB builds indexes in the foreground, which means that
these no read and write operations to the database can occur while the
index builds. Also, no operations that need a read or write lock on all
databases (e.g. :command:`listDatabases`) can occur during this time as
well.

:ref:`Background index construction <index-creation-background>` allows
read and write operations to continue while building the index.

.. note::

   These index builds take longer to complete and result in a larger
   index.

After the index finishes building, MongoDB treats indexes built in the
background the same as any other index.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/core/indexes` and :doc:`/administration/indexes`
   for more information.

Procedure
---------

To create an index in the background, add the ``background`` argument
to the :method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()` operation, as in the
following index: 

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { a: 1 }, { background: true } )

Consider the section on :ref:`background index construction
<index-creation-background>` for more information about these indexes
and their implications.
