      * - ``caCertificate``
        - object
        - CA certificate used to verify the identify of the LDAP server.
          Self-signed certificates are allowed. Optional.

      * - ``authzQueryTemplate``
        - string
        - An LDAP query template that |service| executes to obtain the LDAP
          groups to which the authenticated user belongs. Used only for user authorization.
          Use the {USER} placeholder in the URL to substitute the authenticated

          The formatting for the query must conform to `RFC4515 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4515>`__
          and `RFC 4516 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4516>`_. If you

      :widths: 10 10 80
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Name
        - Type
        - Description

      * - ``ldap``
        - document
        - Specifies an LDAP configuration for a |service| project. Required.

      * - ``ldap.authenticationEnabled``
        - boolean
        - Specifies whether user authentication with LDAP is enabled.
          Required.

      * - ``ldap.authorizationEnabled``
        - boolean
        - Specifies whether user authorization with LDAP is enabled.
          You cannot enable user authorization with LDAP without first
          enabling user authentication with LDAP. Optional.

      * - ``ldap.hostname``
        - string
        - The hostname or IP address of the LDAP server. The server 
          must be visible to the internet or connected to your |service|
          cluster with :doc:`VPC Peering </security-vpc-peering>`.
          Required.

      * - ``ldap.port``
        - integer
        - The port to which the LDAP server listens for client connections.
          Required.  Default: ``636``.

      * - ``ldap.bindUsername``
        - string
        - The user DN that |service| uses to connect to the LDAP server.
          Must be the full DN, such as ``CN=BindUser,CN=Users,DC=myldapserver,DC=mycompany,DC=com``.
          Required.

      * - ``ldap.userToDNMapping``
        - document array
        - Maps an LDAP username for authentication to an LDAP Distinguished
          Name (DN). Each document contains a ``match`` regular expression 
          and either a ``substitution`` or ``ldapQuery`` template used to
          transform the LDAP username extracted from the regular expression.
          |service| steps through the each document in the array in the
          given order, checking the authentication username against the
          ``match`` filter. If a match is found, |service| applies the
          transformation and uses the output to authenticate the user. 
          |service| does not check the remaining documents in the array.
          See :setting:`security.ldap.userToDNMapping` for more information.

          The following example provides a ``match`` regular expression that
          matches all users and substitutes the username into the ``{0}``
          argument of the ``substitution`` template to create an LDAP DN.

          .. code-block:: json

             "userToDNMapping": [
               {
                "match":"(.*)",
                "substitution":"CN={0},CN=Users,DC=my-atlas-ldap-server,DC=myteam,DC=com"
               }
             ]

      * - ``ldap.userToDNMapping[i].match``
        - string
        - A regular expression to match against a provided LDAP username.
          Each parenthesis-enclosed section represents a `regular expression capture
          group <http://www.regular-expressions.info/refcapture.html>`_
          used by the ``substitution`` or ``ldapQuery`` template.


      * - ``ldap.userToDNMapping[i].substitution``
        - string
        - An LDAP Distinguished Name (DN) formatting template that converts
          the LDAP name matched by the ``match`` regular
          expression into an LDAP Distinguished Name. Each bracket-enclosed
          numeric value is replaced by the corresponding `regular expression capture
          group <http://www.regular-expressions.info/refcapture.html>`_
          extracted from the LDAP username that matched the
          ``match`` regular expression.

          Example:

          ``"substitution":"CN={0},CN=Users,DC=my-atlas-ldap-server,DC=myteam,DC=com"``

          Each document in the ``ldap.userToDNMapping.match`` array must
          contain either a ``substitution`` or ``ldapQuery`` field, but
          not both.
      * - ``ldap.userToDNMapping[i].ldapQuery``
        - string
        - An LDAP query formatting template that inserts the LDAP
          name matched by the ``match`` regular expression into an LDAP
          query URI as specified by `RFC 4515 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4515>`__
          and `RFC 4516 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4516>`_. Each 
          numeric value is replaced by the corresponding `regular expression
          capture group <http://www.regular-expressions.info/refcapture.html>`__
          extracted from the LDAP username that matched the
          ``match`` regular expression.

          Example:

          ``"ou=engineering,dc=example, dc=com??one?(user={0})"``


          Each document in the ``ldap.userToDNMapping.match`` array must
          contain either a ``substitution`` or ``ldapQuery`` field, but
          not both.
      * - ``bindPassword`` 
        - string
        - The password used to authenticate the ``bindUsername``. Required.

      * - ``caCertificate``
        - object
        - CA certificate used to verify the identify of the LDAP server.
          Self-signed certificates are allowed. Optional.

          .. tip::

             Pass an empty string to delete a previously assigned value:

             .. code-block:: json

                "caCertificate": ""

      * - ``authzQueryTemplate``
        - string
        - An LDAP query template that |service| executes to obtain the LDAP
          groups to which the authenticated user belongs. Used only for user authorization.
          Use the ``{USER}`` placeholder in the URL to substitute the authenticated
          username. The query is relative to the host specified with ``hostname``. 
          The formatting for the query must conform to `RFC4515 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4515>`__

          do not provide a query template, |service| attempts to use the
          default value: ``{USER}?memberOf?base``. Optional.

             Pass an empty string to delete a previously assigned value:
