Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to use the {+driver-short+} to monitor the
driver's connection pool. A connection pool is a set of open
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections that your driver
maintains with a MongoDB instance. Connection pools help reduce the
number of new connections your application needs to create,
which might make your application run faster.

You might use information about connection pool events in your
application to optimize performance or understand the client lifecycle.

Subscribe to Events
-------------------

You can access details about connection pool events by subscribing to them
in your application. The following example demonstrates how to subscribe
to the ``PoolEvent`` event by instantiating a
``PoolMonitor`` and connecting to a deployment:

.. code-block:: go

   var eventArray []*event.PoolEvent
   cxnMonitor := &event.PoolMonitor{
       Started: func(e *event.PoolEvent) {
           eventArray = append(eventArray, e)
       },
   }
   clientOpts := options.Client().ApplyURI(uri).SetPoolMonitor(cxnMonitor)
   client, err := mongo.Connect(clientOpts)

Event Descriptions
------------------

The following table describes the types of pool events that the driver
emits:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33 67
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Pool Event Type
     - Description

   * - ``ConnectionPoolCreated``
     - Created when a connection pool is created.

   * - ``ConnectionPoolReady``
     - Created when a connection pool is ready.

   * - ``ConnectionPoolCleared``
     - Created when all the connections in the pool are closed.

   * - ``ConnectionPoolClosed``
     - Created when a connection pool is closed, before the destruction of
       the server instance.

   * - ``ConnectionCreated``
     - Created when a connection is created, but not necessarily
       when it is used for an operation.

   * - ``ConnectionReady``
     - Created after a connection completes a
       handshake and is ready to be used for operations.

   * - ``ConnectionClosed``
     - Created when a connection is closed.

   * - ``ConnectionCheckOutStarted``
     - Created when an operation attempts to acquire a connection for
       execution.

   * - ``ConnectionCheckOutFailed``
     - Created when an operation cannot acquire a connection for
       execution.

   * - ``ConnectionCheckedOut``
     - Created when an operation successfully acquires a connection for
       execution.

   * - ``ConnectionCheckedIn``
     - Created when a connection is checked back into the pool after an operation
       is executed.
