  These code examples perform the following tasks:

  - Imports ``mongodb``, MongoDB's Node.js driver.
  - Creates an instance of the ``MongoClient`` class to establish a 
    connection to your |service| cluster.
  - Iterates over the cursor to print the documents that match the 
    query.

  |fts| query results vary based on the type of word mapping defined in 
  the synonyms source collection.

        a. Create a file named ``synonyms-equivalent-query.js``. 
        #. Copy and paste the code example into the 
           ``synonyms-equivalent-query.js`` file.

           The code example contains the following stages:
           
           - :pipeline:`$search` stage to search the ``title`` field 
             for the word ``automobile`` and uses the synonym mapping 
             definition named ``transportSynonyms`` to search for words 
             configured as synonyms of the query word ``automobile`` in 
             the synonyms source collection named 
             ``transport_synonyms``. 
           - :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the output to 10 
             results. 
           - :pipeline:`$project` stage to exclude all fields except 
             ``title`` and add a field named ``score``.
