You should plan to migrate from LDAP to an alternative authentication
method.

Full LDAP migration information will be available in the future.

Details
-------

The following sections introduce alternative authentication methods for
self-managed MongoDB Enterprise Advanced, MongoDB Atlas, and MongoDB
Atlas for Government.

Self-Managed MongoDB Enterprise Advanced
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For human user access, MongoDB recommends migrating from LDAP to
Workforce Identity Federation (OIDC authentication). Workforce Identity
Federation allows single sign-on (SSO) access to your self-managed
MongoDB databases using any identity provider that supports OIDC, such
as Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), Microsoft
Entra ID, Okta, and Ping Identity. 

For programmatic users, MongoDB recommends migrating from LDAP to
Workload Identity Federation. With Workload Identity Federation, your
applications can use databases with OAuth 2.0 access tokens provided by
your authorization service.

You can also use cloud provider principals such as Microsoft Azure
Managed Identities and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service accounts. If
you cannot use Workload Identity Federation, MongoDB recommends you use
X.509 certificate authentication.

- To configure Workforce Identity Federation (OIDC authentication) with
  the MongoDB server, see :ref:`<configure-oidc>`.
- To configure Workload Identity Federation (OAuth2.0) with the MongoDB 
  server, see :ref:`<configure-mongodb-workload>`.
- To configure Workforce and Workload Identity Federation with MongoDB
  Cloud Manager, see :mms-docs:`Enable Authentication and Authorization
  with Cloud Manager </tutorial/enable-oidc-authentication-for-group>`.

- To configure Workforce and Workload Identity Federation with MongoDB
  Ops Manager, see :opsmgr:`Enable Authentication and Authorization
  with Ops Manager </tutorial/enable-oidc-authentication-for-group>`.

Some of the advantages of Workforce and Workload Identity Federation
compared to LDAP for a self-managed MongoDB deployment are:

- **No credentials stored in MongoDB:** The LDAP bind user credentials
  are stored in MongoDB. With Workforce or Workload Identity Federation,
  MongoDB doesn't store credentials or secrets that grant access to user
  directories.

- **Reduced cross-application risk:** In an LDAP connection, the user's
  LDAP credentials are sent to MongoDB within the connection string,
  which is a risk for cross-application access. However, with Workforce
  and Workload Identity Federation, MongoDB never receives a secret.
  OIDC and OAuth 2.0 grant access tokens for specific resources using
  audience claims. If a token is compromised, the token cannot be used
  to access other applications.

- **Improved security with access tokens:** Identity Federation grants
  access through short term access tokens, which improves security when
  compared to LDAP. Access tokens are typically valid for one hour. The
  time period can usually be customized based on the identity provider.

- **Authentication without passwords for application users:** If your
  applications are running in the cloud, Workload Identity Federation
  supports authentication without passwords for applications running on
  :atlas:`specific cloud resources
  </workload-oidc/#built-in-authentication>`. This eliminates
  periodically renewing credentials.

MongoDB Atlas and Atlas for Government
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For human user access, MongoDB recommends migrating from LDAP to
Workforce Identity Federation (OIDC authentication). Workforce Identity
Federation allows single sign-on (SSO) access to your Atlas clusters
with any identity provider that supports OIDC, such as Microsoft Entra
ID, Okta, and Ping Identity.

For programmatic users, MongoDB recommends migrating from LDAP to Amazon
AWS-IAM authentication or Workload Identity Federation. If your
applications are running on AWS resources, you can use AWS-IAM
authentication to access your MongoDB Atlas clusters with AWS-IAM roles.

If your applications are running on Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud
Platform systems, you can use Workload Identity Federation to
access Atlas clusters with Microsoft Azure Managed Identities or Google
Cloud Platform Service Accounts. If you cannot use AWS-IAM or Workload
Identity Federation, MongoDB recommends using X.509 certificate
authentication.

- To get started with Workforce and Workload Identity Federation,
  see :atlas:`Authentication and Authorization with OIDC/OAuth 2.0 in
  Atlas </security-oidc/>`.
- To get started with AWS-IAM authentication, see :atlas:`Set Up
  Authentication with AWS-IAM </security/aws-iam-authentication/>`.

Some of the advantages of Workforce and Workload Identity Federation
compared to LDAP in Atlas are:

- **Improved network security:** LDAP requires a public Fully Qualified
  Domain Name (FQDN), which creates a potential firewall vulnerability.
  With Workforce Identity Federation, you can use an Internet connected
  Identity Provider (IdP) and synchronize part of the user directory to
  your IdP to improve security with Workforce Identity Federation.
- **Improved credentials handling:** Unlike LDAP, user credentials
  aren't sent to or stored in MongoDB when using Workforce or Workload
  Identity Federation.
- **Modern authentication policies for human users:** Workforce Identity
  Federation allows authentication through IdP, which enables the use of
  modern authentication policies.
- **Simple configuration:** LDAP users require a complex network
  configuration for Atlas. Identity Federation has a simpler
  configuration.
- **Improved security with access tokens:** Workforce and Workload
  Identity Federation and AWS-IAM authentication grant access through
  short term access tokens, which improves security when compared to
  LDAP. Access tokens are typically valid for one hour. The time period
  can usually be customized based on the identity provider.
- **Authentication without passwords for application users:** Workload
  Identity Federation supports authentication without passwords for
  applications running on :atlas:`specific cloud resources
  </workload-oidc/#built-in-authentication>`. This eliminates
  periodically renewing credentials.
- **Cost efficiency:** For Atlas Developer and Pro support, LDAP has a
  fee as part of the Advanced Security package. Workforce and Workload
  Identity Federation don't have an additional fee. For pricing, see:
