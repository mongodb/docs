.. note:: New Bulk Write Command in MongoDB 8.0

   Starting in MongoDB 8.0, you can use the :method:`Mongo.bulkWrite()`
   ``mongosh`` method to perform bulk writes across multiple databases and
   collections. To learn more about different bulk write methods and commands,
   see :ref:`bulk-write-operations`.

Definition
----------

.. method:: db.collection.bulkWrite()

   Performs multiple write operations on **one** collection, with controls for 
   order of execution.

   :returns:
      - A boolean ``acknowledged`` as ``true`` if the operation ran with
        :term:`write concern` or ``false`` if write concern was disabled.
      - A count for each write operation.
      - An array containing an ``_id`` for each successfully inserted or
        upserted documents.

Compatibility
-------------

.. |operator-method| replace:: ``db.collection.bulkWrite()``

|operator-method| is available in deployments hosted in the following environments:

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-all.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

.. note::

   You can't perform :ref:`bulk write <bulk-write-operations>` 
   operations in the :ref:`Atlas UI <atlas-ui-docs>`. 
   To insert multiple documents, you must insert an array of documents.
   To learn more, see :ref:`atlas-ui-docs` in the Atlas documentation. 

Syntax
------

The :method:`~db.collection.bulkWrite()` method has the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.bulkWrite(
       [ <operation 1>, <operation 2>, ... ],
       {
         writeConcern : <document>,
         ordered : <boolean>
       }
   )

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``bulkWrite()`` method takes the following
parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``operations``
     - array
     - An array of ``bulkWrite()`` write
       operations.

       Valid operations are:

       .. hlist::
          :columns: 2

          - :ref:`insertOne <bulkwrite-write-operations-insertOne>`
          - :ref:`updateOne <bulkwrite-write-operations-updateOneMany>`
          - :ref:`updateMany <bulkwrite-write-operations-updateOneMany>`
          - :ref:`deleteOne <bulkwrite-write-operations-deleteOneMany>`
          - :ref:`deleteMany <bulkwrite-write-operations-deleteOneMany>`
          - :ref:`replaceOne <bulkwrite-write-operations-replaceOne>`

       See :ref:`bulkwrite-write-operations` for usage of each operation

   * - ``writeConcern``
     - document
     - Optional. A document expressing the :ref:`write concern
       <write-concern>`. Omit to use the default write concern.
 
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-operations-write-concern.rst

   * - ``ordered``
     - boolean
     - Optional. A boolean specifying whether operations execute serially (``true``,
       the default) or may execute in any order (``false``). When ``true``, stops
       on the first error; when ``false``, continues processing remaining operations.

Behavior
--------

``bulkWrite()`` takes an array of write operations and
executes each of them. By default operations are executed in order.
See :ref:`bulkwrite-write-operations-executionofoperations` for controlling
the order of write operation execution.

     - Optional. Specifies the :ref:`collation <collation>` to use for
       the operation.


.. _bulkwrite-write-operations-id:


``_id`` Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the document does not specify an :term:`_id` field, then :binary:`~bin.mongod`
adds the ``_id`` field and assign a unique
:method:`ObjectId` for the document before inserting or upserting it.
Most drivers create an ObjectId and insert the ``_id`` field, but the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` will create and populate the ``_id`` if the driver or
application does not.

If the document contains an ``_id`` field, the ``_id`` value must be
unique within the collection to avoid duplicate key error.

Update or replace operations cannot specify an ``_id`` value that differs
from the original document.

.. _bulkwrite-write-operations-executionofoperations:

Execution of Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``ordered`` parameter controls whether operations execute serially or in any order.

With ``ordered : true`` (default), operations execute serially. If an error occurs,
subsequent operations are not executed.

With ``ordered : false``, operations may execute in parallel. All operations without
errors are completed even if some operations fail.

.. include:: /includes/fact-bulkwrite-operation-batches.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-bulk-operation-sharded-cluster.rst

Capped Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``bulkWrite()`` has restrictions on :term:`capped collections <capped collection>`:

- ``updateOne`` and ``updateMany`` throw a ``WriteError`` if the update increases
  the document size.
- ``replaceOne`` throws a ``WriteError`` if the replacement document is larger than
  the original.
- ``deleteOne`` and ``deleteMany`` throw a ``WriteError`` on capped collections.

.. |operation| replace:: ``bulkWrite()``

.. _bulkWrite-error-handling:

Error Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``bulkWrite()`` throws a ``BulkWriteError``
exception on errors. See :ref:`bulkwrite-error-handling-txn`.

Excluding :ref:`write concern <write-concern>` errors, ordered operations
stop after an error, while unordered operations continue to process any
remaining write operations in the queue, unless when run inside a
transaction. See :ref:`bulkwrite-error-handling-txn`.

Write concern errors are displayed in the ``writeConcernErrors`` field, while
all other errors are displayed in the ``writeErrors`` field. If an error is
encountered, the number of successful write operations are displayed instead
of the inserted ``_id`` values. Ordered operations display the single error
encountered while unordered operations display each error in an array.

Schema Validation Errors
++++++++++++++++++++++++

If your collection uses :ref:`schema validation
<schema-validation-overview>` and has ``validationAction`` set to 
``error``, inserting an invalid document or updating a document with
invalid values throws an error. Operations preceding the invalid 
operation in the ``operations`` array are executed and written to the 
collection. The ``ordered`` field determines if the remaining 
operations are executed.

Transactions

Examples
--------

.. _bulkwrite-example-bulk-write-operation:

.. include:: /includes/sample-data-usage.rst

.. _bulkwrite-example-unordered-bulk-write:

Unordered Bulk Write Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To specify an unordered ``bulkWrite()``, set
``ordered`` to ``false``.

In an unordered ``bulkWrite()`` list of operations:

- Operations can run in parallel (not guaranteed). For details. See
  :ref:`bulk-write-operations-ordered-vs-unordered`.
- Operations with errors are not completed.
- All operations without errors are completed.

In the following example:

- :method:`~db.collection.bulkWrite()` runs unordered operations on
  the ``users`` collection.
- The second ``insertOne`` operation, which is commented out, has the same ``_id`` as the first
  ``insertOne``, which causes a duplicate key error.

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/command-line/mongosh/bulkWrite/insert-error.js
   :language: javascript
   :category: usage example

The second ``insertOne`` operation fails because of the duplicate key
error. In an unordered ``bulkWrite()``, MongoDB completes any
operation without an error.

Write Concern Errors in Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |cmd| replace:: ``bulkWrite()``
.. include:: /includes/fact-update-writeConcernError-mongos.rst

.. _bulkwrite-example-bulk-write-with-write-concern:

Bulk Write with Write Concern Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following :method:`~db.collection.bulkWrite()` example runs
operations on the ``users`` collection and sets a ``"majority"``
:ref:`write concern <wc-w>` with a 100 millisecond :ref:`timeout
<wc-wtimeout>`:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/command-line/mongosh/bulkWrite/majority-write-concern.js
   :language: javascript
   :category: usage example

If the time for the majority of replica set members to acknowledge the
operations exceeds ``wtimeout``, the example returns a write concern
error and a summary of completed operations.
