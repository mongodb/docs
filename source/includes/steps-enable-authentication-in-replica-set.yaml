title: Shut down all members of the replica set.
ref: shutdown-repset
level: 4
pre: |
  Shut down each :program:`mongod` in the replica set, starting with the 
  :term:`secondaries<secondary>`. Continue until *all* members of the 
  replica set are offline, including any :term:`arbiters<arbiter>`. 
  The :term:`primary` must be the *last* member shut down to avoid 
  potential rollbacks.

  To shut down a :program:`mongod`, connect each :program:`mongod` using a
  :program:`mongo` shell and issue the :method:`db.shutdownServer()` on the 
  ``admin`` database:
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    use admin
    db.shutdownServer()
post: |
  At the end of this step, *all* members of the replica set should be offline.

title: Restart each member of the replica set with access control enforced. 
ref: enable-auth
level: 4
source:
  file: steps-deploy-replica-set-with-auth.yaml
  ref: deploy-repset-start-members
pre: |
  Running a :program:`mongod` with the ``keyFile`` parameter enforces both 
  :doc:`/core/security-internal-authentication` and 
  :doc:`/core/authorization`.

  Start *each* :program:`mongod` in the replica set using either 
  a configuration file or the command line.
  
  Use the original replica set name for ``replSetName`` when starting each 
  member. You cannot change the name of a replica set, and attempting to do 
  so results in errors.

stepnum: 5
level: 4
ref: connect-via-localhost
pre: |
  Connect a :program:`mongo` shell to one of the config server
  :program:`mongod` instances over the :ref:`localhost
  interface<localhost-exception>`. You must run the :program:`mongo`
  shell on the same physical machine as the :program:`mongod` instance.

  Use :method:`rs.status()` to identify the :term:`primary` replica set
  member. If you are connected to the primary, continue to the next step. If
  not, identify the primary :program:`mongod` and connect to it using a
  :program:`mongo` shell over the :ref:`localhost
  interface<localhost-exception>`.

  You must connect using the :ref:`localhost interface <localhost-exception>` 
  because no users have been created for the deployment. After creating 
  the first user, you must authenticate using that user to proceed regardless
  of how you are connected to the :program:`mongod`.
  
  .. important:: You must connect to the :term:`primary` before proceeding.
