Tag Aware Sharding
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

For sharded clusters, MongoDB makes it possible to associate specific
ranges of a :term:`shard key` with a specific :term:`shard` or subset
of shards. This association dictates the policy of the cluster
balancer process as it balances the :term:`chunks <chunk>` around the
cluster. This capability enables the following deployment patterns:

- isolating a specific subset of data on specific set of shards.

- controlling the balancing policy so that, in a geographically
  distributed cluster, the most relevant portions of the data set
  reside on the shards with the greatest proximity to the application
  servers.

This document describes the behavior, operation, and use of tag aware
sharding in MongoDB deployments.

.. note::

   Shard key range tags are entirely distinct from :ref:`replica set member
   tags <replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>`.

:term:`Hash-based sharding <hashed shard key>` does not support
tag-aware sharding.

Behavior and Operations
-----------------------

Tags in a sharded cluster are pieces of metadata that dictate the
policy and behavior of the cluster :term:`balancer`. Using
tags, you may associate individual shards in a cluster with one or
more tags. Then, you can assign this tag string to a range
of :term:`shard key` values for a sharded collection. When migrating a
chunk, the balancer will select a destination shard based on the
configured tag ranges.

The balancer migrates chunks in tagged ranges to shards with those
tags, if tagged shards are not balanced. [#specific-tagged-migrations]_

.. note::

   Because a single chunk may span different tagged shard key ranges,
   the balancer may migrate chunks to tagged shards that contain
   values that exceed the upper bound of the selected tag range.

.. example::

   Given a sharded collection with two configured tag ranges, such
   that:

   - :term:`Shard key` values between ``100`` and ``200`` have tags to
     direct corresponding chunks to shards tagged ``NYC``.

   - Shard Key values between ``200`` and ``300`` have tags to direct
     corresponding chunks to shards tagged ``SFO``.

   In this cluster, the balancer will migrate a chunk with shard key
   values ranging between ``150`` and ``220`` to a shard tagged
   ``NYC``, since ``150`` is closer to ``200`` than ``300``.

After configuring tags on the shards and ranges of the shard key, the
cluster may take some time to reach the proper distribution of data,
depending on the division of chunks (i.e. splits) and the current
distribution of data in the cluster. Once configured, the balancer
will respect tag ranges during future :ref:`balancing rounds
<sharding-internals-balancing>`.

.. [#specific-tagged-migrations] To migrate chunks in a tagged
   environment, the balancer selects a target shard with a tag range
   that has an *upper* bound that is *greater than* the migrating
   chunk's *lower* bound. If a shard with a matching tagged range
   exists, the balancer will migrate the chunk to that shard.
