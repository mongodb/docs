  Deploy one machine for each :program:`mongod` instance. A
  :program:`mongos` instance requires minimal resources and can run on the
  same machine as a :program:`mongod`.

  Give the servers a common prefix in order to specify them as a group
  when deploying new clusters or replica sets.

  The :ref:`security group <security-group>` must allow traffic on
  the ports you use for your deployment. The security
  groups populated here come directly from your AWS account. |mms|
  cannot create a new security group: if you would like a new group
  listed in this menu, you must create it in the AWS console.

  Select the SSH key to use when connecting to the server from the command
  line. To select an SSH key, you must have at least one public key stored
  in your :ref:`AWS Settings <aws-settings-page>`.

  When make all of your selections, click :guilabel:`NEXT`.

  Select a :guilabel:`Root Volume Size (GiB)` large enough for the
  deployment's needs. We recommend a root volume of at least 25 GB.
  The root volume stores the operating system, the downloaded MongoDB
  versions, and the Automation Agent log files.

  In the :guilabel:`Data Directory` field, enter the path MongoDB will use
  to store data, and in the :guilabel:`Location of Data` field select
  which volume holds the data. We do not recommend storing your data on
  the Root Volume. For machines in the ``m1`` or ``m2`` series, we
  recommend attaching an EBS Volume. For machines in the ``c3`` series, we
  recommend storing the data on the SSD instance stores.

  When you finish modifying the settings, click :guilabel:`PROVISION MACHINE`.

  The systems may not be fully operational for several minutes.
