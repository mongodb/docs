.. pipeline:: $externalFunction

The :pipeline:`$externalFunction` stage triggers processes in a specific AWS 
Lambda resource. Your request to the AWS Lambda process can either be synchronous 
or asynchronous. 

Create an AWS Lambda and Authenticate with Unified AWS Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to call an AWS Lambda resource from within your {+atlas-sp+} pipeline, 
your AWS Lambda must be deployed to the same AWS region in which your {+atlas-sp+} 
is deployed. To learn more about deploying an AWS Lambda resource, see the 
`AWS documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/>`__.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Create an AWS Lambda Function.
      
      With either the AWS CLI or through the AWS UI, `create a lambda function <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html>`__.

      .. note:: 

        - AWS Lambda resources must be created with an ``AWS_IAM`` authentication type,
          which requires that you create an AWS IAM `Role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html>`__ 
          and `Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html>`__. 
        - Only the buffered, not streaming, response type is supported.

   .. step:: Configure Unified AWS Access.

      .. note:: 

         The procedure described here only covers the basic setup flow in the {+atlas-ui+}. 
         To learn more, see the the :ref:`Set Up Unified AWS Access <set-up-unified-aws-access>` 
         documentation.

      **Required Access**

      To set up unified |aws| access, you must have
      :authrole:`Organization Owner` or :authrole:`Project Owner` access to
      the project.

      **Prerequisites**

      - An |service| :doc:`account </index>`.
      - The `AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html>`__.

      .. note:: 

         - Your AWS IAM policy must include the ``lambda:InvokeFunction`` action.
         - You must replace the placeholder ``ExternalId`` and ``Resource`` values 
           with your own, which are available through the Unified AWS Access 
           configuration process. Note that the ``ExternalId`` in this example 
           includes a wildcard that matches any Lambda Function with a name that 
           begins with ``function-``. 

   .. step:: Add Trust Relationships to an Existing Role in the {+atlas-ui+}

      Next, you must enable your self-managed AWS IAM role to execute your AWS 
      Lambda resource. 

      ``permission-policy.json``

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/atlas-stream-processing/permission-policy.json

      1. Navigate to the AWS IAM integration page in your Atlas project and click on the 
         :guilabel:`Authorize an AWS IAM role` button.
      #. Create a new role (or modify an existing role) with the ``role-trust-policy.json`` 
         that is shown in the modal.
      #. Once the role is created (or the existing role is updated with the new 
         trust policy), paste the role's ARN in the modal.
      #. In the AWS console, go to :guilabel:`IAM` > :guilabel:`Roles` and 
         select your role.
      #. In the :guilabel:`permissions` tab, add a new "inline permission" to 
         allow this role to invoke your lambda(s). The example ``permission-policy.json`` 
         provided above adds the permission to run any lambda with the name ``<function-name>``.
      #. Finally, navigate to your {+atlas-sp+} Workspace, add a new :guilabel:`AWS Lambda connection` 
         and choose the :guilabel:`AWS IAM Role ARN` that you configured in the previous step.

Connect your {+atlas-sp+} Workspace to your AWS Lambda Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to send a request to your AWS Lambda resource from within your {+atlas-sp+} 
pipeline, you must first add your AWS Lambda resource as a :ref:`connection <atlas-sp-manage-connections>` 
in your {+atlas-sp+} resource. 

.. include:: /includes/atlas-stream-processing/add-external-function-connection.rst

Syntax
~~~~~~

Minimal request
```````````````
The following example shows the required fields for a minimal request.

.. code-block:: json

   { $externalFunction: {
     connectionName: "myLambdaConnection",
     functionName: "arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:function-name",
     as: "response",
   }}

Customized request
```````````````````
The following, customized example specifies error handling, synchronous execution 
and a preprocessed {+atlas-sp+} document as a payload in addition to the required 
fields illustrated above.

.. code-block:: json

   { $externalFunction: {
	   connectionName: "myLambdaConnection",
	   functionName: "arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:function-name",
	   execution: "sync"
	   as: "response",
	   onError: "fail",
	   payload: [{$replaceRoot: { newRoot: "$fullDocument.payloadToSend" } }, { $addFields: { sum: { $sum: "$randomArray" }}}, { $project: { success: 1, sum: 1 }}],
   }}

.. note:: 

   The ``onError`` field defines behavior for API level errors for both 
   synchronous and asynchronous requests to your AWS Lambda resource as well as 
   AWS Lambda function errors for synchronous requests.

The ``$externalFunction`` stage takes a document with the following fields: 

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 15 15 45

   * - Field 
     - Type 
     - Necessity 
     - Description

   * - ``connectionName`` 
     - string
     - Required
     - Label that identifies the connection in the
       :ref:`Connection Registry <atlas-sp-manage-connections>`, to which
       the request is sent.

   * - ``functionName``
     - string
     - Required
     - The full AWS ARN or the name of the AWS Lambda function to be triggered. 

   * - ``execution``
     - enum
     - Optional 
     - Parameter that specifies whether the AWS Lambda function should be called 
       synchronously or asynchronously. Accepted values are:
       
       - ``sync``
       - ``async`` 

       Defaults to ``sync``, which is required if remaining stages in your 
       {+atlas-sp+} pipeline require the output from your AWS Lambda function.

   * - ``as``
     - string
     - Optional
     - Name of the field for the REST API response.

       If the endpoint returns 0 bytes, the operator doesn't set the ``as`` field.

   * - ``onError``
     - string
     - Optional
     - Behavior when the operator encounters an  ``HTTPS Status Code`` or Lambda Runtime-related
       failure. Must be one of the following values:

       - ``"dlq"`` : Pass the affected document to the :term:`dead letter queue`.
       - ``"ignore"`` : Do nothing with the affected document.
       - ``"fail"`` : Terminate the stream processor on error.

       ``onError`` does not trigger on errors arising from incorrect
       configuration of the ``$externalFunction`` operator itself, such as invalid 
       expressions.

       Defaults to ``"dlq"``.

   * - ``payload``
     - array
     - Optional
     - Custom inner pipeline that allows you to customize the request body sent to the API endpoint. 
       ``payload`` supports the following expressions:

       - ``$project``
       - ``$addFields``
       - ``$replaceRoot``
       - ``$set``

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

The :pipeline:`$externalFunction` stage sends a request to the specified AWS Lambda
resource. If the request is synchronous, the response is returned in the specified field
and the pipeline continues processing. If the request is asynchronous, the
pipeline continues processing without waiting for the response.

If a synchronous request fails, the pipeline's error handling behavior is determined 
by the ``onError`` field. If the request is asynchronous, the ``onError`` field 
only applied to AWS API errors, as opposed to AWS Lambda function errors. If the 
``onError`` field is not specified, the default behavior is to send the affected
document to the :term:`dead letter queue`. 

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - ``onError`` Value
     - Behavior

   * - ``"dlq"``
     - The affected document is sent to the dead letter queue.

   * - ``"ignore"``
     - The affected document is ignored.

   * - ``"fail"``
     - The stream processor is terminated on error.

If the pipeline can't convert the document to proper JSON, or the configured 
pipeline does not create a valid bson object as a product of the final stage, 
the document is sent to the :term:`dead letter queue` regardless of the 
``onError`` setting.

Errors arising from incorrect configuration of the ``$externalFunction`` operator 
itself, such as invalid expressions, do not trigger the ``onError`` behavior. 
Instead, the stream processor fails with an error message. The {+atlas-sp+} pipeline 
retries failed requests that may be the result of transient errors.
