The `MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes>`__
creates |k8s| |k8s-statefulsets| from specification files that you
wrote.

MongoDB resources are created in Kubernetes as `custom resources <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/>`__.
After you create or update a MongoDB resource specification, you direct
|k8s-op-full| to apply this specification to your |k8s| environment.
|k8s-op-short| creates the defined |k8s-statefulsets|, services and
other Kubernetes resources. After the Operator finishes creating those
objects, it updates Ops Manager deployment configuration to reflect
changes.

     - 1
     - 1 per member

   * - Sharded Cluster

     - 1 per shard or config server member

Each |k8s-obj| uses an |k8s-obj| specification in
:abbr:`YAML (Yet Another Markup Language)` to define the characteristics and settings of the MongoDB object: standalone, :term:`replica set`,
and :term:`sharded cluster`.

Common Resource Settings
------------------------

Every resource type must use the following settings:

Required
~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/option/setting-k8sSaConf-apiVersion.rst
.. include:: /includes/option/setting-k8sSaConf-kind.rst
.. include:: /includes/option/setting-k8sSaConf-metadata.name.rst
.. include:: /includes/option/setting-k8sSaConf-metadata.namespace.rst
.. include:: /includes/option/setting-k8sSaConf-spec.credentials.rst
.. include:: /includes/option/setting-k8sSaConf-spec.persistent.rst
.. include:: /includes/option/setting-k8sSaConf-spec.project.rst
.. include:: /includes/option/setting-k8sSaConf-spec.type.rst
.. include:: /includes/option/setting-k8sSaConf-spec.version.rst

Optional
~~~~~~~~

Every resource type may use the following settings:

.. include:: /includes/option/setting-k8sSaConf-spec.clusterName.rst
.. include:: /includes/option/setting-k8sSaConf-spec.service.rst
.. include:: /includes/option/setting-k8sSaConf-spec.logLevel.rst

Deployment-Specific Resource Settings
-------------------------------------

Other settings you can and must use in a |k8s-mdbrsc| specification depend upon which MongoDB deployment item you want to create.
