==================
Use MMS Public API
==================

Overview
--------

The MMS public API follows the principles of the REST architectural style to
expose a number of internal resources which enable programmatic access to MMS's
features. This document describes the procedure for getting started
with the MMS public API.

Considerations
--------------

You can have up to ten keys associated to your account. Each key can be
either enabled or disabled, but be aware that they both count towards the
ten key limit.

API Keys are associated to a user and therefore have the same level of
access as that user.

Procedure
---------

You must have the :ref:`Group Owner <group-owner-role>` role to enable the
public API.

Additional Information

See the :doc:`/core/api` for a background on the use and operation of the MMS
public API, and :doc:`/reference/api` for a complete reference of all
resources available in the MMS public API.
