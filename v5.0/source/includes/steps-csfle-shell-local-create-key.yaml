  Configuring client-side field level encryption for a locally-managed
  key requires specifying a base64-encoded 96-byte string with no line
  breaks.
  
  To mitigate the risk of these credentials leaking into logs, the
  following procedure passes the values into :binary:`~bin.mongosh`
  using environment variables.

  The following operation generates a key that meets the stated
  requirements and adds it to the user's ``~/.profile``. If the key
  ``DEV_LOCAL_KEY`` already exists, skip this operation.

  .. code-block:: bash

      echo "export DEV_LOCAL_KEY=\"$(head -c 96 /dev/urandom | base64 | tr -d '\n')\"" >> ~/.profile

  The host operating system may require logging out and back in to
  refresh the loaded environment variables. Alternatively, you can use
  the command ``source ~/.profile`` to manually refresh the shell.

  .. note::

      Your specific host operating system or shell may have different
      procedures for setting persistent environment variables. Defer to
      the documentation for your host OS or shell for a more specific
      procedure as appropriate.

  Create a :binary:`~bin.mongosh` session using the :option:`--eval
  <mongosh --eval>`, :option:`--shell <mongosh --shell>`, and
  :option:`--nodb <mongosh --nodb>` options:

  .. code-block:: bash

      mongosh --eval "var LOCAL_KEY = '$DEV_LOCAL_KEY' " \
        --shell --nodb

  The example automatically opens :binary:`~bin.mongosh`
  without a connection to a MongoDB database. The ``--eval``
  option sets the ``LOCAL_KEY`` variable in :binary:`~bin.mongosh`
  to the value of the corresponding environment variable.

  In :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, create a new
  :ref:`ClientSideFieldLevelEncryptionOptions` variable for storing the
  client-side field level encryption configuration document:

  .. code-block:: javascript

      var ClientSideFieldLevelEncryptionOptions = {
        "keyVaultNamespace" : "encryption.__dataKeys",
        "kmsProviders" : {
          "local" : {
            "key" : BinData(0, LOCAL_KEY)
          }
        }
      }

  In :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, use the :method:`Mongo()<Mongo()>`
  constructor to establish a database connection to the target cluster.
  Specify the :ref:`ClientSideFieldLevelEncryptionOptions` document as
  the second parameter to the :method:`Mongo()<Mongo()>` constructor to
  configure the connection for client-side field level encryption:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     csfleDatabaseConnection = Mongo(
       "mongodb://replaceMe.example.net:27017/?replicaSet=myMongoCluster",
       ClientSideFieldLevelEncryptionOptions
     )

  Replace the ``replaceMe.example.net`` :ref:`URI <mongodb-uri>` with
  the connection string for the target cluster.

  Use the ``csfleDatabaseConnection`` object to access 
  :doc:`client-side field level encryption
  </reference/method/js-client-side-field-level-encryption>` shell
  methods.

  For complete documentation on establishing database connections 
  configured for client-side field level encryption, see the 
  :method:`Mongo()` constructor reference.

title: "Create the Key Vault Object."
ref: create-keyvault-object
level: 4
content: |

  Use the :method:`getKeyVault()` method on the
  ``csfleDatabaseConnection`` database connection object to create the 
  ``keyVault`` object:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     keyVault = csfleDatabaseConnection.getKeyVault();

  .. important::

     Client-side field level encryption depends on server-enforced
     uniqueness of key alternate names. :method:`getKeyVault()`
     creates a :ref:`unique index <index-type-unique>` on 
     ``keyAltNames`` if one does not exist. Do **not** drop the
     :ref:`unique index <index-type-unique>` created by
     :method:`getKeyVault()`.

title: "Create the Data Encryption Key."
ref: create-encryption-key
level: 4
content: |

  Use the :method:`KeyVault.createKey()` method on the ``keyVault`` 
  object to create a new data encryption key in the key vault:

  .. code-block:: javascript
      
     keyVault.createKey(
       "local",
       [ "keyAlternateName" ]
     )

  Where:

  - The first parameter *must* be ``local`` to specify the configured
    locally managed key.

  - The second parameter *may* be an array of one or more
    ``keyAltNames`` for the data encryption key. Each key alternate
    name *must* be unique. :method:`getKeyVault()` creates a unique
    index on ``keyAltNames`` to enforce uniqueness on the field if
    one does not already exist. Key alternate names facilitate data
    encryption key findability.
