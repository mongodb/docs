.. default-domain:: mongodb

Introduction
------------

|mms| is a service that creates, manages, monitors, and backs up MongoDB
deployments. You can get started with |mms| in minutes by going to
`https://mms.mongodb.com <https://mms.mongodb.com>`_ and selecting
:guilabel:`Start for Free`. |mms| Onboarding walks you through
registration and the setup of your first deployment.

During the onboarding process, |mms| provides several options for where to deploy
MongoDB and what kind of configuration to deploy. The choices you make for
your first deployment do not limit your choices for future deployments.

At any time, you can click :guilabel:`Advanced Setup` in the upper right
corner if you are already familiar with |mms| and wish to deploy an
advanced configuration, such as a replica set with an arbiter. If you
choose :guilabel:`Advanced Setup`, |mms| takes you to the
:guilabel:`Deployment` page from which you use the usual procedures to
:doc:`/tutorial/nav/management`.
