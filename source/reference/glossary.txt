   interface endpoint
      Elastic network interface with a private IP address from the IP
      address range of your |vpc| subnet on |aws|. An interface
      endpoint serves as an entry point for traffic from clients in
      your |vpc| to an |service| cluster when you create a {+aws-pl+}
      connection between an |aws| |vpc| and |service| clusters in a
      specified region.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`private-endpoint`
      
   LDAP
      Cross-platform protocol used to authenticate users and authorize
      them to access data on a cluster. You can use |service| to manage
      user authentication and authorization from all MongoDB clients
      using your own |ldap| server over |tls|. A single |ldaps|
      configuration applies to all clusters in an |service| project.
      
      .. seealso::

   link-token
      String that contains the information necessary to connect from
      |com| to |service| during a live migration from a |com| deployment
      to a cluster in |service|.

      When you are ready to live migrate data from a |com| deployment,
      you generate a link-token in |service| and then enter it in your
      |com| organization's settings. You use the same link-token to
      migrate each deployment in your |com| organization sequentially,
      one at a time. You can generate multiple link-tokens in |service|.
      Use one unique link-token for each |com| organization.


   Live Migration
      Process to seamlessly move an existing source replica set or
      sharded cluster to |service|. During the live migration process,
      |service| keeps the target cluster in sync with the remote source
      until you cut your applications over to the |service| cluster.
      |service| offers two modes of live migration:

      - Push live migration, known in the |service| user interface as
        :guilabel:`Live Migration from Ops Manager or Cloud Manager`,
        where |service| **pushes** a deployment from |com| to |service|.
      - Pull live migration, known in the |service| user interface as
        :guilabel:`General Live Migration`, where |service| **pulls**
        a deployment from a cloud or on-premise deployment to |service|.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`live-import-replica`
      
   maintenance window
      Day and time of the week when |service| should start weekly
      maintenance on your cluster. You can set your maintenance window
      in your :ref:`Project Settings <project-settings>`.
      
      .. include:: /includes/fact-urgent-maintenance.rst
      
   MongoDB Charts
      Visualization tool for your |service| data. You can launch MongoDB
      Charts from your |service| cluster and view your data with the
      Charts application to begin visualizing your data.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         `MongoDB Charts <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/charts/saas/>`__
      
   Database user
      Credentials used to authenticate a client to access a MongoDB
      database deployment. You can assign :ref:`privileges
      <atlas-user-privileges>` to a database user to determine that
      user's access level to a {+database-deployment+}. Database users
      are different from :term:`Atlas users <Atlas user>`. Database
      users have access to MongoDB deployments, not the |service|
      application.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`mongodb-users`
      
   Database user privileges
      Set of :term:`privilege actions <action>` or :term:`roles <role>`
      granted to a database user. You can assign database user
      privileges at the {+database-deployment+}, database, and
      collection level.

         :ref:`atlas-user-privileges`
      
   multi-region cluster
      |service| :term:`cluster` spanning multiple geographic regions.
      Multi-region clusters can increase availability and improve
      performance by routing application queries to the most appropriate
      geographic regions.
      
      Multi-region clusters must contain
      :term:`electable nodes <electable node>`.

      Multi-region clusters may contain
      :term:`read-only nodes <read-only node>` and
      :term:`analytics nodes <analytics node>`.
      
   network peering connection
      Process by which two Internet networks connect and exchange
      traffic. You can directly peer your |vpc| with the |service|
      |vpc| created for your MongoDB clusters. Using network peering,
      your application servers can directly connect to |service| while
      remaining isolated from public networks.

         :ref:`vpc-peering`
      
   NVMe storage
      *Available for M40+ clusters hosted on AWS*
      
      For applications hosted on |aws| which require low-latency and
      high-throughput IO, you can use the NVMe :term:`cluster class`.
      The NVMe cluster class leverages a unique data protocol to
      greatly improve data access speeds.
      
      NVMe clusters use a :manual:`hidden secondary node
      </core/replica-set-hidden-member/>` consisting of a provisioned
      volume with high throughput and |iops| to facilitate backup.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`create-cluster-storage`
      
   organization
      Logical grouping of |service| :term:`projects <project>`. You can
      leverage an organization to manage billing, users, and security
      settings for the projects it contains.
      
      .. include:: /includes/list-organization-hierarchy.rst
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`organizations`
      
   organization ID
      Unique 24-digit hexadecimal string used to identify your
      |service| :term:`organization`.
      The :doc:`Get All Organizations </reference/api/organization-get-all>`
      endpoint returns the ID of all organizations that the
      authenticated user executing the |api| call can access.

   Performance Advisor
      |service| tool that monitors slow queries executed on your
      cluster and suggests indexes to improve query performance. Each
      index that the Performance Advisor suggests include an
      :term:`Impact` score indicating the potential performance
      improvement that index would bring.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`performance-advisor`

   primary
      In a :term:`replica set`, the primary is the member that receives
      all write operations. In
      :ref:`multi-region clusters <create-cluster-multi-region>`,
      |service| prioritizes nodes in the :term:`Highest Priority region` 
      for primary eligibility during elections.

   project
      Logical grouping of :term:`{+database-deployments+}
      <deployment>`. You can have multiple {+database-deployments+}
      within a single project and multiple projects within a single
      :term:`organization`.
      
      .. note::
      
         Project is synonymous with :term:`group`.

   project ID
      Unique 24-digit hexadecimal string used to identify your
      |service| :term:`project`. The
      :doc:`Get All Projects </reference/api/project-get-all>` |api|
      endpoint returns the ID of all projects that the authenticated
      user executing the API call can access.
      
      .. note::
      
         Project ID is synonymous with group ID.
      
   Query Profiler
      |service| tool that diagnoses and monitors performance
      issues in your cluster. The Query Profiler can expose long-running
      queries and their performance statistics. You can filter the data
      returned by the Query Profiler to hone in on specific namespaces
      and operation types.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`query-profiler`
      
   read-only node
      Replica set in a dedicated geographic region that supplements your
      :term:`electable node` regions. You can use read-only nodes to
      localize data where it is most frequently read to improve
      performance.
      
   Real-Time Performance Panel
      |service| monitoring service that displays current network
      traffic, database operations on your clusters, and hardware
      statistics about your host machines. Use the |rtpp| to visually
      evaluate query execution times, monitor network activity, and
      discover potential replication lag on secondary members of
      replica sets.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`real-time-metrics-status-tab`
      
   replica set
      Group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set. Replica
      sets provide redundancy, high availability, and are the basis for
      all production deployments.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :manual:`Replication </replication>`
      
   rolling restart
      Process that restarts all nodes in the cluster in sequence. To
      maintain cluster availability, |service| restarts one node at a
      time starting with a :term:`secondary <secondary>` node.
      |service| always maintains a primary node until the rolling
      restart completes.

   sharded cluster
      Set of nodes comprising a :term:`sharded <sharding>` MongoDB
      deployment. A sharded cluster consists of config servers, shards,
      and one or more |mongos| routing processes.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :manual:`Sharded Cluster Components </core/sharded-cluster-components/>`
