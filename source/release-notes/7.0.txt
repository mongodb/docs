This page describes changes and new features introduced in MongoDB 7.0.

MongoDB 7.0 is a |lts| Release, which means that it is supported for
both MongoDB Atlas and on-premises deployments. MongoDB 7.0 includes
changes introduced in MongoDB Rapid Releases 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3. To see
changes introduced in these rapid releases, see
:ref:`7.0-rapid-release-changes`. 

To learn more about the differences between |lts| and Rapid releases,

</atlas-search/atlas-search-overview/#fts-indexes>` with ``mongosh``
methods and database commands. {+fts+} index commands are only available
for deployments hosted on :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>`, and require an
Atlas cluster tier of at least M10.

To manage {+fts+} indexes, use the following commands:

.. |fts-index| replace:: {+fts+} index

time between {+auto-merge-action+} rounds, in seconds. 
``autoMergerIntervalSecs`` can only be set on config servers of sharded
clusters.

{+auto-merge-upper+} is enabled, specifies the minimum amount time 
between merges initiated by the {+auto-merge-upper+} on the same 
collection, in milliseconds. ``autoMergerThrottlingMS`` can only be set
on config servers of sharded clusters.

balancerMigrationsThrottlingMs Parameter
````````````````````````````````````````

MongoDB 7.0 adds the :parameter:`balancerMigrationsThrottlingMs`
parameter which allows you to throttle the balancing rate.

enableDetailedConnectionHealthMetricLogLines Parameter
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````

MongoDB 7.0 adds the :parameter:`enableDetailedConnectionHealthMetricLogLines`
parameter which lets you specify whether or not a set of :ref:`log messages 
<log-messages-ref>` related to cluster connection health metrics appears in the 
log.

``oidcIdentityProviders`` Parameter
```````````````````````````````````

MongoDB 7.0  adds the :parameter:`oidcIdentityProviders` parameter which allows 
you to specify identity provider (IDP) configurations when using

Security
--------

{+qe+} General Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 7.0, :ref:`Queryable Encryption with equality
queries <qe-manual-feature-qe>` is generally available (GA). 
Improvements in the GA make it incompatible with the
{+qe-preview+}, which should not be used now that the feature is GA. 
For details, see :ref:`7.0-compatibility`.

KMIP 1.0 and 1.1 Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 7.0 (and 6.0.6) adds the :setting:`useLegacyProtocol
<security.kmip.useLegacyProtocol>` setting. This setting allows MongoDB
servers to connect to KMIP servers that use KMIP protocol version 1.0 or
1.1.

OpenSSL and FIPS Support
````````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/ssl-and-fips-support.rst

For details, see :ref:`transport-encryption`.

OpenID Connect
``````````````
Starting in 7.0, MongoDB Enterprise provides support for 
:ref:`OpenID Connect <authentication-oidc>` authentication. OpenID Connect is an 
authentication layer built on top of OAuth2. You can use OpenID Connect to 
configure single sign-on between your MongoDB database and a third-party identity 
provider.

Aggregation
-----------

New operators:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name

       This operator can be used as an accumulator and as an aggregation
       expression.

   * - :group:`$percentile`
     - .. include:: /includes/aggregation/fact-return-percentile.rst

       This operator can be used as an accumulator and as an aggregation
       expression.

Month Name Specifier for $dateToString 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 7.0 adds the following format specifiers to use with the 
:expression:`$dateToString` operator: 

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 60 20

   * - Specifiers
     - Description
     - Possible Values

   * - ``%b``
     - Abbreviated month name (3 letters)
     - ``jan``-``dec``

   * - ``%B``
     - Full month name
     - ``january``-``december``

.. _7.0-time-series:

Time Series
-----------

MongoDB 7.0 removes most of the time series limitations from these
operations that are based on the :dbcommand:`delete` command:

.. include:: /includes/time-series/fact-delete-operations-list.rst

.. _7.0-sharding:

Sharding
--------

Sharding Metadata Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 7.0, the :dbcommand:`checkMetadataConsistency` command
is available to check sharding metadata at the cluster, database, and 
collection levels for inconsistencies.  These inconsistencies can originate
in cases such as:

- Upgrades in cases where the cluster encountered a bug while running previous
  releases of MongoDB
  
- Manual interventions that corrupt the cluster catalog

The following helper methods are now available through :program:`mongosh`:

* :method:`db.checkMetadataConsistency`
* :method:`db.collection.checkMetadataConsistency`
* :method:`sh.checkMetadataConsistency`

For more information on the inconsistencies the command checks for, see
:ref:`inconsistency-types`.

mergeAllChunksOnShard Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 7.0, the :dbcommand:`mergeAllChunksOnShard` command
finds and merges all :ref:`mergeable chunks <mergeability>` that a shard 
owns for a given collection.

The {+auto-merge-upper+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 7.0, :ref:`the {+auto-merge-upper+} 
<automerger-concept>` can automatically merge chunks that meet the 
:ref:`mergeability requirements <mergeability-concept>`. The 
{+auto-merge-upper+} is enabled by default. 

Starting in MongoDB 7.0, you can use the following methods to control
the {+auto-merge-upper+} behavior:

- :method:`sh.startAutoMerger()`
- :method:`sh.stopAutoMerger()`
- :method:`sh.enableAutoMerger()`
- :method:`sh.disableAutoMerger()`

enableAutoMerger Parameter for configureCollectionBalancing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 7.0, the :dbcommand:`configureCollectionBalancing`
command accepts the ``enableAutoMerger`` parameter. Use 
``enableAutoMerger`` to set whether or not the 
:ref:`{+auto-merge-upper+} <automerger-concept>` takes this collection 
into account.

rangeDeleterHighPriority Parameter for Deprioritizing Range deletions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 7.0, you can prioritize or deprioritize cleanup of
:term:`orphaned documents <orphaned document>` over user operations
using the :parameter:`rangeDeleterHighPriority` parameter. 

operationsBlockedByRefresh Metrics Removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 7.0 removes the ``operationsBlockedByRefresh`` document that
contains statistics about operations blocked by catalog cache refresh
activity because the ``operationsBlockedByRefresh`` counters increased
on ``mongos`` for every operation that used collection routing
information even if the operation wasn't blocked by a catalog refresh
activity. 

analyzeShardKey Command and db.collection.analyzeShardKey() Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 7.0 adds the :dbcommand:`analyzeShardKey` command and the 
:method:`db.collection.analyzeShardKey()` method, which let you
calculate metrics for evaluating a shard key.

configureQueryAnalyzer Command and db.collection.configureQueryAnalyzer() Method 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 7.0 adds the :dbcommand:`configureQueryAnalyzer` command, which
allows you to configure query sampling for a collection. MongoDB 7.0
also adds the :method:`db.collection.configureQueryAnalyzer()`, which
wraps the ``configureQueryAnalyzer`` command. Sampled queries provide 
information to ``analyzeShardKey`` to calculate metrics about read and 
write distribution of a shard key.

Downgrade Policy Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 7.0: 

- Binary downgrades are no longer supported for MongoDB Community Edition. 

- You cannot downgrade your deployment's {+fcv+} to or from a
  :ref:`rapid release <rapid-releases>` version of MongoDB.

- The :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command requires an
  additional parameter, ``confirm``, which must be set to ``true`` to
  upgrade or downgrade {+fcv+}.

- If you upgrade or downgrade your deployment's {+fcv+}, you cannot
  downgrade your Enterprise deployment's binary version without assistance from
  support.

.. |version| replace:: 7.0

Backward-Incompatible Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 7.0 includes features that are not compatible with earlier releases.
Downgrading from 7.0 to an earlier release requires that you remove data 
that uses these features.

For more information, see :ref:`7.0-downgrade-incompatible`.
