The :guilabel:`Authentication` tab allows you to connect to deployments that 
require authentication. To learn about authentication mechanisms within MongoDB,
see :manual:`Authentication Mechanisms </core/authentication/#authentication-mechanisms>`.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Open the :guilabel:`New Connection` modal.

      .. include:: /includes/open-new-connection.rst

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Advanced Connection Options`.

      .. figure:: /images/compass/advanced-connection-options.png
         :figwidth: 690px
         :alt: New Advanced Connection Options

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Authentication` tab.

      Select your authentication method from the following options: 
      
      - :ref:`Username / Password <username-password>`

      - :ref:`OIDC <oidc>`
      
      - :ref:`X.509 <x509>`
      
      - :ref:`Kerberos <kerberos-authentication>`
      
      - :ref:`LDAP <ldap-authentication>`
      
      - :ref:`AWS IAM <aws-iam-authentication>`

      .. _username-password:

      Username / Password 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Provide the following information:

      - Username

      - Password

      - (Optional) :manual:`Authentication Database </core/security-users/#authentication-database>`

      - Authentication Mechancism:
         
        - Default

          |

          The ``Default`` setting selects the first authentication mechanism 
          supported by the server according to an order of preference. 
          
          |

          With the ``Default`` setting, MongoDB tries to authenticate using
          the following mechanisms in the order they are listed:

          1. ``SCRAM-SHA-256``
          
          #. ``SCRAM-SHA-1``

          #. ``MONGODB-CR``
          
          |

        - :manual:`SCRAM-SHA-1 </core/security-scram/>`

        - :manual:`SCRAM-SHA-256 </core/security-scram/>`

      .. _oidc:

      OIDC
      ~~~~

      Select :guilabel:`OIDC` if the deployment uses :manual:`OpenID Connect </core/security-oidc/>` 
      as its authentication mechanism.
      
      Provide the following information:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 50 50

         * - Field
           - Description

         * - Username
           - Optional. OpenID Connect username.

         * - Auth Code Flow Redirect URI
           - Optional. Specify a URI where the identity provider redirects you after authentication.
             The URI must match the configuration of the Identity Provider.
             The default is ``http://localhost:27097/redirect``.

         * - Consider Target Endpoint Trusted
           - Optional. Allows connecting to a target endpoint that is not in the 
             list of endpoints that are considered trusted by default. Only use 
             this option when connecting to servers that you trust.

         * - Enable Device Authentication Flow
           - Optional. When the :ref:`Show Device Auth Flow Checkbox <compass-settings-reference>` 
             setting is enabled, |compass-short| can provide you with a URL and code 
             to finish authentication. 
             
             This is a less secure authentication flow that can be used as a 
             fallback when browser-based authentication is unavailable.

         * - Use Application-Level Proxy Settings 
           - Optional. Use the application-level proxy settings specified in the 
             :ref:`Compass Settings panel <compass-interface-settings>`. 
             Enabled by default. If you don't enable application-level proxy 
             settings, |compass-short| uses the same proxy to connect to both 
             the cluster and identity provider.

         * - Send a nonce in the Auth Code Request
           - Optional. Includes a random nonce as a part of the auth code 
             request to prevent replay attacks. Enabled by default.

             The nonce is an important security component. Only disable this
             setting if it is not supported by your OIDC provider.

      .. _x509:

      X.509
      ~~~~~

      Select :guilabel:`X.509` if the deployment uses :manual:`X.509 
      </core/security-x.509/>` as its authentication mechanism.

      .. note:: 

         X.509 Authentication requires a client certificate. To enable 
         TLS and add a client certificate, see the :ref:`TLS / SSL tab <tls-ssl-tab>`
         in |compass-short|.

      .. _kerberos-authentication:

      Kerberos
      ~~~~~~~~

      Select :guilabel:`Kerberos` if the deployment uses :manual:`Kerberos 
      </core/kerberos/>` as its authentication mechanism. 

      Provide the following information:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 50, 50

         * - Field
           - Description

         * - Principal
           - Every participant in the authenticated communication is known as a 
             "principal", and every principal must have a unique name. 

         * - (Optional) Service Name
           - Every MongoDB :binary:`mongod` and :binary:`mongos` instance 
             (or ``mongod.exe`` and ``mongos.exe`` on Windows) must have an associated service name. The 
             default is ``mongodb``. 

         * - (Optional) Canonicalize Host Name
           - Kerberos uses the canonicalized form of the host name ``(cname)`` 
             when constructing the principal for |compass|. 

         * - (Optional) Service Realm 
           - The service realm is the domain over which a Kerberos authentication 
             server has the authority to authenticate a user.

             If you choose to :guilabel:`Canonicalize Host Name`, you can specify 
             one of the following options:

             .. list-table::
                :header-rows: 1
                :widths: 50 50

                * - Option
                  - Description 

                * - Forward
                  - The driver does a ``cname`` lookup on the kerberos hostname.

                * - Forward and Reverse
                  - Performs a forward DNS lookup and then a reverse lookup on that 
                    value to canonicalize the hostname.
                    
             For more information on principal name canonicalization in Kerberos, see 
             this `RFC document <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6806.html>`__.
      
         * - (Optional) Provide password directly
           - Used to verify your identity. To show the Kerberos password field, 
             you must enable the :ref:`showKerberosPasswordField 
             <compass-kerberos-password>` option.

      Authenticate as a Different Kerberos User on Windows
      ````````````````````````````````````````````````````

      When you authenticate with Kerberos on Windows, the
      :guilabel:`Principal` you specify must match the principal of the
      security context that |compass-short| is running. Normally, this
      is the logged-in user who is running |compass-short|.

      To authenticate as a different Kerberos user, run |compass| as the
      chosen user and specify the :guilabel:`Principal` for that user.
      To run |compass| as a different user, either:
      
      - Hold :guilabel:`Shift` and right-click the |compass| program
        icon to select :guilabel:`Run as a different user`.
      
      - Use the ``runas`` command-line tool. For example, the following
        command runs |compass| as a user named ``admin``:

        .. code-block:: sh
              
           runas /profile /user:mymachine\admin <path to MongoDB Compass>

      After you start |compass| as the chosen user, to authenticate
      against your Kerberos-enabled MongoDB deployment, specify the
      :guilabel:`Principal` for the corresponding user.

      .. _ldap-authentication:

      LDAP
      ~~~~

      Select :guilabel:`LDAP` if the deployment uses :manual:`LDAP 
      </core/security-ldap-external/>` as its authentication mechanism. 

      Provide the following information:

      - Username

      - Password

      .. _aws-iam-authentication:

      AWS IAM  
      ~~~~~~~

      Select :guilabel:`AWS IAM` if the deployment uses `AWS IAM 
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html>`__ as 
      its authentication mechanism. 
      
      The following fields are optional as they can be defined on your platform 
      using their respective AWS IAM environment variables. |compass| will 
      use these environment variable values to authenticate; you do not 
      need to specify them in the connection string.

      - (Optional) AWS Access Key Id
      
      - (Optional) AWS Secret Access Key 

      - (Optional) AWS Session Token

   .. step:: (Optional) For advanced connection configuration options, click the :ref:`Advanced <advanced-connection-tab>` tab.

   .. step:: Click Connect.

   To disconnect from your deployment, see :ref:`<disconnect-tab>`.
