Roles grant users access to MongoDB resources. By default, MongoDB
provides some :manual:`built-in roles </reference/built-in-roles>`,
but if these roles cannot describe a desired privilege set, you can
create custom roles.

When you create a role, you specify the database to which it applies.
|mms| stores your custom roles on all MongoDB instances in your |mms|
project but uniquely identifies a role by the combination of the
database name and role name. If a database with that name exists on
multiple deployments within your |mms| project, the role applies to
each of those databases. If you create a role on the ``admin``
database, the role applies to all ``admin`` databases in the
deployment.

Roles consist of privileges that grant access to specific actions on
specific resources. On most databases, a resource is the database or a
collection, but on the ``admin`` database a resource can be all
databases, all collections with a given name across databases, or all
deployments.

A role can inherit privileges from other roles in its database. A role
on the ``admin`` database can inherit privileges from roles in other
databases.

MongoDB roles are separate from |mms| :doc:`roles </reference/user-roles>`.

Prerequisite
------------

MongoDB access control
:doc:`must be enabled </tutorial/nav/security-enable-authentication>`
to apply roles. You can create roles before enabling accessing control
or after, but they don't go into effect until you enable access
control.

Create a Custom MongoDB Role
----------------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/add-mongodb-role.rst

Edit a Custom Role
------------------

You can change a custom role's privileges. You cannot change its name
or database.

.. include:: /includes/steps/edit-mongodb-role.rst

View Privileges for a Role
--------------------------

To view a role's privileges, click :guilabel:`Deployment`, then
the :guilabel:`Security` tab, then :guilabel:`Roles`,
then :guilabel:`view privileges` next to the role.

Each privilege pairs a resource with a set of
:manual:`Privilege Actions </reference/privilege-actions>`. All roles
are assigned a database. Each
:manual:`built-in role </reference/built-in-roles>` is assigned to
either ``admin`` database or every database.

Remove a Custom Role
