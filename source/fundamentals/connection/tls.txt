You can connect to MongoDB instances with the
`TLS/SSL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security>`__
security protocol using the underlying TLS/SSL support in the JDK. To
configure your connection to use TLS/SSL, enable the TLS/SSL settings in
either the :java-docs:`ConnectionString <apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/ConnectionString.html>
or :java-docs:`MongoClientSettings <apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.html>.

.. note:: Debugging TLS/SSL

   If you experience trouble setting up your TLS/SSL connection, you can
   use the ``-Djavax.net.debug=all`` system property to view additional
   log statements. See `the Oracle guide to debugging TLS/SSL connections
   <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/ReadDebug.html>`__
   for more information.

.. _tls-enable:

Enable TLS/SSL
--------------

You can enable TLS/SSL for the connection to your MongoDB instance
in two different ways: through a parameter in your connection string, or
using a method in the ``MongoClientSettings.Builder`` class.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: ConnectionString
      :tabid: connectionstring

      To enable TLS/SSL on a connection with a :java-sync-api:`ConnectionString
      <com/mongodb/ConnectionString.html>`, assign the connection string
      parameter ``tls`` a value of ``true`` in the connection string passed to
      ``MongoClients.create()``:

      .. code-block:: java

         MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create("mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>?tls=true");

   .. tab:: MongoClientSettings
      :tabid: mongoclientsettings

      To configure your ``MongoClient``'s TLS/SSL connection options using the
      ``MongoClientSettings.Builder`` class, call the :java-sync-api:`applyToSslSettings()
      <com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToSslSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`
      method. Set the ``enabled`` property to ``true`` in the ``SslSettings.Builder``
      block to enable TLS/SSL:

      .. code-block:: java

         MongoClientSettings settings = MongoClientSettings.builder()
                .applyToSslSettings(builder ->
                    builder.enabled(true))
                .build();
         MongoClient client = MongoClients.create(settings);

.. _tls_configure-certificates:

Configure Certificates
----------------------

Java applications that initiate TLS/SSL requests require access to
cryptographic certificates that prove identity for the application
itself as well as other applications with which the application
interacts. To configure access to these certificates in your application,
you should use the JVM Trust Store and the JVM Key Store.

.. _tls-configure-jvm-truststore:

Configure the JVM Trust Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   By default, the JRE includes many commonly used public certificates
   from signing authorities like `Let's Encrypt
   <https://letsencrypt.org/>`__. As a result, you can connect to
   instances of :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas <>` (or any other server whose
   certificate is signed by an authority in the JRE's default
   certificate store) with TLS/SSL without configuring the trust store.

The JVM trust store saves certificates that securely identify other
applications with which your Java application interacts. Using these
certificates, your application can prove that the connection to another
application is genuine and secure from tampering by third parties.

If your MongoDB instance uses a certificate that is signed by an
authority that is not present in the JRE's default certificate store,
your application must configure two system properties to initiate
SSL/TLS requests. These properties ensure that your application is able to
validate the TLS/SSL certificate presented by a connected MongoDB instance.

- ``javax.net.ssl.trustStore``: the path to a trust store containing the
  certificate of the signing authority

- ``javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword``: the password to access the trust
  store defined in ``javax.net.ssl.trustStore``

You can create a trust store with the `keytool
<http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html>`__
command line tool provided as part of the JDK:

.. code-block:: console

   keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -file <path to certificate authority file>
            -keystore <path to trust store> -storepass <password>

Configure the JVM Key Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   By default, MongoDB instances do not perform client certificate
   validation. You only need to configure the key store if you explicitly
   configured your MongoDB instance to validate client certificates.

The JVM key store saves certificates that securely identify your Java
application to other applications. Using these certificates, other
applications can prove that the connection to your application is
genuine and secure from tampering by third parties.

An application that intiates TLS/SSL requests needs to set two JVM system
properties to ensure that the client presents a TLS/SSL certificate to
the MongoDB server:

- ``javax.net.ssl.keyStore``: the path to a key store containing the client's
  TLS/SSL certificates

- ``javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword``: the password to access the key store
  defined in ``javax.net.ssl.keyStore``

You can create a key store with the `keytool
<http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html>`__
or `openssl <https://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/openssl.html>`__ command
line tools.

For more information on configuring a Java application to use TLS/SSL,
please refer to the `JSSE Reference Guide
<http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html>`__.

.. _tls-disable-hostname-verification:

Disable Hostname Verification
-----------------------------

By default, the driver ensures that the hostname included in the server's
TLS/SSL certificate(s) matches the hostname(s) provided when constructing
a ``MongoClient``. If you need to disable hostname verification for your
application, you can explicitly disable this by setting the
``invalidHostNameAllowed`` property of the builder to ``true`` in the
``applytoSslSettings()`` builder lambda:

.. code-block:: java

   MongoClientSettings settings = MongoClientSettings.builder()
        .applyToSslSettings(builder -> {
                    builder.enabled(true);
                    builder.invalidHostNameAllowed(true);
                })
        .build();

.. warning::

   Disabling hostname verification can make your configuration
   `insecure <https://tlseminar.github.io/docs/mostdangerous.pdf>`__.
   You should only disable hostname verification for testing purposes or
   when there is no other alternative.

.. _tls-restrict-tls-1.2:

Restrict Connections to TLS 1.2 Only
------------------------------------

To restrict your application to use only the TLS 1.2 protocol, set the
``jdk.tls.client.protocols`` system property to "TLSv1.2".

.. note::

   Java Runtime Environments (JREs) prior to Java 8 only enabled
   the TLS 1.2 protocol in update releases. If your JRE has not enabled
   the TLS 1.2 protocol, you may need to upgrade to a later release to
   connect using TLS 1.2.

.. _tls-custom-sslContext:

Customize TLS/SSL Configuration with an SSLContext
--------------------------------------------------

If your TLS/SSL configuration requires additional customization, you can
set the ``sslContext`` property of your ``MongoClient`` by
passing an `SSLContext
<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/class-use/SSLContext.html>`__
object to the builder in the ``applyToSslSettings()`` lambda:

.. code-block:: java

   SSLContext sslContext = ...
   MongoClientSettings settings = MongoClientSettings.builder()
        .applyToSslSettings(builder -> {
                    builder.enabled(true);
                    builder.context(sslContext);
                })
        .build();
   MongoClient client = MongoClients.create(settings);
