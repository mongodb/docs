Disable Natural Language Charts
-------------------------------

- |charts-short| enables Natural Language Charts once you click the 
  :guilabel:`Use Natural Language Mode` button. For details on enabling

- If you no longer want to use Natural Language Charts, you can ignore this button and 
  |charts-short| will not send data to the Generative AI models. If you are a

  by navigating to the :guilabel:`AI features` page in the 
  left navigation menu and setting the toggle to off.
