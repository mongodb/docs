Android Studio Debugging
------------------------

.. important::

   The Android Studio debugger can provide misleading values for
   Realm object fields. For correct values, you can watch
   accessor values instead, or use the Realm object
   ``toString()`` method to see the latest field values.

This section details information you should keep in mind when debugging
Realm applications with Android Studio to avoid incorrect
value reporting. When you watch a Realm object,
you'll see values displayed in the object's fields. These values 
are incorrect because the field values themselves are not used. This is
because Realm creates a :ref:`proxy object
<java-realm-proxy>` behind the scenes, overriding
the getters and setters to access the persisted data in the
realm. To see the correct values, add a watch on the accessors.
See the image below:

.. figure:: /images/android-studio-debugging.png
   :alt: When using the Android Studio debugger, accessors display the correct field value, while fields show outdated information.

In the image above, the debugger has stopped on line ``113``. There are
three watch values:

- The ``person`` variable
- The ``person.getName()`` accessor
- The ``person.getAge()`` accessor

The code from lines ``107`` to ``111`` alters the ``person`` instance by
changing the name and age in a write transaction. On line ``113``, the ``person`` watch instance reports
incorrect values for the *field* watch values. The watch values that use
the *accessors* report values that are correct.

NDK Debugging
-------------

The Realm Java SDK library contains native code. 
Debugging NDK crashes can be cumbersome, as the default stack trace
provides minimal information. 

We recommend you use a crash reporting tool such as
`Crashlytics <http://www.crashlytics.com/>`__. This gives you the
ability to track native errors and gather other valuable information. We
can help with your issues faster if you have this information.

To enable NDK crash reporting in Crashlytics for
your project, add the following to the root of your application
``build.gradle`` file:

.. code-block:: groovy
   :copyable: false

   crashlytics {
      enableNdk true
   }

.. note::

   The values ``androidNdkOut`` and ``androidNdkLibsOut`` are not needed.
