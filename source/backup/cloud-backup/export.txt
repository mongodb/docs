|service| lets you export your {+Cloud-Backup+} snapshots to an object
storage service.

To learn how to manage automated backup policies and schedules, see
:ref:`configure-backup-policy`.

.. _snapshot-export-supported-storage:

Supported Storage Services
--------------------------

|service| currently supports the following object
storage services:

- |aws| |s3| buckets
- {+az-bs+}

How |service| Exports Snapshots 
-------------------------------

You can manually export individual snapshots or set up an export 
policy for automatic export of your snapshots. For automatic exports, 
you must specify a frequency in your export policy: 

- Daily
- Weekly
- Monthly
- Yearly

|service| automatically exports any backup snapshot with the
frequency type that matches the export frequency. The exported result 
is a full backup of that snapshot.

.. example::

   Consider the following: 

   - A backup policy that sets a weekly and monthly snapshot schedule 
   - An export policy that sets a monthly export frequency

   Suppose, at the end of the month, the weekly and monthly snapshots 
   happen on the same day. There would be ``4`` snapshots of which 
   ``3`` would be weekly snapshots and the fourth snapshot, although 
   treated as a weekly snapshot by |service|, would also be the monthly 
   snapshot because it happened on the same day. |service| will export 
   the monthly snapshot only because the export frequency matches the 
   snapshot frequency for that snapshot. To export the weekly snapshots 
   as well, update the export policy to export weekly snapshots also. 
   If the export frequency is set to weekly, |service| would export all 
   ``4`` snapshots.

As the export progresses, you may see partial results in your object
storage service.

|service| persists documents in snapshots irrespective of
:manual:`Time to Live <expire-data>` settings. You can access these
documents from your snapshot past their Time to Live deadline.

.. include:: /includes/fact-snapshot-export-cost.rst

Files |service| Uploads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| uploads an empty file to ``/exported_snapshots/.permissioncheck`` 
when you:

- Add a new :ref:`object store <snapshot-export-supported-storage>` for export
- Start an export

After |service| finishes exporting, |service| uploads a metadata file 
named ``.complete`` and a metadata file named ``metadata.json`` for 
each collection. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: .complete File 
      :tabid: complete

      |service| uploads the metadata file named ``.complete`` in the 
      following path on your object store: 

      .. code-block:: shell
         :copyable: false

         /exported_snapshots/<orgUUID>/<projectUUID>/<clusterName>/<initiationDateOfSnapshot>/<timestamp>/

      .. note:: 

         By default, |service| uses organization and project UUIDs in 
         the path for the metadata files. To use organization and 
         project names instead of UUIDs, set the 
         ``useOrgAndGroupNamesInExportPrefix`` flag to ``true`` via the 
         :oas-atlas-op:`API 
         </updateCloudBackupBackupPolicyForOneCluster>`. |service| 
         replaces any spaces with underscores (``_``) and removes any 
         :aws:`characters that might require special handling 
         </AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html>` and 
         :aws:`characters to avoid 
         </AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html>` from the 
         organization and project names in the path.

      The ``.complete`` metadata file is in |json| format and contains 
      the following fields: 

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 35 65 

         * - Field
           - Description 

         * - ``orgId``
           - Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies the 
             |service| organization.

         * - ``orgName``
           - Name of the |service| organization. 

         * - ``groupId``
           - Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies the 
             project in the |service| organization.

         * - ``groupName``
           - Name of the |service| project. 

         * - ``clusterUniqueId``
           - Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies the 
             |service| cluster.

         * - ``clusterName``
           - Name of the |service| project.

         * - ``snapshotInitiationDate``
           - Date when snapshot was taken.

         * - ``totalFiles``
           - Total number of files uploaded to the object store.

         * - ``labels``
           - Labels of the {+cluster+} whose snapshot was exported.

         * - ``customData``
           - Custom data, if any, that you specified when creating the 
             export job.

            }

   .. tab:: metadata.json File 
      :tabid: metadata

      |service| uploads the ``metadata.json`` file for each collection 
      in the following path on your object store: 

      .. code-block:: shell
         :copyable: false

         /exported_snapshots/<orgUUID>/<projectUUID>/<clusterName>/<initiationDateOfSnapshot>/<timestamp>/<dbName>/<collectionName>/metadata.json

      .. note:: 

         By default, |service| uses organization and project UUIDs in 
         the path for the metadata files. To use organization and 
         project names instead of UUIDs, set the 
         ``useOrgAndGroupNamesInExportPrefix`` flag via the 
         :oas-atlas-op:`API 
         </updateCloudBackupBackupPolicyForOneCluster>` to true. 
         |service| replaces any spaces with underscores (``_``) and 
         removes any :aws:`characters that might require special 
         handling </AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html>` and 
         :aws:`characters to avoid 
         </AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html>` from the 
         organization and project names in the path.

      The metadata file is in |json| format and contains the following 
      fields: 

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 35 65 

         * - Field
           - Description 

         * - ``collectionName``
           - Human-readable label that identifies the collection.

         * - ``indexes``
           - List of all the indexes on the collection in the format 
             returned by :manual:`db.collection.getIndexes 
             </reference/method/db.collection.getIndexes/#output>` 
             command. 

         * - ``options``
           - Configuration options defined on the collection. To learn 
             more about the options, see :manual:`db.createCollection() 
             </reference/method/db.createCollection/>` command.

         * - ``type``
           - (Optional) Type of collection. This field is only supported
	     for time series collections, with a value of ``timeseries``.
	     Leave this field unset for standard collections.

             |service| doesn't support export of ``view`` type
	     collections.

         * - ``uuid``
           - Collection's UUID. To learn more about UUID, see 
             :manual:`UUID </reference/method/UUID/>`.

      .. example:: 

         .. code-block:: json

              "collectionName":"somecol"
            }

If an export job fails: 

- |service| doesn't automatically try to export again.
- |service| doesn't remove any partial data in your object store.

Exported Data Format
--------------------

|service| uploads ``gzip``-compressed :manual:`Extended JSON (v2)
</reference/mongodb-extended-json>` documents. |service| doesn't upload
these documents in order. The following is the path to the files on
your :ref:`object store <snapshot-export-supported-storage>`:

.. code-block:: sh 
   :copyable: false 

   /exported_snapshots/<orgName>/<projectName>/<clusterName>/<initiationDateOfSnapshot>/<timestamp>/<dbName>/<collectionName>/<shardName>.<increment>.json.gz

Where: 

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 35 65

   * - ``<orgName>``
     - Name of your |service| organization.

   * - ``<projectName>``
     - Name of your |service| project.

   * - ``<clusterName>``
     - Name of your |service| cluster.

   * - ``<initiationDateOfSnapshot>``
     - Date when snapshot was taken.

   * - ``<timestamp>``
     - Timestamp when the export job was created.

   * - ``<dbName>``
     - Name of the database in the |service| cluster.

   * - ``<collectionName>``
     - Name of the |service| collection.

   * - ``<shardName>``
     - Name of the replica set. For sharded collections, this is the
       name of the :manual:`primary shard <primary-shard>`.

   * - ``<increment>``
     - Count that is incremented as chunks are uploaded. Starts at 
       ``0``.

Limitations 
-----------

You can't perform the following actions:

- Export :ref:`fallback snapshots <cps-fallback-snapshots>`.
- Have more than one active export per snapshot.
- Export :manual:`view collections <views>`, or
  :manual:`system collections <system-collections>`,
  with the exception of ``<database>.system.js`` collections.
- Export snapshots from {+clusters+} in |a-service| project
  with IP-restricted :ref:`Encryption at Rest
  <security-kms-encryption>` enabled.
- Export snapshots from projects configured for
  :ref:`Private Endpoints <atlas-configure-private-endpoint>`.

Required Access
---------------

To manage your {+Cloud-Backup+} snapshots, you must have
:authrole:`Project Backup Manager` or :authrole:`Project Owner` access 
to the project.

Users with :authrole:`Organization Owner` access must add themselves as 
a ``Project Backup Manager`` or ``Project Owner`` to the project before 
they can manage {+Cloud-Backup+} snapshots. 

Prerequisites
-------------

To export your {+Cloud-Backup+} snapshots, you need an ``M10`` or
higher |service| {+cluster+} with {+Cloud-Backup+} :ref:`enabled
<backup-cloud-provider>`. In addition, to export to an object store,
you must do the following:

Export Management 
-----------------

You can create and manage snapshot exports to |aws| |s3| Buckets from
the {+atlas-cli+} and {+atlas-admin-api+} or to {+az-bs+} Containers
from the {+atlas-admin-api+}.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      .. note:: 

         You can't export snapshots to {+az-bs+} Containers using the
         {+atlas-cli+}. 

      Manage Export Jobs
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      You can manage export jobs using the {+atlas-cli+} by creating or viewing export jobs.

      Create an Export Job
      `````````````````````

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-backups-exports-jobs-create-and-watch.rst

      View Export Jobs
      `````````````````

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-backups-exports-jobs-describe-and-list.rst

      Manage Export Buckets
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      You can manage export buckets using the {+atlas-cli+} by creating, viewing, or deleting export buckets.

      Create One Export Bucket
      ````````````````````````

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-backups-exports-buckets-create.rst

      View Export Buckets
      ```````````````````

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-backups-exports-buckets-describe-and-list.rst

      Delete an Export Bucket

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-backups-exports-buckets-delete.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: api

      To grant and manage cloud provider access and to create and manage
      snapshot export jobs, the |api| that you use must have the
      :authrole:`Project Owner` role.

      Manage Export Buckets 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Use the following to :oas-atlas-tag:`manage </Cloud-Backups>`
      export Buckets or Containers.
      
      Create One Export Bucket 
      ````````````````````````
      
      To grant access to |aws| |s3| Bucket or {+az-bs+} Container for
      exporting snapshots, send a ``POST`` request to the
      :oas-atlas-tag:`Cloud Backups </Cloud-Backups>` resource
      :oas-atlas-op:`endpoint </createExportBucket>`. This enables the
      |aws| |s3| Bucket or {+az-bs+} Container to receive |service|
      Cloud Backup snapshots. When sending the request to grant access,
      you must provide the following information: 

      .. tabs:: 

         .. tab:: AWS 
            :tabid: aws 

            - Unique 24-hexadecimal character string that identifies the
              unified AWS access role ID that |service| must use to 
              access the |aws| |s3| Bucket. To learn more, see
              :ref:`set-up-unified-aws-access`. 

         .. tab:: Azure 
            :tabid: azure 

            - Unique 24-hexadecimal character string that identifies the
              |azure| Service Principal that |service| must use to
              access the {+az-bs+}. To learn more, see
              :ref:`manage-azure-access`. 
            - Service endpoint of your {+az-bs+} account. To learn more,
              see :azure:`Azure Documentation </storage/common/storage-account-get-info?tabs=azure-cli#get-service-endpoints-for-the-storage-account>`.
           
      List All Export Buckets 
      ```````````````````````
