About the Documentation Project
-------------------------------

This Manual
~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB documentation project aims to provide a complete manual for
the MongoDB database server describing its use, behavior,
operation, and administration. These docs will
eventually replace MongoDB's `original documentation <http://mongodb.org>`_.

Writing Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB Manual uses `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_, a
sophisticated documentation engine built upon `Python Docutils
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`_. The original `reStructured Text
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ files, as well as all
necessary Sphinx extensions and build tools, are available in the same
repository as the documentation.

You can view the documentation style guide and the build instructions
in reSturctured Text files in the top-level of the `documentation
repository <https://github.com/mongodb/docs>`_. If you have any
questions, please feel free to open a :issue:`Jira Case <DOCS>`.
