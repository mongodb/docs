Migrate Parameters to Custom Resource Definitions

Beginning with |ak8so| version 2.6, various resource configurations
that previously took the form of parameters have transitioned to CRDs
of their own. Support for the parameter-based parent resource
configuration is deprecated. Existing parameter-based parent resource 
configurations will continue to work, but support for these 
configurations will be removed in a future release. 

To continue managing these resources
through |ak8so| in the future, migrate to the appropriate CRD.

.. _ak8so-migrate-ptr-considerations:

Resource-Specific Considerations
--------------------------------

Before you migrate parameters to resources, consider any
implementation details specific to those parameters.

.. _ak8so-migrate-ptr-considerations-networkpeering:

Network Peering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following considerations apply to ``atlasNetworkPeering``
resources:

- An ``atlasNetworkPeering`` CRD can refer to its corresponding
  ``atlasNetworkContainer`` by a |k8s| name reference or ID.

- An ``atlasNetworkPeering`` CRD can refer to the ``atlasProject``
  that hosts it by a |k8s| name reference or ID.

- The :setting:`spec.networkPeers` parameter of an ``atlasProject``
  CRD contains details of both the peering connection itself and the
  container that supports it. When you migrate from this parameter to
  an ``atlasNetworkPeering`` CRD, you might need to create an
  ``atlasNetworkContainer`` CRD for the container that supports
  it. To learn more, see :ref:`ak8so-migrate-ptr-considerations-networkcontainer`.

.. _ak8so-migrate-ptr-considerations-networkcontainer:

Network Container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following considerations apply to ``atlasNetworkContainer``
resources:

- You don't need to create a new ``atlasNetworkContainer`` resource
  when you migrate the ``atlasNetworkPeering`` connection from a
  parameter to a resource if either:

  - You manage the network container supporting an ``atlasNetworkPeering``
    connection outside of the |ak8so| ``atlasProject`` in which you
    manage the ``atlasNetworkPeering`` connection
  - An ``atlasNetworkContainer`` resource for the
    ``atlasNetworkPeering`` connection's container already exists.

- An ``atlasNetworkContainer`` CRD can refer to its host
  ``atlasProject`` by a |k8s| name reference or ID.

.. _ak8so-migrate-ptr-procedure:

Migration Procedure
-------------------

To migrate from parameter-level resource management to CRD management:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Disable project reconciliation and edit subresource
      references.

      a. Add the ``mongodb.com/atlas-reconciliation-policy: "skip"``
         annotation to the parent resource's ``metadata``. This
         prevents |ak8so| from attempting to reconcile the parent
         resource and its subresources. 
         
      #. To prevent conflicts with the new CRD you create, you must
         delete the parameters corresponding to the resource you want to
         migrate from the parent resource.
         
      Consider the following example
      of an ``atlasProject`` with a ``customRoles`` configuration:

      .. code-block::
         :copyable: false

         apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
         kind: AtlasProject
         metadata:
           name: my-project
         spec:
           name: Test project
           connectionSecretRef:
             name: my-atlas-key
           customRoles:
             role:
               name: my-role
               actions:
                 - name: getShardMap
                   resources:
                     cluster: true
                 - name: shardingState
                   resources:
                     cluster: true
                 - name: connPoolStats
                   resources:
                     cluster: true
                 - name: getLog
                   resources:
                     cluster: true
                 inheritedRoles:
                   - name: operator-role-1
                     role: backup
            projectIpAccessList:
              - cidrBlock: "203.0.113.0/24"
                comment: "CIDR block for Application Server B - D"

      Ensure that you have added the ``annotations`` block in lines 5 and 6 and remove the 
      ``customRoles`` block shown in the previous example.

      .. code-block::
         :emphasize-lines: 5-6

         apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
         kind: AtlasProject
         metadata:
           name: my-project
         annotations: 
           mongodb.com/atlas-reconciliation-policy: "skip"
         spec:
           name: Test project
           connectionSecretRef:
             name: my-atlas-key
           projectIpAccessList:
             - cidrBlock: "203.0.113.0/24"
               comment: "CIDR block for Application Server B - D"

      .. warning::

         If you do not apply this annotation, |ak8so| will continue
         to attempt reconciliation as you modify your other
         resources. For users with :ref:`<deletion-protection>`
         disabled, this can result in |ak8so| removing the
         |service| project when you remove the ``atlasProject``
         resource, or entering a blocked state attempting to remove
         a project with active subresources such as database users
         or deployments.

   .. step:: Delete the parameters from the parent CRD.

      To prevent conflicts with the new CRD you create, you must first
      delete the parameters corresponding to the resource you want to
      migrate from the parent resource. For example, remove the
      ``customRoles`` parameter from the ``atlasProject`` CRD shown
      previously:

      .. code-block::

        apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
        kind: AtlasProject
        metadata:
         name: my-project
         annotations: 
           mongodb.com/atlas-reconciliation-policy: "skip"
        spec:
          name: Test project
          connectionSecretRef:
            name: my-atlas-key
          projectIpAccessList:
            - cidrBlock: "203.0.113.0/24"
          comment: "CIDR block for Application Server B - D"          

   .. step:: Create the new CRD.

      Create a CRD of the appropriate ``kind`` for the parameter you
      want to migrate, according to its syntax. For example, to
      migrate the ``customRoles`` parameter of the ``atlasProject``
      CRD shown previously, create a
      :ref:`atlascustomrole-custom-resource`.

      .. code-block::

         apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
         kind: AtlasCustomRole
         metadata:
           name: shard-operator-role
           namespace: mongodb-atlas-system
         labels:
           mongodb.com/atlas-reconciliation-policy: keep
         spec:
           projectRef:
             name: my-project
             namespace: my-operator-namespace
         role:
           name: my-role
           actions:
             - name: getShardMap
               resources:
                 cluster: true
             - name: shardingState
               resources:
                 cluster: true
             - name: connPoolStats
               resources:
                 cluster: true
             - name: getLog
               resources:
                 cluster: true
           inheritedRoles:
             - name: operator-role-1
               role: backup

   .. step:: Wait for |ak8so| to sync the new resource status.

   .. step:: Remove the ``atlas-reconciliation-policy: "skip"`` annotation.

Additionally, you can now configure this resource as an
:ref:`Independent CRD <ak8so-independent-crd>`.
