{+rel-mig+} uses JDBC connection strings and associated user
credentials to access your relational database and MongoDB deployment.
You can save this information as a database connection.

After you save a database connection, you can use it for any 
task that requires connecting to a database.

Get Started
-----------

To connect to a source relational database, see the following procedures:

- :ref:`Connect to MySQL <rm-connect-to-mysql>`
- :ref:`Connect to Oracle <rm-connect-to-oracle>`
- :ref:`Connect to PostgreSQL <rm-connect-to-postgres>`
- :ref:`Connect to SQL Server <rm-connect-to-sql-server>`
- :ref:`Connect to Sybase <rm-connect-to-sybase>`
- :ref:`Connect to DB2 <rm-connect-to-db2>`

To connect to a destination database, see :ref:`Connect to MongoDB <rm-connect-to-mongo>`.


Use {+rel-mig+} Without a Live Database Connection
----------------------------------------------------------

If you don't have a live connection to your relational database, you can 
use the following options to visualize and model your data:

- :ref:`Create a project with Data Definition Language (DDL) files <create-project-schema-file>` exported from 
  your relational database.

- :ref:`Create a project using a sample relational database schema <create-project-sample-schema>`.

.. note::

   {+rel-mig+} requires live database connections to perform data migrations.

For more information, see :ref:`<migrator-without-live-connection>`.
