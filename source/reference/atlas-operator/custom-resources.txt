|ak8so| Workflow
----------------

When you use |ak8so|, you can create a new |service| project, or you 
can work with an existing |service| project.

Create and Update Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each time you change the ``spec`` field in any of the supported 
custom resources, the following workflow begins in |ak8so|:

1. |ak8so| receives an event about the changed custom resource.

#. |ak8so| updates the ``status.conditions`` field to reflect that the 
   resource is not ready:

   .. code-block:: sh
      
      conditions:
      - lastTransitionTime: "2021-03-13T16:26:17Z"
        status: "False"
        type: Ready

#. .. include:: /includes/fact-ak8so-orgid-api-key-locations.rst

#. .. include:: /includes/fact-ak8so-connection-information.rst

#. .. include:: /includes/fact-ak8so-connection-errors.rst

#. If the update succeeds, ``status.conditions`` reflects that the 
   resource is ready:

   .. code-block:: sh
    
      conditions:
      - lastTransitionTime: "2021-03-13T16:26:17Z"
        status: "True"
        type: Ready

Delete Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you remove a custom resource from |k8s|, |ak8so| tries to clean the state in |service|, and the following workflow begins:

1. |ak8so| receives an event about the deleted custom resource.

#. To connect to the {+atlas-admin-api+}, |ak8so| reads the 
   organization ID 
   and |api| keys from one of the following locations:

   - :setting:`spec.connectionSecretRef.name` (if specified in 
     ``AtlasProject``).
   - ``global`` |ak8so| |k8s-secret| 
     ``<operator-deployment-name>-api-key`` 
     (if :setting:`spec.connectionSecretRef.name` is not specified).

#. To delete the resource from |service|, |ak8so| uses the connection 
   information to make |api| calls to |service|. 
  
   .. note::

      |ak8so| removes any related objects created in |k8s|. For 
      example, if you remove ``AtlasDatabaseUser``, |ak8so| removes the 
      related connection |k8s-secrets|.
