Overview
--------

Automating backup restorations involve manipulation of the :doc:`automation
configuration </reference/cluster-configuration>`. You first request a restore
link through the ``restoreJobs`` resource and then add the restore link to the
automation configuration using the ``PUT`` method.

You must add the restore link to each :program:`mongod` instance in the
automation configuration's ``processes`` array. For example, for a sharded cluster
you add the restore link to each member process, including each config server.

To automate backup restoration, you must use ``PUT``. **Do not use** ``PATCH``.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must have access to the Public API. For more information, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-public-api-access`.
