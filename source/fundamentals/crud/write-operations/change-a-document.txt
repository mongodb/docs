.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can change documents in a MongoDB collection using two distinct
operation types: **update** and **replace**. Update operations mutate
specified fields in one or more documents and leave other fields and values
unchanged. Replace operations remove all existing fields in one or more
documents and substitute them with specified fields and values.

.. _updateDocuments:

Update
------

To perform an update to one or more documents, create an **update
document** that specifies the **update operator** (the type of update to
perform) and the fields and values that describe the change. Update
documents use the following format:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      <update operator>: {
         <field> : {
            ...
         },
         <field> : {
         }
      },
      <update operator>: {
         ...
      }
   }

The top level of an update document contains one or more of the following
update operators:

- ``$set`` - replaces the value of a field with a specified one
- ``$inc`` - increments or decrements field values
- ``$rename`` - renames fields
- ``$unset`` - removes fields
- ``$mul`` - multiplies a field value by a specified number

See the MongoDB server manual for a :manual:`complete list of update operators
and their usage </reference/operator/update-field/>`.

The update operators apply only to the fields associated with them in your
update document.

Example
~~~~~~~

Consider a document of fields containing the English alphabet of lowercase
letters ``a`` through ``z`` and their ordinal values:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      _id: 465,
      a: 1,
      b: 2,
      c: 3,
      ...
      y: 25,
      z: 26,
   }

If you apply the ``$set`` update operator with a specified value for ``z``, 
your update operation might resemble the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const filter = { _id: 465 };
   // update the value of the 'z' field to 42
   const updateDocument = {
      $set: {
         z: 42,
      },
   };
   const result = await collection.updateOne(filter, updateDocument);

The updated document resembles the following, with an an updated value in
the ``z`` field and all other values unchanged:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      _id: 465,
      a: 1,
      ...
      y: 25,
      z: 42,
   }

If an update operation fails to match any documents in a collection, it
does not make any changes. Update operations can be configured to perform
an :doc:`upsert </fundamentals/crud/write-operations/upsert>` which
attempts to perform an update, but if no documents are matched, inserts
a new document.

You cannot modify the ``_id`` field of a document nor change a field to
a value that violates a unique index constraint. See the MongoDB server manual 
for more information on :manual:`unique indexes </core/index-unique/>`.

.. _replacementDocument:

Replace
-------

To perform a replacement operation, create a **replacement document** that
consists of the fields and values that you would like to insert in your
**replace** operation. Replacement documents use the following format:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      <field>: {
         <value>
      },
      <field>: {
         ...
      }
   }

Replacement documents are the documents that you want to take the place of
existing documents that match the query filters.

Example
~~~~~~~

Consider a document of fields containing the English alphabet of lowercase
letters ``a`` through ``z`` and their ordinal values:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      _id: 465,
      a: 1,
      b: 2,
      c: 3,
      ...
      y: 25,
      z: 26,
   }

Suppose you wanted to replace this document with one that contains only
the field ``z`` with a value of ``42``. Your replacement operation might
resemble the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const filter = { _id: 465 };
   // replace the matched document with the replacement document
   const replacementDocument = {
      z: 42,
   };
   const result = await collection.replaceOne(filter, replacementDocument);

The replaced document contains the contents of the replacement document
and the immutable ``_id`` field as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      _id: 465,
      z: 42,
   }

If a replace operation fails to match any documents in a collection, it
does not make any changes. Replace operations can be configured to perform
an :doc:`upsert </fundamentals/crud/write-operations/upsert>` which
attempts to perform the replacement, but if no documents are matched, it
inserts a new document.

You cannot modify the ``_id`` field of a document nor change a field to
a value that violates a unique index constraint. See the MongoDB server manual
for more information on :manual:`unique indexes </core/index-unique/>`.
