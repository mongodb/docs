Call the :flutter-sdk:`App.deleteUser() <realm/App/deleteUser.html>`
on a user object to delete the user's account from your App Services App.
This deletes the account from the App on the server in addition to clearing local data.

   :language: dart

The user must sign up for a new account to use your App in the future.
Even if the user signs up again with the same credentials,
App Services creates a new user account with a new User ID.
