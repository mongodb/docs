=========================
Revoke Access from a User
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

When a user no longer requires access to certain resources and operations,
remove access by revoking the role that grants it. Revoking a role a user no
longer needs follows the policy of :term:`least privilege`, which gives a user
permissions only for the tasks the user performs.

To revoke privileges, first determine the role that grants the privileges.
Then remove the role with the :method:`db.revokeRolesFromUser` method.

For an overview of roles and privileges, see :ref:`authorization`.
For descriptions of the access each system role provides, see
:ref:`system-defined roles <system-user-roles>.
