  Starting with MongoDB 4.4, the {+dbtools+} are now released separately
  from the MongoDB Server and use their own versioning, with an initial

  alongside the MongoDB Server and used matching versioning.

  For documentation on the MongoDB 4.2 or earlier versions of these
  tools, reference the :manual:`MongoDB Server Documentation
