The :method:`~db.collection.explain` method provides information
on how MongoDB plans and executes the given query. You may find
this information useful when troubleshooting query performance
and planning optimizations.

About This Task
---------------

Explain Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :method:`~db.collection.explain` method is available to
queries that use the following methods:

.. include:: /includes/fact-explain-methods-support

Profilers
~~~~~~~~~

This task runs the :method:`~db.collection.explain` method on a
sample query in an attempt to identify performance issues. In
practice, it may be difficult to run ``explain()`` on every
query your application runs.

To narrow the list of queries to analyze to only those that are
slow, you can use a profiler:

.. include:: /includes/fact-profiler-use

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Explain the query.

      Run the query you want to evaluate with the
      :method:`~db.collection.explain` method:

      .. code-block:: js

         db.movies.explain( "executionStats").find( {
            year: { $gt: 1990 },
            rated: { $in: [ "PG", "PG-13" ] }
         } )

   .. step:: Evaluate the execution time.

      Check the :data:`explain.executionStats.executionTimeMillis` 
      field to see the execution time in milliseconds. This
      shows the total time, including the time it takes to build
      and select a query plan in addition to the time it takes
      the plan to execute.

      - If the execution time is within an acceptable period for
        your application and database needs, no optimization is
        required.

      - If the execution time is above an acceptable period,
        further analysis is required to determine why the query
        takes so long to execute.

   .. step:: Evaluate the execution stages.

      Queries can execute in several stages. At each stage,
      MongoDB collects documents from the previous stage to
      perform the next set of operations.
      :data:`explain.executionStats.executionStages` provides
      information on each execution stage, where each level of the
      :data:`~explain.executionStats.executionStages.inputStage`
      field shows how MongoDB selected documents for the stage.

      Check the :data:`inputStage.stage
      <explain.executionStats.executionStages.inputStage>`
      field for each execution stage:

      ``COLLSCAN``
         Indicates MongoDB performed a collection scan.

      ``IXSCAN``
         Indicates MongoDB performed an index scan.

      ``FETCH``
         Indicates MongoDB fetched full documents from the
         database. 

         If the query returns a small number of fields and the
         application is not write intensive on this collection,
         consider adding indexes to cover the query. This allows
         MongoDB to fetch the field values from the index rather
         than reading the full document.

         For more information, see :ref:`covered-queries`.

      ``PROJECTION``
         Indicates MongoDB filtered return fields in memory.

      ``SORT``
         Indicates MongoDB sorted the documents in memory or
         used a covered index.

      Queries that perform filter or sort operations that show a
      ``COLLSCAN`` stage would benefit from an index.

      For more information, see :ref:`manual-create-an-index`.

   .. step:: Evaluate key examination.

      Queries on collections with indexes may not make effective
      use of the indexes.

      Compare the number of keys examined to the number of
      documents examined. If the number of keys is
      significantly less than the number of documents, it
      indicates the indexes were ineffective.

      Check the total values for the query and ensure that
      :data:`executionStats.totalDocsExamined
      <explain.executionStats.totalDocsExamined>` does not show
      a value greater than
      :data:`executionStats.totalKeysExamined
      <explain.executionStats.totalKeysExamined>`.

      If the number of keys examined is much lower than the
      number of documents examined, check each stage in
      the :data:`~explain.executionStats.executionStages` field,
      comparing the ``keysExamined`` and ``docsExamined`` to
      determine which stage failed to use the index. Then,
      :ref:`create an index <manual-create-an-index>` to
      accommodate the query at that stage.

   .. step:: Evaluate the filter.

      Queries that use filters to specify the results may have
      issues. To identify an inefficient filter, compare the
      value on the :data:`executionStats.totalDocsExamined 
      <explain.executionStats.totalDocsExamined>` field to that
      of the :data:`executionStats.nReturned
      <explain.executionStats.nReturned>` field.

      - If ``totalDocsExamined`` has a value much greater than
        that of ``nReturned``, it indicates an ineffective
        index. That is, MongoDB had to scan the collection in
        order to filter the results.

        :ref:`Create an index <manual-create-an-index>` on the
        filter fields to improve performance.

      - If ``totalDocsExamined`` and ``nReturned`` have the same
        values, it indicates that MongoDB only examined the
        documents that it returned. This indicates an effective
        index.
