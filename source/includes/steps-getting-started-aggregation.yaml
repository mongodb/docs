title: Count number of orders grouped by the ``ord_date``. 
stepnum: 1

  To group by a field, use the :pipeline:`$group` stage operator. In
  the :pipeline:`$group` expression, specify the field to group by, or
  more precisely the field path to group by, in the ``_id`` field.

  To specify a field path, prefix the field name by a dollar sign ``$``
  and enclose in quotes.

  Use the :group:`$sum` operator, which is one of the
  :manual:`accumulator operators for $group
  </meta/aggregation-quick-reference/#group-operators>`, to count the
  documents per group and assign to a field. In this case, the example
  uses the field named ``count``.

title: Count orders grouped by ``ord_date`` and sort by ``ord_date``.
stepnum: 3

  Add a :pipeline:`$sort` stage to the pipeline to sort documents from
  the previous stage.

  In the :pipeline:`$sort` expression, specify in a document the field
  or fields to sort by and the corresponding direction, i.e. ``1`` for
  ascending and ``-1`` for descending. Enclose the field name in quotes.

  The fields in the documents passed into the :pipeline:`$sort` stage
  from the previous stage may not correspond to the fields in the
  collection. For example, the following :pipeline:`$sort` stage sorts
  by the ``_id`` field in the documents passed in from the
  :pipeline:`$group` stage. This ``_id`` field holds values that
  correspond to the ``ord_date`` value.

          { $group: { _id: "$ord_date", count: { $sum: 1 } } },

title: Rename the group by field.
stepnum: 5
ref: ""
pre: |
  The :pipeline:`$project` stage takes the input document and
  determines which fields to include in its output documents. To
  specify that an input field be part of the :pipeline:`$project`
  stage's output, include the field with a ``1`` in the
  :pipeline:`$project` expression.

  With the :pipeline:`$project` stage, you can also calculate new
  fields from values of the input fields. For example, to rename an
  input field, assign to a new field the value of an existing field. To
  refer to the value of the input field, you must use the field path,
  i.e. prefix with ``$`` and enclose in quotes.

  Add the :pipeline:`$project` stage after the
  :pipeline:`$group` stage to rename the ``_id`` field from the
  :pipeline:`$group` stage to ``ord_date``. Then, use the
  :pipeline:`$sort` stage to sort by this newly renamed field.
action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
     db.orders.aggregate(
        [
          { $group: { _id: "$ord_date", count: { $sum: 1 } } },
          { $project: { ord_date: "$_id", count: 1, _id: 0 } },
          { $sort: { "ord_date": 1 } }
        ]
     )
post: |
  The :pipeline:`$project` expression also specifies an inclusion of
  the ``count`` field and a suppression of the ``_id`` field. Except
  for the ``_id`` field, an input field not included in the
  :pipeline:`$project` expression is suppressed from the output of
  :pipeline:`$project`.

  To group by multiple fields, use the :pipeline:`$group` stage
