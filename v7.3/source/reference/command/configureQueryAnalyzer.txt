Definition
------------

.. dbcommand:: configureQueryAnalyzer

   .. versionadded:: 7.0

   Configures query sampling for a collection on a replica set or
   sharded cluster. Sampled queries provide information to
   :dbcommand:`analyzeShardKey` to calculate metrics about read and 
   write distribution of a shard key.

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-all.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

   
Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( 
      {
        configureQueryAnalyzer: <string>,
        mode: <string>,
        samplesPerSecond: <double>
      } 
   )

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Necessity
     - Description
   
   * - ``configureQueryAnalyzer``
     - string
     - Required
     - :term:`namespace` of the collection to configure for query
       sampling.

   * - ``mode``
     - string
     - Required
     - Mode the query analyzer runs in. Must be set to either
       ``"full"`` or ``"off"``.

   * - ``samplesPerSecond``
     - double
     - Optional
     - Number of samples per second.

       - When ``mode`` is set to ``"full"``, ``samplesPerSecond`` must
         be set between ``0`` and ``50``.
       - When ``mode`` is set to ``"off"``, the server ignores
         ``samplesPerSecond``.

       For details, see :ref:`samplesPerSecond Upper Limit 
       <samplesPerSecond-limit>`.

Enable Query Sampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable query sampling on the ``test.students`` collection at a 
rate of five samples per second, use the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand(
      {
        configureQueryAnalyzer: "test.students",
        mode: "full",
        samplesPerSecond: 5
      } 
   )

Disable Query Sampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To disable query sampling on the ``test.students`` collection,
use the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand(
      {
        configureQueryAnalyzer: "test.students",
        mode: "off"
      } 
   )
