.. note:: Supported Aggregation Stages
   
   Atlas App Services supports nearly all MongoDB aggregation pipeline stages and
   operators, but some stages and operators must be executed within a
   :ref:`system function <system-functions>`. See :ref:`Aggregation Framework
   Limitations <mongodb-crud-and-aggregation-apis-aggregation>` for more
   information.
