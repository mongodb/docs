Visualize your database schema by creating data model diagrams in 
|compass-short|. Data model diagrams can help you easily outline relationships 
between collections and analyze your database schema. 

About this Task 
---------------

|compass-short| generates data model diagrams based on a small sample of 
documents from each collection you select in your database. 

If you make any changes to your schema after you generate a diagram, 
|compass-short| does not automatically update the diagram. You must create a new 
diagram to see your changes.

Before You Begin
----------------

To generate a data model diagram, your database must have at least one 
collection with data. 

Steps
-----

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: Open the Data Modeling tab 

      In the left sidebar, click :icon-lg:`Diagram` :guilabel:`Data Modeling`.

   .. step:: Click Generate diagram

   .. step:: Name your diagram

   .. step:: Select your MongoDB connection

      Use the drop-down menu to select which MongoDB connection to use for your
      data model diagram. The :guilabel:`Active` label appears under any 
      currently active connection name.

   .. step:: Select your database 

      Use the drop-down menu to select which database to use for your data model 
      diagram.

   .. step:: Select collections 

      Use the checkboxes to select which collections to include in your data 
      model diagram.

   .. step:: Click Generate 

      |compass-short| generates a data model diagram with the selected 
      collections and displays it in the current tab.
      
      After you generate a diagram, |compass-short| displays the existing 
      diagrams in the :guilabel:`Data Modeling` tab. You can also generate new 
      diagrams from the :guilabel:`Data Modeling` tab by clicking :icon-lg:`Plus` 
      :guilabel:`Generate new diagram` in the upper-right corner of the screen.
