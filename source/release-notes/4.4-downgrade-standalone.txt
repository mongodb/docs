Downgrade Path
--------------

.. include:: /includes/downgrade-path.rst

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-downgrade-floor.rst

.. |downgrading| replace:: downgrading

Create Backup
-------------

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.

Access Control
--------------

If your deployment has access control enabled, your downgrade user
privileges must include privileges to list and manage indexes across
databases. A user with :authrole:`root` role has the required privileges.
      
Prerequisites
-------------

To downgrade from |newversion| to |oldversion|, you must remove
incompatible features that are persisted and/or update incompatible
configuration settings. These include:

.. |target| replace:: :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance

1. Namespace Length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4:

   .. include:: /includes/fact-collection-namespace-limit.rst

   Before downgrading, resolve any collections or views with namespaces
   that exceed the 120-byte :limit:`Namespace Length` limit for Feature
   Compatibility Version (fCV) 4.2.

   To determine if you have any collections or views with namespaces
   that exceed the 120-byte limit, connect :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
   to the |target| and run:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand("listDatabases").databases.forEach(function(d){
         let mdb = db.getSiblingDB(d.name);

         mdb.getCollectionInfos( ).forEach(function(c){
            namespace = d.name + "." + c.name
            namespacelenBytes =  encodeURIComponent(namespace).length

            if (namespacelenBytes > 120) {
               print (c.type.toUpperCase() + " namespace exceeds 120 bytes:: " + namespace )
            }
         } )
      })

   If any collection or view namespace exceeds 120 bytes, then :red:`prior` to
   downgrading the fCV:

   - Rename the collection using the :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command.

   - For views, use :method:`db.createView()` to recreate the view
     using a shorter name, then drop the original view.

2. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version (fCV)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To downgrade the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of your sharded
cluster:

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the |target|.

#. .. include:: /includes/4.4-downgrade-fcv.rst

3. Remove FCV |newversion| Persisted Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps are necessary only if fCV has ever been set to
|newfcv|.

Remove all persisted |newversion| |features| that are incompatible with
|oldversion|. These include:

.. |binary| replace:: the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance

4. Remove |newversion| Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remove all persisted features that use |newversion| features. These
include but are not limited to:

- If any view definitions that include |newversion| operators, such as
  :pipeline:`$unionWith` or :expression:`$function`. See also
  :ref:`4.4-rel-notes-new-agg-operators`.


Procedure
---------

.. warning::

   Before proceeding with the downgrade procedure, ensure that the
   prerequisites have been completed.
