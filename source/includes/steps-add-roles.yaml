     * - Field

       - Description

     * - :guilabel:`Custom Role Name`

       - Name of your custom role.

         .. include:: /includes/fact-custom-role-name-restrictions.rst

     * - :guilabel:`Action or Role`

       - Privileges granted by the role. Click the dropdown to view the
         list of available
         :manual:`privilege actions </reference/privilege-actions/>`
         and :manual:`roles </reference/built-in-roles/>`. 
         
         |service| groups the actions and roles into the following
         categories:
          
         - ``Collection Actions``,
         - ``Database Actions and Roles``,
         - ``Global Actions and Roles``,
         - ``Custom Roles`` (if any)

         Select the action(s)/role(s) from a single category. Once you
         select an action/role, |service| disables the other categories
         with the following exception. If you select an action/role
         from the :guilabel:`Global Actions and Roles`, you can still
         select actions/roles from :guilabel:`Custom Roles`.

         To grant actions and roles from a different category, click
         :guilabel:`Add an action or role` to add a new row.

         .. include:: /includes/fact-custom-roles-compatibility.rst

     * - :guilabel:`Database`

       - Database on which the selected actions and roles
         are granted, if applicable.

         This field is required for all roles and actions under the
         :guilabel:`Collection Actions` and
         :guilabel:`Database Actions and Roles` categories.

     * - :guilabel:`Collection`

       - Collection within the specified database on which
         the actions and roles are granted, if applicable.

         This field is required for all roles and actions under
         :guilabel:`Collection Actions`.

  To grant the same set of privileges on multiple databases and
  collections, click :guilabel:`Add a database or collection`.
