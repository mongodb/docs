Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to serialize **globally unique identifiers**  
(`GUIDs <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamicsax-2012/developer/guids>`__),
also known as **universally unique identifiers** (UUIDs).

.. tip:: ObjectId

   In MongoDB applications, you can use the
   `ObjectId <{+new-api-root+}/api/MongoDB.Bson/MongoDB.Bson.ObjectId.html>`__ type
   as a unique identifier for a document. Consider using ``ObjectId`` instances in place
   of GUIDs in MongoDB applications where possible.

GUIDs in MongoDB
----------------

A GUID is a 16-byte integer that you can use as a unique ID for a MongoDB document.
The following code block shows an example GUID:

.. code-block::
   :copyable: false

  00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff

Originally, MongoDB represented GUIDs as ``BsonBinaryData``
values of :manual:`subtype 3. </reference/bson-types/#binary-data>`
Because subtype 3 didn't standardize the byte order of GUIDs
during encoding, different MongoDB drivers encoded GUIDs with different byte orders.

The following tabs show different driver encodings of the preceding GUID to
``BsonBinaryData`` subtype 3:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+driver-short+}
      :tabid: csharp

      .. code-block:: csharp
         :copyable: false

         33221100-5544-7766-8899-aabbccddeeff

   .. tab:: PyMongo
      :tabid: pymongo

      .. code-block:: python
         :copyable: false

         00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff

   .. tab:: Java Driver
      :tabid: java

      .. code-block:: java
         :copyable: false

         77665544-3322-1100-ffee-ddccbbaa9988

To standardize GUID byte order across applications, we added ``BsonBinaryData`` subtype 4,
which all MongoDB drivers encode in the same way. If your application uses GUIDs, we
recommend using ``BsonBinaryData`` subtype 4 to store them.

For a list of all ``BsonBinaryData`` subtypes, see the
API documentation for the `BsonBinarySubType <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Bson/MongoDB.Bson.BsonBinarySubType.html>`__
enum.

Serializing GUIDs
-----------------

Although we recommend using subtype 4 for all new ``BsonBinaryData`` GUIDs, some older
MongoDB collections might contain some GUID fields that use subtype 3 and others that use
subtype 4. To account for these differences, the {+driver-short+} handles GUID
serialization at the level of individual properties.

The {+driver-short+} uses the ``GuidRepresentation`` enum to represent the different
``BsonBinaryData`` subtypes. The following table shows the ``GuidRepresentation`` enum
members and the corresponding ``BsonBinaryData`` subtypes:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 10 10 

   * - GuidRepresentation Member
     - BsonBinaryData Subtype
   
   * - ``Standard``
     - 4
   
   * - ``CSharpLegacy``
     - 3
   
   * - ``JavaLegacy``
     - 3
   
   * - ``PythonLegacy``
     - 3
   
   * - ``Unspecified``
     - N/A

.. note::
   
   The ``CSharpLegacy``, ``JavaLegacy``, and ``PythonLegacy`` GUID representations are
   all equivalent to ``BsonBinaryData`` subtype 3, but use different byte orders.

The following sections describe the ways in which you can configure GUID representation
in your application.

Configure with Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're using the {+driver-short+} to
:ref:`automap your {+language+} classes to document schemas <csharp-class-mapping>`,
you can add the ``BsonGuidRepresentation`` attribute to a GUID property 
to specify its representation. This attribute accepts a value from the
`GuidRepresentation <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Bson/MongoDB.Bson.GuidRepresentation.html>`__
enum.

The following code example specifies the ``Standard`` GUID representation for the
``G`` property: 

.. code-block:: csharp

   public class Widget
   {
       public int Id { get; set; }

      [BsonGuidRepresentation(GuidRepresentation.Standard)]
      public Guid G { get; set; }
   }

Configure in Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're writing your own serialization code, you can use the 
``GuidSerializer`` class to serialize and deserialize individual GUID values to and 
from BSON fields. To ensure that the driver handles GUIDs correctly, use the 
``GuidRepresentation`` parameter when you construct a ``GuidSerializer``.

The following code sample creates an instance of the ``GuidSerializer`` class 
for serializing properties that use ``BsonBinaryData`` subtype 4: 

.. code-block::

   var guidSerializer = new GuidSerializer(GuidRepresentation.Standard);

If most of your GUIDs use the same representation, you can register a ``GuidSerializer``
globally. To create and register a ``GuidSerializer``, run the following code early
in your application, such as during the bootstrapping phase:

.. code-block:: csharp

   BsonSerializer.RegisterSerializer(new GuidSerializer(GuidRepresentation.Standard));

.. tip::

   When you're working with two ``BsonBinaryData`` subtypes, you can combine a global
   serializer with the  ``BsonGuidRepresentation`` property attribute. For example, you
   can register a global serializer for the most commonly used GUID subtype, then use
   the ``BsonGuidRepresentation`` attribute to denote any GUID properties of another subtype.  

.. important::

   If you don't globally register a serializer, you must apply the ``BsonGuidRepresentation``
   attribute to every serializable GUID property. Otherwise, the driver throws an exception
   when it tries to serialize the property.

Serializing Objects
-------------------

You can use an ``ObjectSerializer`` to serialize hierarchical objects to subdocuments. 
To ensure that GUIDs in these objects are serialized and deserialized correctly,
select the correct GUID representation when constructing your ``ObjectSerializer``. 

The following code sample shows how to 
create an ``ObjectSerializer`` for a GUID representation of subtype 4:

.. code-block:: csharp

   var objectDiscriminatorConvention = BsonSerializer.LookupDiscriminatorConvention(typeof(object));
   var objectSerializer = new ObjectSerializer(objectDiscriminatorConvention, GuidRepresentation.Standard);

If your application relies on an ``ObjectSerializer`` to serialize any GUIDs, you 
must also register the serializer early in your application, such as during the 
bootstrapping phase. The serializer that you 
register will be used globally whenever an object serializer is needed and has not 
been otherwise specified.

To register your ``ObjectSerializer``, pass it to the ``BsonSerializer.RegisterSerializer()``
method:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   var objectDiscriminatorConvention = BsonSerializer.LookupDiscriminatorConvention(typeof(object));
   var objectSerializer = new ObjectSerializer(objectDiscriminatorConvention, GuidRepresentation.Standard);
   BsonSerializer.RegisterSerializer(objectSerializer);
