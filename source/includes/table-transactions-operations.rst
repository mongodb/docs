   * - :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` 
     - :dbcommand:`aggregate`
     - Excluding the following stages:

       - :pipeline:`$collStats`
       - :pipeline:`$currentOp`
       - :pipeline:`$indexStats`
       - :pipeline:`$listLocalSessions`
       - :pipeline:`$listSessions`
       - :pipeline:`$merge`
       - :pipeline:`$out`
       - :pipeline:`$planCacheStats`

   * - :method:`db.collection.countDocuments()` 
     -

     - Excluding the following query operator expressions:
     
       - :query:`$where`
       - :query:`$near`
       - :query:`$nearSphere`

       The method uses the :pipeline:`$match` aggregation stage for the
       query and :pipeline:`$group` aggregation stage with a
       :group:`$sum` expression to perform the count.

   * - :method:`db.collection.distinct()`
     - :dbcommand:`distinct`
     - Available on unsharded collections.
       
       | For sharded collections, use the aggregation pipeline with the
         :pipeline:`$group` stage. See :ref:`transactions-operations-distinct`.

     - For :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>`
       ``"4.4"`` or greater, if the update/replace operation is run
       with ``upsert: true`` against a non-existing collection, the
       collection is implicitly created.

       For fcv ``"4.2"`` or less, if ``upsert: true``, the operation
       must be run against an existing collection.

     - For :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>`
       ``"4.4"`` or greater, when run against a non-existing
       collection, the collection is implicitly created.

       ``"4.4"`` or greater, if run with ``upsert: true`` against a

       and greater, if an insert operation or update operation with
       ``upsert: true`` is run in a transaction against a non-existing
       collection, the collection is implicitly created.

       For fcv ``"4.2"`` or less, the collection must already exist for
       insert and ``upsert: true`` operations.
