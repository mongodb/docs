   When you step down a primary using :method:`rs.stepDown` or
   :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` without setting the ``force`` field to
   ``true``, the stepped-down primary nominates an eligible secondary
   to call an election immediately.

   .. note::

      All writes to the primary fail during the period starting when the
      |command-method-name| |command-method| is received until either a new
      primary is elected, or if there are no electable secondaries, the
      original primary resumes normal operation. 

      Writes that were in progress when |command-method-name| is run
      are killed. In-progress :ref:`transactions <transactions>`
      also fail with :ref:`transient-transaction-error` and can be
      retried as a whole.

      The time period where writes fail is at maximum:

      ``secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs`` (10s by default) +
      :rsconf:`~settings.electionTimeoutMillis` (10s by default).

ref: rs-stepdown-concurrent-ops

   The |command-method-name| |command-method| attempts to
   terminate long running user operations that block the primary
   from stepping down, such as an index build, a write operation or a
   map-reduce job.

ref: rs-stepdown-eligible-secondaries

   The |command-method| then initiates a catchup period where it waits up to
   ``secondaryCatchUpPeriodSeconds``, by default 10 seconds, for a
   secondary to become up-to-date with the primary. The primary only steps
   down if a secondary is up-to-date with the primary during the
   catchup period to prevent :doc:`rollbacks </core/replica-set-rollbacks>`.

   If no electable secondary meets this criterion by the end of the waiting
   period, the primary does not step down and the |command-method| errors.
   |force-option|

   Once the primary steps down successfully, that node cannot become the
   primary for the remainder of the |stepdown-secs| period,
   which began when the node received the |command-method|.

   |command-method-name| |command-method| doesn't close all client 
   connections.
