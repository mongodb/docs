msgid "When a :pipeline:`$sort` immediately precedes a :pipeline:`$limit` in the pipeline, the :pipeline:`$sort` operation only maintains the top ``n`` results as it progresses, where ``n`` is the specified limit, and MongoDB only needs to store ``n`` items in memory. This optimization still applies when ``allowDiskUse`` is ``true`` and the ``n`` items exceed the :ref:`aggregation memory limit <agg-memory-restrictions>`."
