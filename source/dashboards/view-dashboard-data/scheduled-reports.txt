You can create, edit, and delete scheduled reports for your dashboard. 
A scheduled report automatically sends a snapshot of dashboard data to 
a group of users at a regular frequency.

To view your scheduled reports:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal
   
   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-charts.rst
      
   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-reports.rst

.. figure:: /images/charts/charts-dashboard-scheduling-reports.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Reports under the Scheduling label in the Charts dashboard sidebar.

Required Permissions
--------------------

To create, edit, and delete scheduled reports for a dashboard, you must 
have:

- The :guilabel:`Owner` 
  :ref:`dashboard permission <dashboard-permissions>` 
  role for your |charts-short| dashboard.
- Write access to your |service| project through an |service| 
  :atlas:`user role </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>`.

.. note:: 
   
   If you have the :authrole:`Project Owner` user role, you can view all of the 
   scheduled reports in a project. To edit and delete reports for that dashboard, 
   you must also have the :guilabel:`Owner` dashboard role.

Limitations
-----------

- For ``M0`` {+clusters+}, you can create one scheduled report per 
  project.

- For ``M2`` and higher tier {+clusters+}, you can create up to 100 
  scheduled reports per project.

- At this time:

  - Scheduled reports can only be sent by email.
  - If an entire dashboard takes more than five minutes to load, then
    |charts-short| does not take a screenshot for scheduled reports.
