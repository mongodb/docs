MongoDB AI Chatbot Data and Usage Information
=============================================

   :description: Learn how the MongoDB AI Chatbot uses your data.

The MongoDB AI Chatbot is an AI assistant that is able to answer
questions about MongoDB’s products and services, troubleshoot issues,
generate code, and offer advice on how to build your application. The
chatbot is powered by Generative AI and may give inaccurate responses.
See our :doc:`Generative AI FAQ <generative-ai-faq>` for more
information.

The chatbot is available within MongoDB Documentation and across various
other MongoDB properties. It’s also available to use in AI tools from
third parties that partner with MongoDB.

How Your Data is Used
---------------------

MongoDB stores the following information for up to one year:

- The full text of your prompt
- The full text of the generated response
- Feedback data that you provide, such as ratings and text comments
- User engagement data, such as the URL or app from which you used the chatbot

We use your data to operate the chatbot service and to provide a useful
experience. For example, we store anonymous conversation history for
each session so that you can ask follow up questions.

We also use this information to understand how you interact with our
chatbot and to make improvements based on feedback. We evaluate LLM
responses to measure quality and accuracy. We may use your data to
synthesize anonymous test cases for this purpose.

The information that we store is not shared with or sold to any third
parties.

What If I Prefer Not to Use the Chatbot?
----------------------------------------

Currently, our AI chatbot is an integral part of our platform's support
system and, to ensure consistent access to support features for all
users, our AI chatbot cannot be individually disabled. However,
interaction with the chatbot is entirely optional.
