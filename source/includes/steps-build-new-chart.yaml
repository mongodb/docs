    :class: note

    Each chart type provides different visualization options
    for the fields in your data, reflected by various
    *encoding channels*. These channels dictate how your data is
    visualized and enable powerful
    :manual:`aggregations </reference/operator/aggregation/>` for
    your data. For details on the different encoding channel types,
    refer to the :ref:`Encoding Channels <encoding-channels>`
    page.
