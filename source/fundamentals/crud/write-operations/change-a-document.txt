Overview
--------

You can change documents in a MongoDB collection using either **update**
or **replace** operations. Update operations mutate
specified fields in one or more documents and leave other fields and values
unchanged. Replace operations remove all existing fields in one or more
documents and substitute them with specified fields and values.

.. _updateDocuments:

Update
------

To perform an update to one or more documents, create an **update
document** that specifies the **update operator** (the type of update to
perform) and the fields and values that describe the change. Update
documents use the following format:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      <update operator>: {
         <field> : {
            ...
         },
         <field> : {
         }
      },
      <update operator>: {
         ...
      }
   }

The top level of an update document contains one or more of the following
update operators:

- ``$set``: replaces the value of a field with a specified one
- ``$inc``: increments or decrements field values
- ``$rename``: renames fields
- ``$unset``: removes fields
- ``$mul``: multiplies a field value by a specified number

See the MongoDB Server manual for a :manual:`complete list of update operators
and their usage </reference/operator/update-field/>`.

The update operators apply only to the fields associated with them in your
update document.

.. note:: Aggregation Pipelines in Update Operations

   If you are using MongoDB Version 4.2 or later, you can use aggregation
   pipelines made up of a subset of aggregation stages in update operations. For
   more information on the aggregation stages MongoDB supports in
   aggregation pipelines used in update operations, see our tutorial on building
   :manual:`updates with aggregation pipelines </tutorial/update-documents-with-aggregation-pipeline/>`.

Example
~~~~~~~

Consider a document with fields describing an item for sale, its price,
and quantity available:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      _id: 465,
      item: "Hand-thrown ceramic plate",
      price: 32.50,
      quantity: 7,
   }

If you apply the ``$set`` update operator with a new value for
``quantity``, you can use the following update document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const filter = { _id: 465 };

   // update the value of the 'quantity' field to 5
   const updateDocument = {
      $set: {
         quantity: 5,
      },
   };
   const result = await collection.updateOne(filter, updateDocument);

The updated document resembles the following, with an updated value in
the ``quantity`` field and all other values unchanged:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      _id: 465,
      item: "Hand-thrown ceramic plate",
      price: 32.50,
      quantity: 5,
   }

If an update operation fails to match any documents in a collection, it
does not make any changes. Update operations can be configured to perform
an :doc:`upsert </fundamentals/crud/write-operations/upsert>` which
attempts to perform an update, but if no documents are matched, inserts
a new document with the specified fields and values.

You cannot modify the ``_id`` field of a document nor change a field to
a value that violates a unique index constraint. See the MongoDB Server manual
for more information on :manual:`unique indexes </core/index-unique/>`.

.. _node-fundamentals-replaceone:
.. _replacementDocument:

Replace
-------

To perform a replacement operation, create a **replacement document** that
consists of the fields and values that you would like to use in your
**replace** operation. Replacement documents use the following format:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      <field>: {
         <value>
      },
      <field>: {
         ...
      }
   }

Replacement documents are the documents that you want to take the place of
existing documents that match the query filters.

Example
~~~~~~~

Consider a document with fields describing an item for sale, its price,
and quantity available:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      _id: 501,
      item: "3-wick beeswax candle",
      price: 18.99,
      quantity: 10,
   }

Suppose you wanted to replace this document with one that contains a
description for an entirely different item. Your replacement operation might
resemble the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const filter = { _id: 501 };

   // replace the matched document with the replacement document
   const replacementDocument = {
      item: "Vintage silver flatware set",
      price: 79.15,
      quantity: 1,
   };
   const result = await collection.replaceOne(filter, replacementDocument);

The replaced document contains the contents of the replacement document
and the immutable ``_id`` field as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      _id: 501,
      item: "Vintage silver flatware set",
      price: 79.15,
      quantity: 1,
   }

If a replace operation fails to match any documents in a collection, it
does not make any changes. Replace operations can be configured to perform
an :doc:`upsert </fundamentals/crud/write-operations/upsert>` which
attempts to perform the replacement, but if no documents are matched, it
inserts a new document with the specified fields and values.

You cannot modify the ``_id`` field of a document nor change a field to
a value that violates a unique index constraint. See the MongoDB Server manual
for more information on :manual:`unique indexes </core/index-unique/>`.
