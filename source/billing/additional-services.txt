.. _data-lake-billing:

|service| |data-lake|
---------------------

You incur |service| |data-lake| costs for the following items:

- Storage on the cloud object storage
- Data processed by |data-lake|
- Data returned by |data-lake|

Total Data Processed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| charges for the total number of bytes that |data-lake| processes
from your |aws| |s3| buckets, rounded up to the nearest megabyte.
|service| charges **$5.00 per TB** of processed data, with a minimum of
**10 MB** or **$0.00005 per query**.

You can use partitioning strategies and compression in |aws| S3 to
reduce the amount of processed data.

Total Data Returned
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| charges for the total number of bytes returned by
|data-lake|. This total is the sum of the following data transfers:

- The number of bytes transferred between |data-lake| service nodes
- The number of bytes transferred from |data-lake| to the client

The cost of data transfer
depends on the Cloud Service Provider charges for same-region,
region-to-region, or region-to-internet data transfer.

Current pricing can be found at
:website:`MongoDB.com/pricing </pricing>`.

.. _advanced-security:

Advanced Security
-----------------

.. note::

   |service| doesn't support advanced security options for 
   {+serverless-instances+}.

|service| supports
:doc:`Encryption at Rest via customer KMS </security-kms-encryption>`
and :doc:`LDAP User Authentication and Authorization </security-ldaps>`
in |service| projects and clusters.

Excluding |service-fullname| Enterprise and |service-fullname| Platinum
customers, |service| charges a 15% uplift to the cost of each cluster
with **LDAP User Authentication and Authorization** and/or
**Encryption at Rest via customer KMS** enabled.

Configuring **LDAP User Authentication and Authorization** for a
project enables the feature for all clusters in the project.
Configuring **Encryption at Rest via customer KMS** for a project
allows enabling/disabling the feature on per cluster basis.

.. _privatelink-billing:

Private Endpoints
-----------------

MongoDB |service| supports :doc:`private endpoints </security-private-endpoint>`.

.. note::

   |service| doesn't support private endpoints for {+serverless-instances+} 
   during the {+serverless-instance+} preview release.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+aws-pl+}
      :tabid: {+aws-pl+}

      MongoDB |service| supports private endpoints on |aws| using the
      `{+aws-pl+} <https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/>`__ feature.

      |service| charges you based on your usage across these dimensions:

      - |service| :ref:`Private Endpoint 
        <privatelink-billing-endpoint>`: The sum of the hourly costs 
        incurred to host private endpoints in all |aws| regions.
      - |service| :ref:`Private Endpoint Capacity Units 
        <privatelink-billing-cu>`: The sum of the hourly costs incurred 
        to process traffic to private endpoints.

      In addition to the costs |service| charges you, |aws| charges you 
      for each |vpc| interface endpoint you create. To ensure cluster
      availability in the event of a widespread network outage, create 
      |vpc| interface endpoints in at least two availability zones per 
      region. |aws| also charges you for the data volume each |vpc| 
      interface endpoint processes.

      .. seealso::

         `AWS PrivateLink Pricing
         <https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/pricing/>`__.

      .. _privatelink-billing-endpoint:

      |service| Private Endpoint
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      |service| charges hourly for each region to which you deploy a 
      private endpoint. The :ref:`hourly cost <pl-region-rates>` varies 
      by region.

      .. _privatelink-billing-cu:

      |service| Private Endpoint Capacity Units
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Additionally, |service| charges you per hour based on the traffic 
      that your private endpoint processes. The :ref:`hourly cost
      <pl-region-rates>` varies based on the amount of traffic and the 
      region to which your private endpoint is deployed.

      |service| private endpoint capacity units measure the dimensions 
      on which the |service| private endpoint processes your traffic. 
      The dimensions measured are:

      - **New connections or flows**: Number of newly established 
        connections or flows per second.
      - **Active connections or flows**: Peak concurrent connections or
        flows, sampled per minute.
      - **Processed bytes**: The number of bytes processed by the 
        private endpoint in Gigabytes (GB).

      For TCP traffic, an |service| private endpoint capacity unit 
      contains:

      - **New connections or flows**: 800 new TCP connections per 
        second.
      - **Active connections or flows**: 100,000 active TCP connections
        (sampled per minute).
      - **Processed bytes**: 1 GB per hour.

      For UDP traffic, an |service| private endpoint capacity unit 
      contains:

      - **New connections or flows**: 400 new UDP flows per second.
      - **Active connections or flows**: 50,000 active UDP flows 
        (sampled per minute).
      - **Processed bytes**: 1 GB per hour.

      For TLS traffic, an |service| private endpoint capacity unit 
      contains:

      - **New connections or flows**: 50 new TLS connections or flows 
        per second.
      - **Active connections or flows**: 3,000 active TLS connections or
        flows (sampled per minute).
      - **Processed bytes**: 1 GB per hour.

      |service| charges you only for the dimension that has the highest 
      usage during each hour across all traffic types.

      .. example::

         This provides a breakdown of costs for one hour of |tls| 
         network traffic to a private endpoint in the ``us-east-1`` 
         region:

         .. list-table::
            :header-rows: 1
            :widths: 50 25 25

            * - Dimension
              - Amount
              - |service| Private Endpoint Capacity Units Consumed

            * - New connections or flows
              - 25
              - .50

            * - Active connections or flows

            * - Processed bytes
              - 2.5 GB
              - 2.5

      The **Processed bytes** dimension has the largest capacity unit
      consumption rate. For this hour, |service| charges you the 
      following for using |service| private endpoint capacity units in 
      the ``us-east-1`` region:
