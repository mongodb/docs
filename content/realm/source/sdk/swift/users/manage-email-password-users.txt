When you have enabled the :ref:`email/password provider
<email-password-authentication>` in your Atlas App Services app, you can register a new
account, confirm an email address, and reset a user's password from
client code.

.. versionchanged:: 10.16.0
 
   Email/password user APIs add async/await support. Code examples on 
   this page updated to async/await syntax. For an example of the older
   syntax, see: :ref:`Email/Password User Examples with Completion Handlers 
   <ios-manage-users-completion-handler-example>`.

Retry User Confirmation Methods
-------------------------------

The SDK provides methods to resend user confirmation emails or retry custom 
confirmation methods.

Resend a User Confirmation Email
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Resend a :ref:`confirmation email <auth-send-a-confirmation-email>`. The 
confirmation tokens in each URL expire after 30 minutes. If a user does not 
follow the link and confirm within that period, they must request a new 
confirmation email.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ManageEmailPasswordUsers.snippet.resend-confirmation-email.swift
   :language: swift

Retry a User Confirmation Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 10.9.0

Retry a :ref:`custom user confirmation function <auth-run-a-confirmation-function>`. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ManageEmailPasswordUsers.snippet.retry-confirmation-function.swift
   :language: swift

.. _ios-reset-a-users-password:

Reset a User's Password
-----------------------

Resetting a user's password is a multi-step process. 

1. In your client app, you provide a UI for the user to reset their password. 
   Your App Services App can then send an email or run a custom function 
   to confirm the user's identity.
#. After confirming the user's identity, you can complete the password reset 
   request. 
#. After the password reset is complete, the user can log in using the new 
   password.

For more information about how to set your preferred password reset method,
refer to the :ref:`App Services Email/Password Authentication documentation 
<email-password-authentication-password-resets>`.

Send a Password Reset Email
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To send password reset emails to confirm the user's identity, 
you must configure your App to :ref:`send a password reset email 
<auth-send-a-password-reset-email>`.

To begin the password reset process, call ``sendResetPasswordEmail`` 
with the user's email. App Services sends an email to the user that contains 
a unique URL. The user must visit this URL within 30 minutes to confirm 
the reset.

After the user has visited the URL from the password reset email, call 
``resetPassword`` with the user's email, the new password, and the ``token`` 
and ``tokenId`` provided in the unique URL.

If the user does not visit the URL from the password reset email within 30 
minutes, the ``token`` and ``tokenId`` expire. You must begin the password 
reset process again.

         :language: objectivec

Run a Password Reset Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you configure your app to :ref:`run a password reset function 
<auth-run-a-password-reset-function>`, you define the function that 
should run when you call :swift-sdk:`callResetPasswordFunction() 
<Extensions/EmailPasswordAuth.html#/s:So20RLMEmailPasswordAuthC10RealmSwiftE09callResetB8Function5email8password4args7Combine6FutureCyyts5Error_pGSS_SSSayAC7AnyBSONOGtF>` 
from the SDK. This function can take a username, a password, and any number 
of additional arguments. You can use these arguments to specify details 
like security question answers or other challenges that the user should 
pass to successfully complete a password reset.

You might prefer to use a custom password reset function when you want to
define your own password reset flows. For example, you might send a custom 
password reset email from a specific domain. Or you might use a service other 
than email to confirm the user's identity.

On the App Services side, you define the custom password reset function that
runs when you call this method. That function can return one of three possible
statuses:

- ``fail``
- ``pending``
- ``success``

A ``fail`` status is treated as an error by the SDK. The SDK ``callResetPasswordFunction()``
does not take return values, so it does not return a ``pending`` or ``success``
status to the client. 

Server-Side Pending Case
````````````````````````

Your :ref:`App Services password reset function 
<auth-run-a-password-reset-function>` may return ``pending`` if you want 
the user to take some additional step to confirm their identity. However, that
return value is not passed to the SDK's ``callResetPasswordFunction()``, so 
your client app must implement its own logic to handle a ``pending`` status.

Your server-side function might send an email using a custom email provider. 
Or you may use SMS to confirm the user's identity via text message. 

You have access to a ``token`` and ``tokenId`` in the App Services password 
reset function context. If you pass this information from your App Services 
password reset function, you can pass these values back to your app using
:apple:`universal links <ios/universal-links/>`. Then, your client 
application can call ``resetPassword`` to complete the password reset flow.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ManageEmailPasswordUsers.snippet.password-reset-function-pending.swift
   :language: swift

Server-Side Success Case
````````````````````````

If your :ref:`App Services password reset function 
<auth-run-a-password-reset-function>` does additional validation within 
the function, or if you have validated the user's identity prior to 
attempting to reset the password, you may configure the App Services function
to return ``success``. However, that return value is not passed to the SDK's 
``callResetPasswordFunction()``, so your client app must implement its 
own logic to handle a ``success`` status.

Calling the function in this example performs the entire password reset process.

Email/Password User Methods with Completion Handlers
----------------------------------------------------

If you're not using :apple:`Apple's async/await syntax
<documentation/swift/swift_standard_library/concurrency/updating_an_app_to_use_swift_concurrency>`, 
all of these methods are available with completion handlers. This example 
shows :ref:`registering a user <ios-register-a-new-user-account>` with the 
completion handler syntax.
