  The code example performs the following tasks:

  - Imports ``mongodb``, MongoDB's Node.js driver.
  - Creates an instance of the ``MongoClient`` class to establish a 
    connection to your |service| cluster.
  - Runs a query that uses:

    - :pipeline:`$search` stage to look for a term
    - :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the output to 5 results
    - :pipeline:`$project` stage to exclude all fields except ``title`` 
      and ``plot``

  - Iterates over the cursor to print the documents that match the 
    query.
