.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: text

   .. versionadded:: 2.4

   The :dbcommand:`text` command provides an interface to search text
   context stored in the :ref:`text index <index-feature-text>`. By
   default, the command limits the matches to the top 100 scoring
   documents, in descending score order, but you can specify a
   different limit. The :dbcommand:`text` command is
   **case-insensitive**.

   The :dbcommand:`text` has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.runCommand( "text", { search: <string>,
                                          filter: <document>,
                                          project: <document>,
                                          limit: <number>,
                                          language: <string> } )

   The :dbcommand:`text` command has the following parameters:

   :param string search:

          A string of terms that MongoDB parses and uses to query the
          ``text`` index. The :dbcommand:`text` command returns all
          documents that contain any of the terms; i.e. it performs a
          logical ``OR`` search.

          Enclose the string of terms in escaped double quotes to match
          on the phrase.

          Additionally, the :dbcommand:`text` command treats most
          punctuation as delimiters, except when a hyphen '-' is used
          to negate terms.

          Prefixing a word with a minus sign (-) negates a word:

          - The negated word excludes documents that contain the
            negated word from the result set.

          - A search string that only contains negative words returns
            **no** match.

          - A hyphenated word, such as ``pre-market``, is not a
            negation. The text command treats the hyphen as a delimiter.

   :param document filter:

          Optional. A :ref:`query document <mongodb-query-document>` to
          further limit the results of the query using another database
          field. You can use any valid MongoDB query in the filter
          document, except if the index includes an ascending or
          descending index field as a prefix.

          If the index includes an ascending or descending index field
          as a prefix, the ``filter`` is required and the ``filter``
          query must be an equality match.

   :param document project:

          Optional. Allows you to limit the fields returned by the
          query to only those specified.

          By default, the ``_id`` field returns as part of the result
          set *unless* you explicitly exclude the field in the project
          document.

   :param number limit:

          Optional. Specify the maximum number of documents to include
          in the response. The :dbcommand:`text` sorts the results
          before applying the ``limit``.

          The default limit is 100.

   :param string language:

          Optional. Specify the language that determines for the search
          the list of stop words and the rules for the stemmer and
          tokenizer. If not specified, the search uses default language
          of the index. See :ref:`text-search-languages` for the
          supported languages. Specify the language in **lowercase**.

   :return:

            A document that contains a field ``results`` that contains
            an array of the highest scoring documents, in descending
            order by score. See :ref:`text-search-output` for details.

            The returned document must fit within the :limit:`BSON
            Document Size`. Use the ``limit`` and the ``project``
            parameters to limit the size of the result set.

   .. note::

      - If the ``search`` string includes phrases, the search performs
        an ``AND`` with any other terms in the search string; e.g.
        search for ``"\"twinkle twinkle\" little star"`` searches for
        ``"twinkle twinkle"`` **and** (``"little"`` **or** ``"star"``).

      - :dbcommand:`text` adds all negations to the query with the
        logical ``AND`` operator.

      - The :dbcommand:`text` command ignores stop words for the search
        language language, such as ``the`` and ``and`` in English.

      - The :dbcommand:`text` command matches on the complete *stemmed*
        words. So if a document field contains the word ``blueberry``,
        a search on the term ``blue`` will not match. However,
        ``blueberry`` or ``blueberries`` will match.

   For the following examples, assume a collection ``articles`` has a text
   index on the field ``subject``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.articles.ensureIndex( { subject: "text" } )

   .. example:: Search for a Single Word

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.articles.runCommand( "text", { search: "coffee" } )

      This query returns documents that contain the word ``coffee``,
      case-insensitive, in the indexed ``subject`` field.

   .. example:: Search for Multiple Words

      The following command searches for ``bake`` or ``coffee`` or ``cake``:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.articles.runCommand( "text", { search: "bake coffee cake" } )

      This query returns documents that contain either ``bake`` **or**
      ``coffee`` **or** ``cake`` in the indexed ``subject`` field.

   .. example:: Search for a Phrase 

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.articles.runCommand( "text", { search: "\"bake coffee cake\"" } )

      This query returns documents that contain the phrase ``bake
      coffee cake``.

   .. example:: Exclude a Term from the Result Set

      Use the hyphen (``-``) as a prefix to exclude documents that
      contain a term. Search for documents that contain the words
      ``bake`` or ``coffee``, but does **not** contain ``cake``:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.articles.runCommand( "text", { search: "bake coffee -cake" } )

   .. example:: Search with Additional Query Conditions

      Use the ``filter`` option to include additional query conditions.

      Search for a single word ``coffee`` with an additional filter on
      the ``about`` field, but limit the results to 2 documents
      with the highest score and return only the ``subject`` field in
      the matching documents:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.articles.runCommand( "text", {
                                           search: "coffee",
                                           filter: { about: /desserts/ },
                                           limit: 2,
                                           project: { subject: 1, _id: 0 }
                                         }
                               )

      - The ``filter`` :ref:`query document <mongodb-query-document>`
        may use any of the available :doc:`query operators
        </reference/operator>`.

      - Because the ``_id`` field is implicitly included, in order to
        return **only** the ``subject`` field, you must explicitly
        exclude (``0``) the ``_id`` field. Within the ``project``
        document, you cannot mix inclusions (i.e. ``<fieldA>: 1``) and
        exclusions (i.e. ``<fieldB>: 0``), except for the ``_id`` field.

   .. example:: Search a Different Language

      Use the ``language`` option to specify Spanish as the language
      that determines the list of stop words and the rules for the
      stemmer and tokenizer:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.articles.runCommand( "text", {
                                             search: "leche",
                                             language: "spanish"
                                         }
                               )

      See :ref:`text-search-languages` for the supported languages.
      
      .. important:: Specify the language in **lowercase**.
