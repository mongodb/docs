.. dbcommand:: convertToCapped

   The :dbcommand:`convertToCapped` command converts an existing,
   non-capped collection to a :term:`capped collection` within the same
   database.

   The command has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {convertToCapped: <collection>, size: <capped size> }

   :dbcommand:`convertToCapped` takes an existing collection
   (``<collection>``) and transforms it into a capped collection with
   a maximum size in bytes, specified to the ``size`` argument
   (``<capped size>``).

   During the conversion process, the :dbcommand:`convertToCapped`
   command exhibit the following behavior:

   - MongoDB transverses the documents in the original collection in
     :term:`natural order` and loads the documents into a new
     capped collection.

   - If the ``capped size`` specified for the capped collection is
     smaller than the size of the original uncapped collection, then
     MongoDB will overwrite documents in the capped collection based
     on insertion order, or *first in, first out* order.

   - Internally, to convert the collection, MongoDB uses the following
     procedure

     - :dbcommand:`cloneCollectionAsCapped` command creates the capped
       collection and imports the data.

     - MongoDB drops the original collection.

     - :dbcommand:`renameCollection` renames the new capped collection
       to the name of the original collection.

   .. note::

      MongoDB does not support the :dbcommand:`convertToCapped`
      command in a sharded cluster.

   .. warning::

      The :dbcommand:`convertToCapped` will not recreate indexes from
      the original collection on the new collection, other than the
      index on the ``_id`` field. If you need indexes on this
      collection you will need to create these indexes after the
      conversion is complete.
