Overview
--------

In a :term:`sharded cluster`, the balancer process is responsible for
distributing sharded data around the cluster, so that each
:term:`shard` has roughly the same amount of data.

However, when creating backups from a sharded cluster it is important
that you disable the balancer while taking backups to ensure that no
chunk migrations affect the content of the backup captured by the
backup procedure. Using the procedure outlined in the section
:ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily` you can manually stop the
balancer process temporarily. As an alternative, you can
use the following procedure to define a balancing window so that the balancer
is always disabled during your automated backup operation.

Procedure
---------

If you have an automated backup schedule, you can disable all
balancing operations for a period of time. For instance, consider the
following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use config
   db.settings.update( { _id : "balancer" }, { $set : { activeWindow : { start : "06:00", stop : "23:00" } } }, true )

This operation configures the balancer to run between 6:00am and
11:00pm, server time. Schedule your backup operation to run *and
complete* outside of this time. Ensure that the backup can complete
outside the window when the balancer is running *and* that the
balancer can effectively balance the collection among the shards
in the window allotted to each.
