MongoDB drivers use a Server Selection algorithm to choose which
replica set member to use or, when connected to multiple
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances, which :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance to use.

Server selection occurs once per operation.

Read Preference for Replica Sets
--------------------------------

Server selection occurs once per operation and is governed by the
:doc:`read preference </core/read-preference>` and ``localThresholdMS``
settings to determine member eligibility for reads. The read preference
is re-evaluated for each operation.

Read Preference for Sharded Clusters
------------------------------------

Load Balancing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there is more than one :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance in the connection
seed list, the driver determines which :binary:`~bin.mongos` is the
"closest" (i.e. the member with the lowest average network
round-trip-time) and calculates the latency window by adding the
average round-trip-time of this "closest" :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance
and the ``localThresholdMS``. The driver will load balance randomly
across the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances that fall within the latency
window.

.. _read-preference-mechanics-sharded-cluster:

Read Preference and Shards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For sharded clusters that have replica set shards, :binary:`~bin.mongos`
applies the read preference when reading from the shards. Server
selection is governed by the :doc:`read preference
</core/read-preference>` and :setting:`replication.localPingThresholdMs`
settings. The read preference is re-evaluated for each operation.

Hedged Reads
````````````

Starting in version 4.4, :binary:`~bin.mongos` supports :ref:`hedged
reads <mongos-hedged-reads>` for non-``primary`` :doc:`read preferences
</core/read-preference>` modes. That is, :binary:`~bin.mongos` can send
an additional read to another member, if available, to hedge the read
operation if using non-``primary`` :doc:`read preferences
</core/read-preference>`. The additional read sent to hedge the read
operation uses the ``maxTimeMS`` value of
:parameter:`maxTimeMSForHedgedReads`.

.. include:: /includes/list-hedged-reads-operations.rst

To use hedged reads:

- the :binary:`~bin.mongos` must have enabled support for hedged reads
  (Default). See the :parameter:`readHedgingMode` parameter.

- Non-``primary`` :doc:`read preferences </core/read-preference>` must
  enable use of hedged reads.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/server-selection-read-preference-sharded-clusters.rst

.. [#default-threshold]  The default threshold value is 15 milliseconds.
