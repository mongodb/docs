MongoDB Compatibility
---------------------
The following compatibility table specifies the recommended versions of
the {+driver-long+} for use with MongoDB.

The first column lists the driver version.

.. sharedinclude:: dbx/lifecycle-schedule-callout.rst

.. sharedinclude:: dbx/compatibility-table-legend.rst

.. include:: /includes/mongodb-compatibility-table-node.rst

Language Compatibility
----------------------

The following compatibility table specifies the supported versions of
the {+driver-long+} for use with a specific version of Node.js.

The first column lists the driver version.

.. include:: /includes/language-compatibility-table-node.rst

.. note:: The {+driver-short+} Supports Node.js Versions in the "Active LTS" Phase or Later

   After release, Node.js versions have a "Current" release status for six months 
   to give library authors time to add support for them. The {+driver-long+} 
   officially supports a Node.js version once the release status moves 
   to "Active LTS", which means the version is ready for general use. To learn 
   more about release statuses for Node.js versions, see 
   `Node.js Releases <https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases>`__
   on the Node.js site.

Component Compatibility
-----------------------
The following table describes add-on component version compatibility for
versions of the {+driver-long+}. Any other combination of packages might be
unstable.
