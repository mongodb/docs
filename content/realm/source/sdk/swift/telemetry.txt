Apple Privacy Manifest
----------------------

The Swift SDK does not include analytics in builds for the App Store. Because
we do not collect telemetry on those builds, the SDK's Apple privacy manifest
does not mention this telemetry. The SDK's Apple privacy manifest only covers
Apple's API disclosure requirements.

For more details, refer to :ref:`ios-apple-privacy-manifest`.
