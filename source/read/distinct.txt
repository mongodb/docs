Overview
--------

Within a collection, different documents might contain different values for a single field.
For example, one document in the ``restaurant`` collection has a ``borough`` value of ``"Manhattan"``, and
another has a ``borough`` value of ``"Queens"``. With the {+driver-short+}, you can
retrieve all the distinct values that a field contains across multiple documents
in a collection.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see
:ref:`<java-rs-getting-started>`.

``distinct()`` Method
---------------------

To retrieve the distinct values for a specified field, call the ``distinct()``
method and pass in the name of the field you want to find distinct values for.

Retrieve Distinct Values Across a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example retrieves the distinct values of the ``borough`` field in
the ``restaurants`` collection:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/read-ops/distinct.java
      :start-after: start-distinct
      :end-before: end-distinct
      :language: java
      :dedent:

   .. output::

      Bronx
      Brooklyn
      Manhattan
      Missing
      Queens
      Staten Island

The results show every distinct value that appears in the ``borough`` field
across all documents in the collection. Although several documents have the same
value in the ``borough`` field, each value appears in the results only once.

Retrieve Distinct Values Across Specified Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can provide a **query filter** to the ``distinct()`` method to find the distinct
field values across a subset of documents in a collection. A query filter is an expression that specifies search
criteria used to match documents in an operation. For more information about
creating a query filter, see :ref:`java-rs-specify-query`.

The following example retrieves the distinct values of the ``borough`` field for
all documents that have a ``cuisine`` field value of ``"Italian"``:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/read-ops/distinct.java
      :start-after: start-distinct-query
      :end-before: end-distinct-query
      :language: java
      :dedent:

   .. output::

      Bronx
      Brooklyn
      Manhattan
      Queens
      Staten Island

Modify Distinct Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``distinct()`` method can be modified by chaining methods to the ``distinct()`` method
call. If you don't specify any options, the driver does not customize the operation.

The following table describes some methods you can use to customize the
``distinct()`` operation:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``batchSize()``
     - | Sets the number of documents to return per batch. By default, returns an initial batch size 
         of ``101`` documents and a maximum size of 16 mebibytes (MiB) for each subsequent batch. 
         This option can enforce a smaller limit than 16 MiB, but not a larger one.
      
       | A ``batchSize`` of ``0`` means that the cursor will be established, but no documents 
         will be returned in the first batch.

   * - ``collation()``
     - | Specifies the kind of language collation to use when sorting
         results. For more information, see :manual:`Collation </reference/collation/#std-label-collation>`
         in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``comment()``
     - | Specifies a comment to attach to the operation.

   * - ``filter()``
     - | Sets the query filter to apply to the query.

   * - ``maxTime()``
     - | Sets the maximum amount of time to allow the operation to run, in milliseconds.

For a complete list of methods you can use to modify the ``distinct()`` method, see
the `DistinctPublisher <{+api+}/mongodb-driver-reactivestreams/com/mongodb/reactivestreams/client/DistinctPublisher.html>`__ API documentation.

The following example retrieves the distinct values of the ``name`` field for
all documents that have a ``borough`` field value of ``"Bronx"`` and a
``cuisine`` field value of ``"Pizza"``. It also uses
the ``comment`` option to add a comment to the operation.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/read-ops/distinct.java
      :start-after: start-distinct-comment
      :end-before: end-distinct-comment
      :language: java
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 

      $1.25 Pizza
      18 East Gunhill Pizza
      2 Bros
      Aenos Pizza
      Alitalia Pizza Restaurant
      ...
