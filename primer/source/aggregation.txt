Data Aggregation

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MongoDB can perform aggregation operations, such as grouping by a
specified key and evaluating a total or a count for each distinct group.

MongoDB provides the :method:`~db.collection.aggregate()` method to
perform a stage-based aggregation. The
:method:`~db.collection.aggregate()` method accepts as its argument an
array of stages, where each :manual:`stage
</meta/aggregation-quick-reference>`, processed sequentially, describes
a data processing step.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.aggregate( [ <stage1>, <stage2>, ... ] )

Prerequisite
------------

The examples in this section query the ``inventory`` collection in the
``test`` database. To populate the collection, see
:doc:`/tutorial/prerequisite`.
