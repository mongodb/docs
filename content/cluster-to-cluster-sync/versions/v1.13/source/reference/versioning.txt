{+c2c-product-name+} uses `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0
<https://semver.org/>`__. Version numbers have the form ``X.Y.Z``, where
``X`` is the major version, ``Y`` is the minor version, and ``Z`` is the
patch version.

MongoDB uses the following guidelines to determine when to increment the
version number for {+c2c-product-name+}: 

- Major number: The release breaks backwards compatibility.
- Minor number: The release includes significant new features that are
  backwards compatible.
- Patch number: This release only includes small, backwards compatible
  changes.

Currently Supported Versions
----------------------------

MongoDB only supports the latest patch release of each major
version.  For example, ``mongosync`` {+latest-version+} is the
latest patch release of {+version+}. If you are using an
unsupported version of ``mongosync``, you might be asked to
upgrade in order to receive support.

Version-Related Considerations
------------------------------

{+c2c-product-name+} has the following version related considerations:

Support Lifecycle 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Major releases are supported for at least one year from the first
  release in that series.
- If a version of {+c2c-product-name+} only works with an unsupported 
  version of MongoDB Server, that version of {+c2c-product-name+} is
  also unsupported.

Patch Releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only the latest version in each major release series receives new patch
releases. For example, when version {+c2c-product-name+} 2.1.0 is
released, version 2.0 would no longer receive patch releases. At the
same time, version 1.3 would continue to receive patches until version
1.4 was released.

Upgrade or Downgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   ``mongosync`` supports live upgrades from v1.12 to v1.13. 

Use the following steps to upgrade or downgrade ``mongosync``:

- Stop all currently running ``mongosync`` processes.
- Drop all non-system databases in the destination cluster.
- :ref:`Install <c2c-install>` new ``mongosync`` binaries.
- :ref:`Start <c2c-api-start>` the ``mongosync`` processes using the new
  binaries.

.. warning::
 
   The new ``mongosync`` processes do not resume any work that may have
   been in progress. Syncing operations restart from the beginning when
   you start the new processes.

Persistent Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During normal operation, ``mongosync`` creates metadata that is
persisted to disk in the destination database. This metadata is not
versioned and may change at any time.

Log Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Log message formats are not versioned and may change at any time. This
includes changes to the message text, as well as the presence, absence,
or contents of other fields in the message. 

User scripts and applications should not rely on logging output. Scripts
and applications should use the :ref:`monitoring API <c2c-api-progress>`
to determine the current state of ``mongosync``.

Examples
--------

The following examples illustrate the kinds of changes that would result
in each type of version number update. 

Major Releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changes that make the new and old versions of ``mongosync`` produce
  different results on the  destination cluster for the same set of
  inputs. Except:

  - Bug fixes for cases where the older version of ``mongosync`` fails
    to replicate data.
  - When the earlier behavior is explicitly documented as unsupported.

- Changes to documented CLI parameters or configuration keys such that
  ``mongosync`` rejects formerly valid input. Except:

  - Bug fixes such as parsing or type errors.
  - Even though CLI parameters or configuration keys may be deprecated,
    the meaning of documented CLI parameters or configuration keys will
    never change. If needed, new parameters or keys will replace the
    older, deprecated entities. 

- Changes that break compatibility with a supported version of MongoDB
  Server.
- Dropping a version of the REST API. ``mongosync`` may drop all
  older endpoints in favor of a new version of the API. There will never
  be any other types of backwards incompatible changes in the REST API.
- Removing support for a previously supported MongoDB Server feature if
  ``mongosync`` still supports a version of MongoDB Server that supports
  the feature.
- If ``mongosync`` already supports a major version of MongoDB Server,
  changes that require new access privileges in order to continue
  supporting that version of MongoDB Server.

Minor Releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adding support for a previously incompatible MongoDB Server version.
- Requiring new access privileges for a previously unsupported major
  release of MongoDB Server.
- Adding support for previously unsupported collection types.
- Adding support for previously unsupported index types.
- Adding new endpoints, new fields, or new accepted inputs in the REST API.
- Adding new documented CLI options.
- Adding new configuration keys or accepted values.

Patch Releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Backwards compatible bug fixes.
- Performance regression fixes.
- Performance improvements.
- Changes to help text strings.
- Changes to log text strings.
- Changes to informational text in API responses, but not changes to
  enum-style string fields like "state".
- Typo fixes.
