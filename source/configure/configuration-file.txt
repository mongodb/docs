{+mcli+} Configuration File
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

   :class: singlecol

The {+mcli+} configuration file stores your profiles. You can update the
settings stored in your configuration file by editing the file with a
text editor or by using the :ref:`mcli-config-set-command` command.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/secure-config-file.rst

Configuration File Location
---------------------------

The first time you run the :ref:`mcli-config-command` command, the
{+mcli+} creates a configuration file called ``mongocli.toml``. The
{+mcli+} grants the user who ran the command read and write access to
the file. The {+mcli+} saves the configuration file to the folder where
the system stores application configuration files, which is defined by
the ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` environment variable. By default, this location
is the ``/.config`` folder of the user's home directory. If this folder
doesn't exist, the {+mcli+} creates the folder and grants the user read,
write, and execute permissions.

.. _mcli-profiles:

Profiles
--------

The {+mcli+} configuration file stores related settings and
|api| keys in groups called *profiles*. You can :ref:`create
<mcli-config-command>` or :ref:`define <mcli-config-set-command>`
multiple profiles so that you can use the {+mcli+} to access different
MongoDB services or projects from the same terminal.

.. note:: 

   Any settings stored in :ref:`envronment variables <mcli-env-var>`
   take precedence over settings stored in profiles.

To run {+mcli+} with a specific profile, append the ``--profile
<profileName>`` option to the command. 

Default Profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you run a command without the ``--profile`` option, the {+mcli+} uses
the settings in the default profile. The {+mcli+} determines the default
profile by the number of profiles you have configured:

- If you have only one profile, the {+mcli+} uses that profile as the 
  default. 
- If you have multiple profiles, the {+mcli+} uses the profile named 
  ``default`` as the default. If you don't have a profile named
  ``default`` and run a command that requires certain settings, the 
  {+mcli+} returns an error for the missing settings.

Example
-------

The following example configuration file contains two profiles,
``default`` and ``myOpsManager``. 

The ``default`` profile connects to an |service| deployment and contains
the following settings:

- An organization ID
- |api| keys
- A project ID

The ``myOpsManager`` profile connects to an |onprem| deployment and
contains the following settings:

- The |onprem| base |url|.
- An organization ID.
- |api| keys.
- A project ID.
- **Optional** The full path on your local system to the PEM-encoded
  Certificate Authority (CA) certificate used to sign the client and
  |onprem| TLS certificates
- **Optional** Flag indicating whether the CA TLS certificate is
  verified.

.. code-block:: text
   :copyable: false

   # ~/.config/mongocli.toml

   [default]
     organization_id = "qwer5678uiop23jb45lk78mn"
     public_api_key = "ABCDEFG"
     project_id= "5e2f04ecf10fcd33c7d4077e"
     private_api_key = "e750d2bf-1234-4cde-5678-ca4dcbcac9a4"
     service = "cloud"

   [myOpsManager]
     ops_manager_ca_certificate = /etc/ssl/certs/ca.pem
     ops_manager_skip_verify = no
     ops_manager_url = "http://localhost:9080/"
     organization_id = "jklsa23123dsdf3jj456hs2"
     public_api_key = "HIJKLMN"
     project_id = "kk12jdn43jd123dkdkf97jg"
     private_api_key = "e750d2bf-9101-4cde-1121-ca4dcbcac9a5"
     service = "ops-manager"

To use {+mcli+} with the ``default`` profile, omit the ``--profile``
option from the command:

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: false

   mongocli <command>

To use {+mcli+} with the ``myOpsManager`` profile, append the
``--profile myOpsManager`` option to the command:

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: false

   mongocli <command> --profile myOpsManager
