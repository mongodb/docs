Considerations
--------------

The following considerations apply to making backups highly available:

- The |application| manages backups. To meet your backup needs, deploy
  a sufficient number of |onprem| hosts with a load balancer.

- |onprem| expects that all stores are available at all times. High
  availability of |s3| and filesystem stores is outside of the |application|
  scope.

- :manual:`Create a replica set </tutorial/deploy-replica-set>` rather
  than a standalone for each :doc:`dedicated MongoDB process
  </tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>` that hosts the
  |application| and for each backing database. A backing database can
  include a MongoDB blockstore snapshot store, a MongoDB oplog store,
  or an |s3| metadata store.
  
  |onprem| uses ``w: 2`` :manual:`write concern </reference/write-concern>`,
  which requires acknowledgement from the :manual:`primary </reference/glossary/#std-term-primary>` and one
  :manual:`secondary </reference/glossary/#std-term-secondary>` for each write operation. When deploying a replica set
  with members in many facilities, ensure that a single facility has enough
  votes to elect a primary, if needed. When choosing between facilities
  for this single facility, choose the facility that hosts the |application|
  and application database. Place a majority of voting members and all the
  members that can become primary in this facility. Otherwise, network
  partitions could prevent the set from being able to form a majority. 

  To learn more, see:

  - :manual:`Replica Sets Distributed Across Two or More Data Centers
    </core/replica-set-architecture-geographically-distributed/>`
  - :manual:`Replica Set Elections </core/replica-set-elections>`

- If you choose to
  :doc:`assign snapshot stores to specific data centers
  </tutorial/assign-snapshot-stores-to-data-center/>`, consider each region's
  high availability requirements based on your deployment needs. For example,
  in some deployments, configuring a replica set may provide sufficient
  availability. If your deployment has 24/7 high availability requirements
  even if a data center goes down, configure enough nodes in each data
  center to accommodate writes. To learn more, see :ref:`highly-available-deployment`.

- Configure more than one :opsmgr:`Backup Daemon </reference/glossary/#std-term-backup-daemon>` instance for
  :doc:`queryable restore jobs </tutorial/query-backup>` and
  :ref:`groom jobs <grooms-page>`, which are useful for large deployments.

  For each Backup Daemon, you can:

  - :doc:`Assign Backup jobs </tutorial/assign-snapshot-stores-to-data-center>`.
    If you don't assign jobs to specific daemons and stores, |mms| uses
    all available Backup Daemons for each group.

  - Adjust the settings on the :guilabel:`Daemon` :ref:`configuration <daemons-interface>`
    page. For example, for the dedicated queryable Daemon host, you can
    clear all checkboxes except :guilabel:`Queryable Restore Jobs`.

Additional Information
----------------------

- You install the Backup Daemon component with the |onprem| package.
  To run the Daemon, you must activate it. To learn more, select the
  procedure specific to your platform in the :doc:`/installation` section.

- To view all active Backup Daemons and access their configuration options,
  see :ref:`Daemons <daemons-interface>`.

- To start and stop a Backup Daemon on a server, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/start-and-stop-backup-daemon`.

- To move jobs from a lost Backup server to another Backup server, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/move-jobs-to-new-backup-daemon`.

- To make the |application| highly available, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/configure-application-high-availability`.
