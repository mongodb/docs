Sharding is the process of storing data records across multiple
machines and is MongoDB's approach to meeting the demands of data
growth. As the size of the data increases, a single machine may not be
sufficient to store the data nor provide an acceptable read and write
throughput. Sharding solves the problem with horizontal scaling. With
sharding, you add more machines to support data growth and the demands
of read and write operations.
