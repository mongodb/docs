msgid "Because these operations drop *all* the indexes from a collection and then recreate them sequentially, the error from the |limit| prevents these operations from rebuilding any remaining indexes for the collection and, in the case of the :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` command, from continuing with the remainder of the process."
