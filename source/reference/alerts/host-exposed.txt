============
Host Exposed
============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Description
-----------

The MongoDB instance running on ``host X`` in ``rsY`` is exposed to the
public Internet.

Common Triggers
---------------

- The :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` process could be reached
  because it is not behind a firewall and does not have authentication
  enabled.

Possible Solutions
------------------

- Install and configure a firewall between the public Internet and your
  MongoDB instance.

- Enable authentication for the instance. You can choose from the following
  options:

  - :doc:`/tutorial/enable-mongodbcr-authentication-for-group`

  - :doc:`/tutorial/enable-ldap-authentication-for-group`

  - :doc:`/tutorial/enable-kerberos-authentication-for-group`
