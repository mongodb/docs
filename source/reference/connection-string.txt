Standard Connection String Format
---------------------------------

This section describes the standard format of the MongoDB connection URI
used to connect to a MongoDB database server. The format is the same for
all official MongoDB drivers. For a list of drivers and links to driver
documentation, see :doc:`/applications/drivers`.

The following is the standard URI connection scheme:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]

The components of this string are:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80

   * - ``mongodb://``

     - A required prefix to identify that this is a string in the
       standard connection format.

   * - ``username:password@``

     - Optional. If specified, the client will attempt to log in to the
       specific database using these credentials after connecting to
       the :program:`mongod` instance.

   * - ``host1``

     - Required. It identifies a server
       address to connect to. It identifies either a hostname, IP
       address, or UNIX domain socket. 
       
       .. include:: /includes/fact-uri-rs-hostnames.rst

       For a sharded cluster, specify the hostname of the
       :program:`mongos` instance.
       

   * - ``:port1``

     - Optional. The default value is ``:27017`` if not specified.

   * - ``hostN``

     - Optional. You can specify as many hosts as necessary. You would
       specify multiple hosts, for example, for connections to replica
       sets.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-uri-rs-hostnames.rst

       For a sharded cluster, specify the hostname of the
       :program:`mongos` instance.

   * - ``:portX``

     - Optional. The default value is ``:27017`` if not specified.

   * - ``/database``

     - Optional. The name of the database to authenticate if the
       connection string includes authentication credentials in the
       form of ``username:password@``. If ``/database`` is not
       specified and the connection string includes credentials, the
       driver will authenticate to the ``admin`` database.

   * - ``?options``

     - Connection specific options. See
       :ref:`connections-connection-options` for a full description of
       these options.

       If the connection string does not specify a database/ you must
       specify a slash (i.e. ``/``) between the last ``hostN`` and the
       question mark that begins the string of options.

.. example::

   To describe a connection to a replica set named ``test``, with the
   following :program:`mongod` hosts:

   - ``db1.example.net`` on port ``27017`` and
   - ``db2.example.net`` on port ``2500``.

   You would use a connection string that resembles the following:

   .. code-block:: none

      mongodb://db1.example.net:27017,db2.example.net:2500/?replicaSet=test


   .. include:: /includes/fact-uri-rs-hostnames.rst

.. example::

   To describe a connection to a sharded cluster with the
   following :program:`mongos` hosts:

   - ``r1.example.net`` on port ``27017`` and
   - ``r2.example.net`` on port ``27017``.

   You would use a connection string that resembles the following:

   .. code-block:: none

      mongodb://r1.example.net:27017,r2.example.net:27017/

.. index:: connections; dns-seedlist
.. _connections-dns-seedlist:
      
      
DNS Seedlist Connection Format
------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.6

In addition to the standard connection format, MongoDB supports a DNS-constructed
seedlist. Using DNS to construct the available servers list allows more flexibility
of deployment and the ability to change the servers in rotation without reconfiguring
clients.

In order to leverage the DNS seedlist, use a connection string prefix of ``mongodb+srv:`` 
in place of the ``mongodb:`` string above.

The ``+srv`` indicates to the mongo client that the hostname that follows corresponds to a 
DNS SRV record. The client driver will then query the DNS for the record to determine the hosts that
are running the mongod instances.

For example, to connect to a DNS-listed hostname:

.. code-block:: none
 
    mongodb+srv://server.example.com/
 
A typical DNS configuration for the connection string above might look something
like this:

.. code-block:: none

   Record                            TTL   Class    Priority Weight Port  Target
   _mongodb._tcp.server.example.com. 86400 IN SRV   0        5      27317 mongodb1.example.com.
   _mongodb._tcp.server.example.com. 86400 IN SRV   0        5      27017 mongodb2.example.com.

.. note::
  The hostnames returned in SRV records must share the same parent domain (in this example, ``example.com``)
  as the given hostname.
  
The DNS seedlist connection string can also provide options as a query string, with a trailing "/?" as in
the standard connection string above. However, the ``+srv`` appended to the standard connection string 
signals the driver to query the DNS for options as a configured TXT record. 

Only two options are available for configuration via a TXT record -- 
``replicaSet`` and ``authSource``, and only one TXT record
is allowed per server. If multiple TXT records appear in the DNS and/or if the TXT record contains
an option other than ``replicaSet`` or ``authSource``, an error will be thrown by the
driver.

An example of a properly configured TXT record:

.. code-block:: none

   Record              TTL   Class    Text
   server.example.com. 86400 IN TXT   "replicaSet=mySet&authSource=authDB"

In this case, taking into account both
the DNS SRV records and the options retrieved from the TXT records, the parsed string will look like:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://mongodb1.example.com:27317,mongodb2.example.com:27017/?replicaSet=mySet&authSource=authDB

Options set in a TXT record can be overridden by passing in a query string with the URI. In the example below,
the query string has provided an override for the ``authSource`` option configured in the TXT record of the DNS
entry above.

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb+srv://server.example.com/?connectTimeoutMS=300000&authSource=aDifferentAuthDB
       
The rest of the option string will remain, and we can expect that the resulting URI 
would look like this (after parse).

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://mongodb1.example.com:27317,mongodb2.example.com:27017/?connectTimeoutMS=300000&replicaSet=mySet&authSource=aDifferentAuthDB
       
.. note::
   The ``mongodb+srv`` option will fail if there is no available DNS with records that correspond to the
   hostname identified in the connection string. In addition, use of the ``+srv`` connection string modifier
   sets the ``ssl`` option to ``true`` automatically for the connection. This can be overridden by explicitly setting
   the ``ssl`` option to ``false`` with ``ssl=false`` in the query string.


.. index:: connections; options
.. _connections-connection-options:

Connection String Options
-------------------------

This section lists all connection options used in the
:ref:`connections-standard-connection-string-format`.

Connection options are pairs in the following form: ``name=value``. The
``value`` is always case sensitive. Separate options with the ampersand
(i.e. ``&``) character. In the following example, a connection uses the
``replicaSet`` and ``connectTimeoutMS`` options:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://db1.example.net:27017,db2.example.net:2500/?replicaSet=test&connectTimeoutMS=300000

.. admonition:: Semi-colon separator for connection string arguments

   To provide backwards compatibility, drivers currently accept
   semi-colons (i.e. ``;``) as option separators.

.. _replica-set-options:
.. _replica-set-option:

Replica Set Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: replicaSet

     - Specifies the name of the :term:`replica set`, if the
       :program:`mongod` is a member of a replica set.

       When connecting to a replica set it is important to give a seed
       list of at least two :program:`mongod` instances. If you only
       provide the connection point of a single :program:`mongod`
       instance, and omit the :urioption:`replicaSet`, the client will
       create a :term:`standalone` connection.

Connection Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: ssl

     - ``true``: Initiate the connection with TLS/SSL.

       ``false``: Initiate the connection without TLS/SSL.

       The default value is ``false``.

       .. note::
          The :urioption:`ssl` option is not supported by all drivers.
          See your :doc:`driver </applications/drivers>` documentation
          and the :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl` document.

   * - .. urioption:: connectTimeoutMS

     - The time in milliseconds to attempt a connection before timing
       out. The default is never to timeout, though different drivers
       might vary. See the :doc:`driver </applications/drivers>`
       documentation.

   * - .. urioption:: socketTimeoutMS

     - The time in milliseconds to attempt a send or receive on a
       socket before the attempt times out. The default is never to
       timeout, though different drivers might vary. See the
       :doc:`driver </applications/drivers>` documentation.

.. _connection-pool-options:

Connection Pool Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most drivers implement some kind of connection pool handling. 
Some drivers do not support connection
pools. See your :doc:`driver </applications/drivers>` documentation
for more information on the connection pooling implementation. These
options allow applications to configure the connection pool when
connecting to the MongoDB deployment.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: maxPoolSize

     - The maximum number of connections in the connection pool. The
       default value is ``100``.

   * - .. urioption:: minPoolSize

     - The minimum number of connections in the connection pool. The
       default value is ``0``.

       .. note::
          The :urioption:`minPoolSize` option is not supported by all
          drivers. For information on your driver, see the
          :doc:`drivers </applications/drivers>` documentation.

   * - .. urioption:: maxIdleTimeMS

     - The maximum number of milliseconds that a connection can remain
       idle in the pool before being removed and closed.

       This option is not supported by all drivers.

   * - .. urioption:: waitQueueMultiple

     - A number that the driver multiples the :urioption:`maxPoolSize`
       value to, to provide the maximum number of threads allowed to
       wait for a connection to become available from the pool. For
       default values, see the :doc:`/applications/drivers`
       documentation.

   * - .. urioption:: waitQueueTimeoutMS

     - The maximum time in milliseconds that a thread can wait for a
       connection to become available. For default values, see the
       :doc:`/applications/drivers` documentation.

.. _connections-write-concern:

Write Concern Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Write concern <write-concern>` describes the kind of assurances
that the :program:`mongod` and the driver provide to the application
regarding the success and durability of the write operation. For a
full explanation of write concern and write operations in general, see
:doc:`/reference/write-concern`.

.. note::

   You can specify the write concern both in the connection string and
   as a parameter to method calls like ``insert`` or ``update``. If the
   write concern is specified in both places, the method parameter
   overrides the connection-string setting.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: w

     - Corresponds to the write concern :ref:`wc-w`. The ``w`` option
       requests acknowledgement that the write operation has propagated
       to a specified number of :program:`mongod` instances or to
       :program:`mongod` instances with specified tags.

       You can specify a :writeconcern:`number <\<number\>>`, the
       string :writeconcern:`majority <"majority">`, or a
       :writeconcern:`tag set <\<tag set\>>`.

       For details, see :ref:`wc-w`.

   * - .. urioption:: wtimeoutMS

     - Corresponds to the write concern :ref:`wc-wtimeout`.
       :urioption:`wtimeoutMS` specifies a time limit, in milliseconds,
       for the write concern.

       When ``wtimeoutMS`` is ``0``, write operations will never time
       out. For more information, see :ref:`wc-wtimeout`.

   * - .. urioption:: journal

     - Corresponds to the write concern :ref:`wc-j` option. The
       :urioption:`journal` option requests acknowledgement from
       MongoDB that the write operation has been written to the
       :doc:`journal </core/journaling>`. For details, see :ref:`wc-j`.

       If you set :urioption:`journal` to ``true``, and specify a
       :urioption:`w` value less than 1, :urioption:`journal` prevails.

       .. versionchanged:: 2.6
          If you set :urioption:`journal` to true, and the
          :program:`mongod` does not have journaling enabled, as with
          :setting:`storage.journal.enabled`, then MongoDB will error.
          In previous versions, MongoDB would provide basic receipt
          acknowledgement (i.e. ``w:1``), ignore :urioption:`journal`,
          and include a ``jnote`` field in its return document.

``readConcern`` Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 3.2

   For the WiredTiger storage engine, MongoDB 3.2 introduces the
   readConcern option for replica sets and replica set shards.

:doc:`/reference/read-concern` allows clients to choose a level of
isolation for their reads from replica sets.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: readConcernLevel

     - The level of isolation. Can accept one of the following values:
     
       - :readconcern:`local <"local">`
       - :readconcern:`majority <"majority">`
       - :readconcern:`linearizable <"linearizable">`
       - :readconcern:`available <"available">`

       For details, see :doc:`/reference/read-concern`.

.. _connections-read-preference:

Read Preference Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`Read preferences </core/read-preference>` describe the
behavior of read operations with regards to :term:`replica sets
<replica set>`. These parameters allow you to specify read preferences
on a per-connection basis in the connection string:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: readPreference

     - Specifies the :term:`replica set` read preference for this
       connection. 
       
       The read preference values are the following:

       - :readmode:`primary`
       - :readmode:`primaryPreferred`
       - :readmode:`secondary`
       - :readmode:`secondaryPreferred`
       - :readmode:`nearest`

       For descriptions of each value, see
       :ref:`replica-set-read-preference-modes`.

       The default value is :readmode:`primary`, which sends all read
       operations to the replica set's :term:`primary`.

   * - .. urioption:: maxStalenessSeconds
   
     - .. versionadded:: 3.4
     
       Specifies, in seconds, how stale a secondary can be before the client
       stops using it for read operations. For details, see:
       :ref:`replica-set-read-preference-max-staleness`.

       By default, there is no maximum staleness and clients will not consider a
       secondary's lag when choosing where to direct a read operation.
  
       The minimum :urioption:`maxStalenessSeconds` value is 90
       seconds. Specifying a value between 0 and 90 seconds will produce
       an error. MongoDB drivers treat a ``maxStalenessSeconds`` value
       of ``-1`` as "no max staleness", the same as if
       ``maxStalenessSeconds`` is omitted.
       
       .. important::
          To use ``maxStalenessSeconds``, all of the
          MongoDB instances in your deployment must be using MongoDB 3.4 or
          later. If any instances are on an earlier version of MongoDB, the
          driver or :program:`mongos` will raise an error.
      
       The following specifies a maxStalenessSeconds value of 120 seconds
       with the :readmode:`secondary` read preference mode:
       
       .. code-block:: none
       
          mongodb://host.example.com/?readPreference=secondary&maxStalenessSeconds=120

   * - .. urioption:: readPreferenceTags

     - Specifies a tag set as a comma-separated list of colon-separated
       key-value pairs. For example:

       .. code-block:: none

          dc:ny,rack:1

       To specify a *list* of tag sets, use multiple
       ``readPreferenceTags``.

       The following specifies two tag sets and an empty tag set:

       .. code-block:: none

          readPreferenceTags=dc:ny,rack:1&readPreferenceTags=dc:ny&readPreferenceTags=

       Order matters when using multiple ``readPreferenceTags``.

Authentication Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: authSource

     - Specify the database name associated with the user's
       credentials. :urioption:`authSource`
       defaults to the database specified in the connection string.

       For authentication mechanisms that delegate credential storage
       to other services, the :urioption:`authSource` value should be
       ``$external`` as with the ``PLAIN`` (LDAP) and ``GSSAPI``
       (Kerberos) authentication mechanisms.

       MongoDB will ignore :urioption:`authSource` values if the
       connection string specifies no username.

   * - .. urioption:: authMechanism

     - .. versionchanged:: 2.6
          Added support for the ``PLAIN`` and ``MONGODB-X509``
          authentication mechanisms.

       .. versionchanged:: 3.0
          Added support for the ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` authentication mechanism.

          Specify the authentication mechanism that MongoDB will use to
          authenticate the connection. Possible values include:

       - :ref:`SCRAM-SHA-1 <authentication-scram-sha-1>`
       - :ref:`MONGODB-CR <authentication-mongodb-cr>`
       - :ref:`MONGODB-X509 <security-auth-x509>`
       - :ref:`GSSAPI <security-auth-kerberos>` (Kerberos)
       - :ref:`PLAIN <security-auth-ldap>` (LDAP SASL)

       Only MongoDB Enterprise :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`
       instances provide ``GSSAPI`` (Kerberos) and ``PLAIN`` (LDAP)
       mechanisms. To use ``MONGODB-X509``, you must have TLS/SSL
       Enabled.

       See :doc:`/core/authentication` for more information about the
       authentication system in MongoDB. Also consider
       :doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication` for more
       information on x509 authentication.

   * - .. urioption:: gssapiServiceName

     - Set the Kerberos service name when connecting to Kerberized
       MongoDB instances. This value must match the service name set on
       MongoDB instances.

       :urioption:`gssapiServiceName` defaults to ``mongodb`` for all
       clients and for MongoDB instance. If you change
       :parameter:`saslServiceName` setting on a MongoDB instance, you
       will need to set :urioption:`gssapiServiceName` to the same
       value.

.. _selection-discovery-options:

Server Selection and Discovery Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides the following options to configure how MongoDB drivers
and :program:`mongos` instances select a server to which to direct read
or write operations.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70
   
   * - Connection Option
     - Description
   
   * - .. urioption:: localThresholdMS

     - The size (in milliseconds) of the latency window for selecting
       among multiple suitable MongoDB instances. *Default*: 15
       milliseconds.
       
       All drivers use :urioption:`localThresholdMS`. Use the
       ``localThreshold`` alias when specifying the latency window size
       to :program:`mongos`.

   * - .. urioption:: serverSelectionTimeoutMS

     - Specifies how long (in milliseconds) to block for server
       selection before throwing an exception. *Default*: 30,000
       milliseconds.

   * - .. urioption:: serverSelectionTryOnce

     - **Single-threaded drivers only**. When ``true``, instructs the
       driver to scan the MongoDB deployment exactly once after server
       selection fails and then either select a server or raise an
       error. When ``false``, the driver blocks and searches for a
       server up to the :urioption:`serverSelectionTimeoutMS` value.
       *Default*: ``true``.
       
       Multi-threaded drivers and :program:`mongos` do not support
       :urioption:`serverSelectionTryOnce`.

   * - .. urioption:: heartbeatFrequencyMS

     - :urioption:`heartbeatFrequencyMS` controls when the driver
       checks the state of the MongoDB deployment. Specify the interval
       (in milliseconds) between checks, counted from the end of the
       previous check until the beginning of the next one.
       
       *Default*:
       
       - Single-threaded drivers: 60 seconds.
       - Multi-threaded drivers: 10 seconds.
       
       :program:`mongos` does not support changing the frequency of 
       the heartbeat checks.

Miscellaneous Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option

     - Enable :ref:`retryable writes <retryable-writes>`.

       Possible values are:

       - ``true``

       - ``false``. The default value for the 3.6 drivers is ``false``.

       .. versionadded:: 3.6

   * - .. urioption:: uuidRepresentation

     - Possible values are:

       ``standard``
         The standard binary representation.

       ``csharpLegacy``
         The default representation for the C# driver.

       ``javaLegacy``
         The default representation for the Java driver.

       ``pythonLegacy``
         The default representation for the Python driver.

       For the default, see the :doc:`drivers </applications/drivers>`
       documentation for your driver.

       .. note::
          Not all drivers support the :urioption:`uuidRepresentation`
          option. For information on your driver, see the :doc:`drivers
          </applications/drivers>` documentation.
