.. admonition:: Upgrade Mode for Highly Available |application|\s
   :class: note

   If you have an |onprem| 4.4 installation with more than one |onprem|
   host pointing to the same Application Database, this |onprem|
   deployment runs with high availability. After you upgrade one
   |onprem| host of a highly available |onprem| deployment, that
   deployment enters **Upgrade Mode**.
