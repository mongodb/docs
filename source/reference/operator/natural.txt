.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. operator:: $natural

  Use the :operator:`$natural` operator to use :term:`natural order` for
  the results of a sort operation. Natural order refers to the
  order of documents in the file on disk.

  The :operator:`$natural` operator uses the following syntax to return
  documents in the order they exist on disk:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.collection.find().sort( { $natural: 1 } )

  Use ``-1`` to return documents in the reverse order as they occur on
  disk:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.collection.find().sort( { $natural: -1 } )

  .. seealso:: :method:`cursor.sort()`
