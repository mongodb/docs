|service| provides details to connect a :program:`mongo` shell to a
cluster.

Prerequisites
-------------

- TLS/SSL
   Clients must have support for TLS/SSL to connect to an |service|
   cluster.

   .. note::

      If using the :program:`mongo` shell, you must use **version 3.2.6
      or later** binary with TLS/SSL support. To download the binary,
      see `Download Center <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center>`_
      and download the Server package with TLS/SSL support; the Server
      package includes the :program:`mongo` shell.

      For OS X, you cannot use the 3.2.6 :program:`mongo` shell
      installed via homebrew to connect to |service|. As such, for OS
      X, do not use homebrew to install the version 3.2.6 package for
      use with |service|; instead, download the ``*.tgz`` or ``*.zip``
      file.

- Whitelist
   To access a cluster you must connect from an IP address on the
   cluster's whitelist. If you have not done so, :ref:`add your IP
   address to the whitelist <add-to-whitelist>`. You can also add an IP
   address to the whitelist when retrieving connection information.
