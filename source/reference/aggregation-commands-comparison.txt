Aggregation Commands Comparison Table
-------------------------------------

The following table provides a brief overview of the features of the
MongoDB aggregation commands.

   * -  

     - :dbcommand:`aggregate` / :method:`db.collection.aggregate()`

     - :dbcommand:`mapReduce` / :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()`

   * - Description

     - 
       Designed with specific goals of improving performance and
       usability for aggregation tasks.
       
       Uses a "pipeline" approach where objects are transformed as they
       pass through a series of pipeline stages such as
       :pipeline:`$group`, :pipeline:`$match`, and :pipeline:`$sort`.
       
       For more information on pipeline stages, see
       :ref:`aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference`.
       

     - Implements the Map-Reduce aggregation for processing large data sets.
       

   * - Key Features

     - Pipeline operators can be repeated as needed.
       
       Pipeline operators need not produce one output document for every
       input document.
       
       Can also generate new documents or filter out documents.

       Using the :pipeline:`$merge` stage, you can create on-demand materialized 
       views, where the content of the output collection can be updated 
       incrementally the pipeline is run. :pipeline:`$merge` can incorporate 
       results (insert new documents, merge documents, replace documents, keep 
       existing documents, fail the operation, process documents with a custom
       update pipeline) into an existing collection.

     - In addition to grouping operations, can perform complex
       aggregation tasks as well as perform incremental aggregation on
       continuously growing datasets.
       
       See :doc:`/tutorial/map-reduce-examples/` and
       :doc:`/tutorial/perform-incremental-map-reduce/`.
       

   * - Flexibility

     - You can define custom accumulators with :group:`$accumulator` 
       and custom expressions with :expression:`$function`.
    
       You can also use the :pipeline:`$project` pipeline stage to add
       computed fields and reshape existing document fields.
       
       See :pipeline:`$project` for more information as well as
       :ref:`aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference` for more
       information on all the available pipeline stages.
       

     - Custom ``map``, ``reduce`` and ``finalize`` JavaScript
       functions offer flexibility to aggregation logic.
       
       See :dbcommand:`mapReduce` for details and restrictions
       on the functions.
       

   * - Output Results

     - Returns results as a cursor. If the pipeline includes the
       :pipeline:`$out` stage or :pipeline:`$merge` stage, the cursor
       is empty.
       
       With :pipeline:`$out`, you can replace an existing output
       collection completely or output to a new collection. See
       :pipeline:`$out` for details.

       With :pipeline:`$merge`, you can output to a new or existing
       collection. For existing cllections, you can specify how to
       incorporate the results into the output collection (insert new
       documents, merge documents, replace documents, keep existing
       documents, fail the operation, process documents with a custom
       update pipeline). See :pipeline:`$merge` for details.
 
     - Returns results in various options (inline, new collection, merge,
       replace, reduce). See :dbcommand:`mapReduce` for details on the
       output options.
       

   * - Sharding

     - Supports non-sharded and sharded input collections.
     
       :pipeline:`$merge` can output to a non-sharded or sharded
       collection.

     - Supports non-sharded and sharded input collections.
