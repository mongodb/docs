Working with Multiple Environments
----------------------------------

If you have multiple MongoDB systems in distinct environments and
cannot monitor all systems with a single agent, you will need to add a
new group. Having a second group makes it possible to run two agents,
because the API and secret keys are unique to the group.

You may also use a second group and agent to monitor a different set
of MongoDB instances in the same environment if you want to segregate
the hosts within the MMS console. A user can only view data from the
hosts monitored in a single group at once.

After adding a second group, the MMS interface will have a drop down list
that will allow you to change groups. Selecting a new group will
refresh the current page with the data available from the servers in
this group.

Create Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a new group click on the "Users" page, and click on the "Add
New Group" link on the upper left hand side of the page. Then,
specify the new group name and select the ``+ Add New Group`` button 
to create the new group. Group names must be unique and you cannot reuse
a group name. After creating a
group, only the current user account is a member that group.
To add more people, click on the "Users" page in your new group.

Rename Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to change the name of a group, click on the edit group name
button (with the pencil icon) near your group name at the top of the
"Users" page of the MMS console. 
Group names must be unique and you cannot reuse a
group name.

Remove Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can remove users from a group at any time from the "Users" page.

Although it's not possible to delete a group, you can *remove* a group
by removing all users from the group, and then remove your own account
from the group. The group will then be orphaned. It will remain
for auditing purposes, but be otherwise inaccessible.
