   - Q: Are people allowed to decrease in scale? can we go from a
     sharded cluster to a replica set?

   - Q: Can we decrease # of members in a replica set?

.. note::
   include pros/cons of vertical and horizontal scaling.
   
Vertical Scale
--------------

Blah blah blah -- you can scale up/down(?) the storage...


Horizontal Scale
----------------

Blah blah blah -- you can:

- convert replica set to a sharded cluster

- add more shards.

.. note::
   Q: What happens if you shard incorrectly?  Bad shard key.
