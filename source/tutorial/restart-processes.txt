You can restart a running :manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`, :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`,
or :term:`standalone` process directly from the |mms| console. Instead of restarting
an entire deployment, you can also restart individual |mms|-managed 
MongoDB member processes of a deployment.

.. note::

   If |mms| Automation manages a |mongos| process and that process
   remains unreachable for 30 days, |mms| removes that process from the
   :guilabel:`Deployment` tab view. If you restart the |mongos|
   process, |mms| detects it again. To learn more, see the
   host is down (``HOST_DOWN``) alert.
