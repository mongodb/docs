Overview
--------

Enforcing access control on a :term:`sharded cluster` requires configuring:

- Security between components of the cluster using
  :ref:`Internal Authentication<replica-set-security>`.

- Security between connecting clients and the cluster using
  :ref:`User Access Controls<authorization>`.

For this tutorial, each member of the sharded cluster *must* use the same
internal authentication mechanism and settings. This means enforcing internal
authentication on each :binary:`~bin.mongos` and :binary:`~bin.mongod` in the cluster.

The following tutorial uses a :ref:`keyfile <internal-auth-keyfile>` to
enable internal authentication.

Enforcing internal authentication also enforces user access control. To
connect to the replica set, clients like :binary:`~bin.mongosh` need to
use a :ref:`user account<authorization>`. See
:ref:`security-shardClust-deploy-access-control`.

CloudManager and OpsManager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using Cloud Manager or Ops Manager to manage your deployment,
see the respective :mms-docs:`Cloud Manager manual
</tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials>`
or the :opsmgr:`Ops Manager manual
</tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials>` to enforce authentication.

IP Binding
~~~~~~~~~~~

Keyfile Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keyfiles are bare-minimum forms of security and are best suited for testing or
development environments. For production environments we recommend using
:ref:`X.509 certificates<security-auth-x509>`.

Access Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users
~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/sharded-clusters-users.rst

This tutorial requires creating sharded cluster users, but includes
optional steps for adding shard-local users.

See the :doc:`/core/security-users` security documentation for more
information.

Operating System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial uses the :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
programs. Windows users should use the :binary:`mongod.exe` and
:binary:`mongos.exe` programs instead.

Deploy Sharded Cluster with Keyfile Access Control
--------------------------------------------------

The following procedures involve creating a new sharded cluster that consists
of a :binary:`~bin.mongos`, the config servers, and two shards.

.. include:: /includes/important-hostnames.rst

Create the Keyfile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/keyfile-intro-sharded-cluster.rst

.. code-block:: bash

   openssl rand -base64 756 > <path-to-keyfile>
   chmod 400 <path-to-keyfile>

See :ref:`internal-auth-keyfile` for additional details  and requirements
for using keyfiles.

Distribute the Keyfile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/keyfile-distribution-sharded-cluster.rst

.. _deploy-auth-cluster-create-config-server-replica-set:

Create the Config Server Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps deploys a config server replica set.

For a production deployment, deploys a config server replica set with at
least three members. For testing purposes, you can create a
single-member replica set.

.. include:: /includes/steps/deploy-sharded-cluster-config-server.rst

Once the config server replica set (CSRS) is initiated and up, proceed
to creating the shard replica sets.

Create the Shard Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a production deployment, use a replica set with at least three
members. For testing purposes, you can create a single-member replica
set.

These steps include optional procedures for adding shard-local users.
Executing them now ensures that there are users available for each
shard to perform shard-level maintenance.

.. include:: /includes/steps/deploy-sharded-cluster-shard-replica.rst

Connect a ``mongos`` to the Sharded Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/deploy-sharded-cluster-connect.rst

Add Shards to the Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To proceed, you must be connected to the :binary:`~bin.mongos` and
authenticated as the cluster administrator user for the sharded cluster.

.. note::

   This is the cluster administrator for the sharded cluster and *not*
   the shard-local cluster administrator.

To add each shard to the cluster, use the :method:`sh.addShard()`
method. If the shard is a replica set, specify the name of the replica
set and specify a member of the set. In production deployments, *all*
shards should be replica sets.

The following operation adds a single shard replica set to the cluster:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.addShard( "<replSetName>/s1-mongo1.example.net:27017")

The following operation is an example of adding a standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod`
shard to the cluster:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.addShard( "s1-mongo1.example.net:27017")

Repeat these steps until the cluster includes all shards. At this
point, the sharded cluster enforces access control for the cluster as
well as for internal communications between each sharded cluster
component.


Shard a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To proceed, you must be connected to the :binary:`~bin.mongos` and
authenticated as the cluster administrator user for the sharded cluster.

.. note::

   This is the cluster administrator for the sharded cluster and *not*
   the shard-local cluster administrator.

To shard a collection, use the :method:`sh.shardCollection()` method.
You must specify the full namespace of the collection and a document containing
the shard key.

Your selection of shard key affects the efficiency of sharding, as well as
your ability to take advantage of certain sharding features such as
:ref:`zones <zone-sharding>`. See the selection considerations listed
in the :ref:`sharding-shard-key-selection`.

If the collection already contains data, you must create an index on the
:term:`shard key` using the :method:`db.collection.createIndex()` method before
using :method:`~sh.shardCollection()`.

If the collection is empty, MongoDB creates the index as part of
:method:`sh.shardCollection()`.

The following is an example of the :method:`sh.shardCollection()` method:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.shardCollection("<database>.<collection>", { <key> : <direction> } )

Next Steps
----------

Create users to allow clients to connect to and interact with
the sharded cluster.

See :ref:`database-user-roles` for basic built-in roles to use in creating
read-only and read-write users.

X.509 Internal Authentication
-----------------------------

For details on using X.509 for internal authentication, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-member-authentication`.

To upgrade from keyfile internal authentication to X.509 internal
authentication, see
:doc:`/tutorial/upgrade-keyfile-to-x509`.
