Atlas Data Federation supports various data store providers as federated database
instance stores. You must define mappings in your federated database instance 
to a data stores to run queries against your data.

.. important::

    Information in your storage configuration is visible internally at MongoDB and 
    stored as operational data to monitor and improve the performance of Atlas 
    Data Federation. So, we recommend that you do not use PII in your configurations.

Select your preferred provider from the dropdown menu to learn how to configure 
your data store with that provider:
