What You'll Need
----------------

.. include:: /includes/prereqs_read_CRUD.rst

Procedure
---------

.. tabs-selector:: drivers

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Connect to your MongoDB instance.

      .. include:: /includes/drivers_connect.rst

   .. step:: Get the database and collection.

      Switch to the database and collection you wish to query. In
      this case we will be using the ``sample_guides`` database and
      ``comets`` collection. 

      .. include:: /includes/bind_db_comets.rst

   .. step:: Insert Documents
   
      MongoDB stores documents as ``BSON``, a binary form of JavaScript 
      Object Notation ``JSON``. The database stores documents in 
      collections.

      The following example inserts three new documents into the
      ``comets`` collection. Each document consists of the following
      information about the comet:

      - The name
      - The official name
      - The orbital period in years
      - The radius in miles
      - The mass in kilograms

      .. include:: /includes/driver-example-insert-1.rst

      .. tip:: 
         
         If your document does not specify the ``_id`` field, the driver 
         automatically generates a unique ``ObjectId`` value for the 
         ``_id`` field.
      
      MongoDB collections have **dynamic schemas**. A single collection
      can store documents that differ in shapes (i.e. contain different
      fields and value types). 

      .. note::
    
         While MongoDB does support dynamic collection definitions, you 
         can also enforce a uniform schema for the documents in your 
         collection.

.. See :ref:`JSON Schema validation <schema-validation-json>`.
