Synopsis
--------

This document provides a pattern for doing multi-document updates or
"transactions" using a two-phase commit approach for writing data to
multiple documents. Additionally, you can extend this process to
provide a :ref:`rollback <2-phase-commits-rollback>` like
functionality.

Background
----------

Operations on a single :term:`document` are always atomic with MongoDB
databases; however, operations that involve multiple documents, which
are often referred to as "transactions," are not atomic. Since
documents can be fairly complex and contain multiple "nested"
documents, single-document atomicity provides necessary support for
many practical use cases.

Thus, without precautions, success or failure of the database
operation cannot be "all or nothing," and without support for
multi-document transactions it's possible for an operation to succeed
for some operations and fail with others. When executing a transaction
composed of several sequential operations the following issues arise:

- Atomicity: if one operation fails, the previous operation within the
  transaction must "rollback" to the previous state (i.e. the
  "nothing," in "all or nothing.")

- Isolation: operations that run concurrently with the transaction
  operation set must "see" a consistent view of the data throughout
  the transaction process.

- Consistency: if a major failure (i.e. network, hardware) interrupts
  the transaction, the database must be able to recover a consistent
  state.

Despite the power of single-document atomic operations, there are
cases that require multi-document transactions. For these situations,
you can use a two-phase commit, to provide support for these kinds of
multi-document updates.

Because documents can represent both pending data and states, you can
use a two-phase commit to ensure that data is consistent, and that in
the case of an error, the state that preceded the transaction is
:ref:`recoverable <2-phase-commits-rollback>`.

.. note::

   Because only single-document operations are atomic with MongoDB,
   two-phase commits can only offer transaction-*like* semantics. It's
   possible for applications to return intermediate data at
   intermediate points during the two-phase commit or rollback.

Pattern
-------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

The most common example of transaction is to transfer funds from
account A to B in a reliable way, and this pattern uses this operation
as an example. In a relational database system, this operation would
encapsulate subtracting funds from the source (``A``) account and
adding them to the destination (``B``) within a single atomic
transaction. For MongoDB, you can use a two-phase commit in these
situations to achieve a compatible response.

All of the examples in this document use the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to
interact with the database, and assume that you have two collections:
First, a collection named ``accounts`` that will store data about
accounts with one account per document, and a collection named
``transactions`` which will store the transactions themselves.

Begin by creating two accounts named ``A`` and ``B``, with the
following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.accounts.save({name: "A", balance: 1000, pendingTransactions: []})
   db.accounts.save({name: "B", balance: 1000, pendingTransactions: []})

To verify that these operations succeeded, use :method:`find()
<db.collection.find()>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.accounts.find()

:binary:`~bin.mongo` will return two :term:`documents <document>` that
resemble the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : ObjectId("4d7bc66cb8a04f512696151f"), "name" : "A", "balance" : 1000, "pendingTransactions" : [ ] }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("4d7bc67bb8a04f5126961520"), "name" : "B", "balance" : 1000, "pendingTransactions" : [ ] }

Transaction Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _2-phase-commits-step-1:

Set Transaction State to Initial
````````````````````````````````

Create the ``transaction`` collection by inserting the following
document. The transaction document holds the ``source`` and
``destination``, which refer to the ``name`` fields of the
``accounts`` collection, as well as the ``value`` field that
represents the amount of data change to the ``balance``
field. Finally, the ``state`` field reflects the current state of the
transaction.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.transactions.save({source: "A", destination: "B", value: 100, state: "initial"})

To verify that these operations succeeded, use :method:`find()
<db.collection.find()>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.transactions.find()

This will return a document similar to the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : ObjectId("4d7bc7a8b8a04f5126961522"), "source" : "A", "destination" : "B", "value" : 100, "state" : "initial" }

.. _2-phase-commits-step-2:

Switch Transaction State to Pending
```````````````````````````````````

Before modifying either records in the ``accounts`` collection, set
the transaction state to ``pending`` from ``initial``.

Set the local variable ``t`` in your shell session, to the transaction
document using :method:`findOne() <db.collection.findOne()>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   t = db.transactions.findOne({state: "initial"})

After assigning this variable ``t``, the shell will return the value
of ``t``, you will see the following output:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
        "_id" : ObjectId("4d7bc7a8b8a04f5126961522"),
        "source" : "A",
        "destination" : "B",
        "value" : 100,
        "state" : "initial"
   }

Use :method:`update() <db.collection.update()>` to change the value of
``state`` to ``pending``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.transactions.update({_id: t._id}, {$set: {state: "pending"}})
   db.transactions.find()

The :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` operation will return the
contents of the ``transactions`` collection, which should resemble the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : ObjectId("4d7bc7a8b8a04f5126961522"), "source" : "A", "destination" : "B", "value" : 100, "state" : "pending" }

.. _2-phase-commits-step-3:

Apply Transaction to Both Accounts
``````````````````````````````````

Continue by applying the transaction to both accounts. The
:method:`update() <db.collection.update()>` query will prevent you from
applying the transaction *if* the transaction is *not* already
pending. Use the following :method:`update() <db.collection.update()>`
operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.accounts.update({name: t.source, pendingTransactions: {$ne: t._id}}, {$inc: {balance: -t.value}, $push: {pendingTransactions: t._id}})
   db.accounts.update({name: t.destination, pendingTransactions: {$ne: t._id}}, {$inc: {balance: t.value}, $push: {pendingTransactions: t._id}})
   db.accounts.find()

The :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` operation will return the
contents of the ``accounts`` collection, which should now resemble the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : ObjectId("4d7bc97fb8a04f5126961523"), "balance" : 900, "name" : "A", "pendingTransactions" : [ ObjectId("4d7bc7a8b8a04f5126961522") ] }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("4d7bc984b8a04f5126961524"), "balance" : 1100, "name" : "B", "pendingTransactions" : [ ObjectId("4d7bc7a8b8a04f5126961522") ] }

.. _2-phase-commits-step-4:

Set Transaction State to Committed
``````````````````````````````````

Use the following :method:`update() <db.collection.update()>` operation
to set the transaction's state to ``committed``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.transactions.update({_id: t._id}, {$set: {state: "committed"}})
   db.transactions.find()

The :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` operation will return the
contents of the ``transactions`` collection, which should now resemble
the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : ObjectId("4d7bc7a8b8a04f5126961522"), "destination" : "B", "source" : "A", "state" : "committed", "value" : 100 }

.. _2-phase-commits-step-5:

Remove Pending Transaction
``````````````````````````

Use the following :method:`update() <db.collection.update()>` operation
to set remove the pending transaction from the :term:`documents
<document>` in the ``accounts`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.accounts.update({name: t.source}, {$pull: {pendingTransactions: t._id}})
   db.accounts.update({name: t.destination}, {$pull: {pendingTransactions: t._id}})
   db.accounts.find()

The :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` operation will return the
contents of the ``accounts`` collection, which should now resemble
the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : ObjectId("4d7bc97fb8a04f5126961523"), "balance" : 900, "name" : "A", "pendingTransactions" : [ ] }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("4d7bc984b8a04f5126961524"), "balance" : 1100, "name" : "B", "pendingTransactions" : [ ] }

.. _2-phase-commits-step-6:

Set Transaction State to Done
`````````````````````````````

Complete the transaction by setting the ``state`` of the transaction
:term:`document` to ``done``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.transactions.update({_id: t._id}, {$set: {state: "done"}})
   db.transactions.find()

The :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` operation will return the
contents of the ``transactions`` collection, which should now resemble
the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : ObjectId("4d7bc7a8b8a04f5126961522"), "destination" : "B", "source" : "A", "state" : "done", "value" : 100 }

.. _2-phase-commits-recovery:

Recovering from Failure Scenarios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most important part of the transaction procedure is not, the
prototypical example above, but rather the possibility for recovering
from the various failure scenarios when transactions do not complete
as intended. This section will provide an overview of possible
failures and provide methods to recover from these kinds of events.

There are two classes of failures:

- all failures that occur after the first step (i.e. ":ref:`setting
  the transaction set to initial <2-phase-commits-step-1>`") but
  before the third step (i.e. ":ref:`applying the transaction to both
  accounts <2-phase-commits-step-3>`.")

  To recover, applications should get a list of transactions in the
  ``pending`` state and resume from the second step
  (i.e. ":ref:`switching the transaction state to pending
  <2-phase-commits-step-2>`.")

- all failures that occur after the third step (i.e. ":ref:`applying
  the transaction to both accounts <2-phase-commits-step-3>`") but
  before the fifth step (i.e. ":ref:`setting the transaction state to
  done <2-phase-commits-step-5>`.")

  To recover, application should get a list of transactions in the
  ``committed`` state and resume from the fourth step
  (i.e. ":ref:`remove the pending transaction
  <2-phase-commits-step-5>`.")

Thus, the application will always be able to resume the transaction
and eventually arrive at a consistent state. Run the following
recovery operations every time the application starts to catch any
unfinished transactions. You may also wish run the recovery operation
at regular intervals to ensure that your data remains consistent.

The time required to reach a consistent state depends, on how long the
application needs to recover each transaction.

.. _2-phase-commits-rollback:

Rollback
````````

In some cases you may need to "rollback" or undo a transaction when
the application needs to "cancel" the transaction, or because it can
never recover as in cases where one of the accounts doesn't exist, or
stops existing during the transaction.

There are two possible rollback operations:

#. After you :ref:`apply the transaction <2-phase-commits-step-3>`
   (i.e. the third step,) you have fully committed the transaction and
   you should not roll back the transaction. Instead, create a new
   transaction and switch the values in the source and destination
   fields.

#. After you :ref:`create the transaction <2-phase-commits-step-1>`
   (i.e. the first step,) but before you :ref:`apply the transaction
   <2-phase-commits-step-3>` (i.e the third step,) use the following
   process:

.. _2-phase-commits-rollback-step-1:

Set Transaction State to Canceling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Begin by setting the transaction's state to ``canceling`` using the
following :method:`update() <db.collection.update()>` operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.transactions.update({_id: t._id}, {$set: {state: "canceling"}})

.. _2-phase-commits-rollback-step-2:

Undo the Transaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the following sequence of operations to undo the transaction
operation from both accounts:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.accounts.update({name: t.source, pendingTransactions: t._id}, {$inc: {balance: t.value}, $pull: {pendingTransactions: t._id}})
   db.accounts.update({name: t.destination, pendingTransactions: t._id}, {$inc: {balance: -t.value}, $pull: {pendingTransactions: t._id}})
   db.accounts.find()

The :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` operation will return the
contents of the ``accounts`` collection, which should resemble the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : ObjectId("4d7bc97fb8a04f5126961523"), "balance" : 1000, "name" : "A", "pendingTransactions" : [ ] }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("4d7bc984b8a04f5126961524"), "balance" : 1000, "name" : "B", "pendingTransactions" : [ ] }

.. _2-phase-commits-rollback-step-3:

Set Transaction State to Canceled
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Finally, use the following :method:`update()
<db.collection.update()>` operation to set the transaction's state to
``canceled``:

**Step 3:** set the transaction's state to "canceled":

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.transactions.update({_id: t._id}, {$set: {state: "canceled"}})

.. _2-phase-commits-concurrency:

Multiple Applications
`````````````````````

Transactions exist, in part, so that several applications can create
and run operations concurrently without causing data inconsistency or
conflicts. As a result, it is crucial that only one 1 application can
handle a given transaction at any point in time.

Consider the following example, with a single transaction
(i.e. ``T1``) and two applications (i.e. ``A1`` and ``A2``). If both
applications begin processing the transaction which is still in the
``initial`` state (i.e. :ref:`step 1 <2-phase-commits-step-1>`), then:

- ``A1`` can apply the entire whole transaction before ``A2`` starts.

- ``A2`` will then apply ``T1`` for the second time, because the
  transaction does not appear as pending in the ``accounts``
  documents.

To handle multiple applications, create a marker in the transaction
document itself to identify the application that is handling the
transaction. Use :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify()`
method to modify the transaction:

.. code-block:: javascript

   t = db.transactions.findAndModify({query: {state: "initial", application: {$exists: 0}},
                                      update: {$set: {state: "pending", application: "A1"}},
                                      new: true})

When you modify and reassign the local shell variable ``t``, the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell will return the ``t`` object, which should
resemble the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
        "_id" : ObjectId("4d7be8af2c10315c0847fc85"),
        "application" : "A1",
        "destination" : "B",
        "source" : "A",
        "state" : "pending",
        "value" : 150
   }

Amend the transaction operations to ensure that only applications
that match the identifier in the value of the ``application`` field
before applying the transaction.

If the application ``A1`` fails during transaction execution, you can
use the :ref:`recovery procedures <2-phase-commits-recovery>`, but
applications should ensure that they "owns" the transaction before
applying the transaction. For example to resume pending jobs, use a
query that resembles the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.transactions.find({application: "A1", state: "pending"})

This will (or may) return a document from the ``transactions``
document that resembles the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : ObjectId("4d7be8af2c10315c0847fc85"), "application" : "A1", "destination" : "B", "source" : "A", "state" : "pending", "value" : 150 }

.. _2-phase-commits-in-production:

Using Two-Phase Commits in Production Applications
--------------------------------------------------

The example transaction above is intentionally simple. For example, it
assumes that:

- it is always possible roll back operations an account.

- account balances can hold negative values.

Production implementations would likely be more complex. Typically
accounts need to information about current balance, pending credits,
pending debits. Then:

- when your application :ref:`switches the transaction state to
  pending <2-phase-commits-step-2>` (i.e. step 2) it would also make
  sure that the accounts has sufficient funds for the
  transaction. During this update operation, the application would
  also modify the values of the credits and debits as well as adding
  the transaction as pending.

- when your application :ref:`removes the pending transaction
  <2-phase-commits-step-4>` (i.e. step 4) the application would apply
  the transaction on balance, modify the credits and debits as well as
  removing the transaction from the ``pending`` field., all in one update.

Because all of the changes in the above two operations occur within a
single :method:`update() <db.collection.update()>` operation, these
changes are all atomic.

Additionally, for most important transactions, ensure that:

- the database interface (i.e. client library or :term:`driver`) has a
  reasonable :term:`write concern` configured to ensure that
  operations return a response on the success or failure of a write
  operation.

- your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance has :term:`journaling <journal>`
  enabled to ensure that your data is always in a recoverable state,
  in the event of an unclean :binary:`~bin.mongod` shutdown.
