You can specify a list of allowed cloud service
providers and instance sizes for |service| clusters deployed with the
{+osb+}. This whitelist can help control costs or ensure compliance by
limiting |service| clusters to certain cloud providers and sizes. When
you apply a whitelist and then :doc:`deploy a cluster </deploy>`, only
the providers and instance sizes listed in the whitelist appear in the
|k8s-service-catalog| marketplace.


Prerequisites
-------------

You must have the {+osb+} :doc:`installed </installation>`.

Considerations
--------------

Whitelist Scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The whitelist applies only to |service| clusters created through the
{+osb+}. |service| clusters created in the same project through the UI
are not limited by the whitelist.

Existing Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create and apply a whitelist at any time. If you have existing
|service| clusters in your project, make sure that their cloud service
providers and instance sizes are included in the whitelist to prevent
possible issues with the {+osb+}.
