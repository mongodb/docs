  To run ``mongocli`` commands from anywhere in your system, you must
  either:
    
  1. Add the location of the executable to your ``PATH`` or
  #. Move the executable to a directory in your ``PATH``.

  You can accomplish this in several ways, depending on your personal
  settings and environment. Consult the documentation for your shell and
  operating system for more examples.

  .. example::

     In the following example, the user downloads and installs 
     the {+mcli+} by cloning the GitHub repository. The ``mongocli``
     executable file saves to the location specified by your
     :github:`$GOPATH environment variable </golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH>`.
     The default location is ``$HOME/go`` on Unix systems and
     ``%USERPROFILE%\go`` on Windows.

     The user then adds this directory to their ``PATH``:

     .. code-block:: sh
        
        export PATH="$HOME/go:$PATH"

  .. example::

     In the following example, the user downloads and extracts a
     binary for the {+mcli+} to the ``/mcli_{+mcli-version+}-macOS_x86_64``
     directory. 

     The user then moves the executable file to a directory already in
     their ``PATH``: 

     .. code-block:: sh

        cd mcli_{+mcli-version+}-macOS_x86_64
        mv mongocli /usr/local/bin

  To verify your ``mongocli`` installation, run the ``help`` command:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongocli help

  The command returns the available commands and options for the
  {+mcli+}.
