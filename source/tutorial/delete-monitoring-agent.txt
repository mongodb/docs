|mms| displays active Monitoring Agents on the :guilabel:`Agents` page in
:guilabel:`Settings`. The page displays agents that have been active
in the last 24 hours. If an agent fails to report to |mms| for more than 24
hours, |mms| removes the agent from the :guilabel:`Agents` page.

Remove from |mms|
-----------------

To remove a Monitoring Agent from |mms|, :ref:`stop the agent
<stop-monitoring-agent>` and then wait 24 hours.

Delete from the Server
----------------------

To delete the Monitoring Agent **from a Linux or OSX server**, :ref:`stop the
agent <stop-monitoring-agent>` and then remove the
``mongodb-mms-monitoring-agent`` file from the ``/usr/bin`` directory. If you
installed the agent using a ``tar.gz`` file, the agent will be in the 
directory you chose during installation.

To delete the Monitoring Agent **from a Windows server**, :ref:`stop the agent
<stop-monitoring-agent-windows>` and then use the Windows program uninstaller
to remove the ``MongoDB Monitoring Agent`` program.
