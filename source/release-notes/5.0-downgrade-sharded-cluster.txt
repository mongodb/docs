Downgrade Path
--------------

.. include:: /includes/downgrade-path.rst

.. |downgrading| replace:: downgrading


Create Backup
-------------

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.


Prerequisites
-------------

To downgrade from |newversion| to |oldversion|, you must remove
incompatible features that are persisted and/or update incompatible
configuration settings.

.. note::

   If you ran a :ref:`resharding operation <sharding-resharding>` and a
   primary failover occurred during the resharding operation, you must
   run :dbcommand:`cleanupReshardCollection` before downgrading the
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of your sharded cluster.

   If you started a :ref:`resharding operation <sharding-resharding>`,
   and it is still running while you downgrade the
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of your sharded cluster, the
   resharding operation will abort.

1. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version (fCV)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To downgrade the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of your sharded
cluster:

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the |target|.

#. .. include:: /includes/5.0-downgrade-fcv.rst

   .. note:: 

      While :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` is running on
      the sharded cluster, chunk migrations, splits, and merges
      can fail with ``ConflictingOperationInProgress``.

#. To ensure that all members of the sharded cluster reflect the
   updated ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, connect to each shard replica
   set member and each config server replica set member and check the
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

   .. tip::

      For a sharded cluster that has access control enabled, to run the
      following command against a shard replica set member, you must
      connect to the member as a :ref:`shard local user
      <shard-local-users>`.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

   All members should return a result that includes:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "4.4" }

   If any member returns a ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of |newfcv|,
   wait for the member to reflect version |oldfcv| before proceeding.

For more information on the returned ``featureCompatibilityVersion``
value, see :ref:`view-fcv`.

2. Remove fCV |newversion| Persisted Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps are necessary only if fCV has ever been set to
|newfcv|.

Remove all persisted |newversion| |features| that are incompatible with
|oldversion|. These include:

- This list is forthcoming.

3. Remove |newversion| Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remove all persisted features that use |newversion| features. These
include but are not limited to:

- This list is forthcoming.

.. |binary| replace:: any :binary:`~bin.mongod`/:binary:`~bin.mongos` instance

Procedure
---------

Downgrade a Sharded Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Before proceeding with the downgrade procedure, ensure that all
   members, including delayed replica set members in the sharded
   cluster, reflect the prerequisite changes.  That is, check the
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` and the removal of incompatible
   features for each node before downgrading.
