   MongoDB Version
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Queryable backups are available for:
      
   - MongoDB 3.2 or later replica sets or

   - MongoDB 3.2 or later sharded clusters with replica set config
     servers (CSRS).

   For queryable backups/restores of:
      
   - MongoDB 3.6 sharded clusters, backup daemons require MongoDB
     Enterprise 3.6.2 or later.

   - MongoDB 3.6 replica sets, backup daemons require MongoDB 3.4.2
     Enterprise or later.

   - MongoDB 3.4 replica sets or sharded clusters, backup daemons require
     MongoDB 3.4.2 Enterprise or later.

   - MongoDB 3.2 replica sets, backup daemons require MongoDB 3.4.2
     Enterprise or later.

   PEM file
   ~~~~~~~~

   For the queryable backup host, you must specify the location of the
   PEM file using the :setting:`Proxy Server PEM File` setting. If you
   have not already set up the queryable backup settings:

   #. Click on :guilabel:`Admin` on the upper-right hand corner. From 
      the :guilabel:`Admin` screen, click on :guilabel:`General` >
      :guilabel:`Ops Manager Config` > :guilabel:`Backup`.

   #. Scroll to the :guilabel:`Queryable Snapshot Configuration` and
      specify the :setting:`Proxy Server PEM File` that the tunnel or
      clients can use to connect to the queryable :program:`mongod`
      instance.

   #. Optional.  Update other queryable snapshot settings as
      appropriate. For description of the settings, see
      :ref:`queryable-snapshot-settings`.
