  In the :guilabel:`Select Restore Destination` screen's
  :guilabel:`Delivery Method` field, select :guilabel:`Push via Secure
  Copy (SCP)` to transfer the backup to your server via SCP.

title: Enter the SCP details.

  Enter the following:
 
  :guilabel:`Format`: Select the file format. The :guilabel:`Individual DB
  Files` option copies the data files directly to the target directory.
  
  With the :guilabel:`Individual DB Files` format, |onprem| transmits the
  MongoDB data files directly to the target directory. The individual files
  format only requires sufficient space on the destination server for
  the data files.

  In contrast, the :guilabel:`Archive (tar.gz)` option bundles the database
  files into a single ``tar.gz`` archive file, which you must extract before
  reconstruction your databases. This requires temporary space on the server
  hosting the Backup Daemon and sufficient space on the destination server
  to hold the archive file and extract it.
   
  :guilabel:`SCP Host`: Your server.
 
  :guilabel:`SCP Port`: SCP runs over port 22 by default.
 
  :guilabel:`SCP User`: A username for your server.
 
  :guilabel:`Auth Method`: Select either password or SSH as the
  authentication method. See: :doc:`/tutorial/restore-select-delivery-format`
  for details about the authentication methods.
 
  :guilabel:`Password`: If using a password for authentication, enter the
  password. To test the authentication, click :guilabel:`Test`.
 
  :guilabel:`Target Directory`: The server location to which to transfer the snapshot.
