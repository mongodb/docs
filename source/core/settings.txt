=======================
Administer Your Account
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The :guilabel:`Administration` tab lets users personalize
their console and activate or deactivate a variety of features. The
:guilabel:`Administration` tab provides the pages described here.

.. _profile-page:

Account Page
------------

The :guilabel:`Account` page allows users to update their personal
information.

The username, email address, and password are also used for `jira.mongodb.org
<http://jira.mongodb.org>`_. Changing your email address or password in |mms|
will also change the email address and password you use to log into Jira.

- :guilabel:`User Name`: Displays the user's name. You cannot change your
  username.

- :guilabel:`Email Address`: Displays the email address |mms| associates with
  your account. You can change your email address by clicking on the
  ":guilabel:`pencil`" icon.

- :guilabel:`Mobile Phone Number`: The number to use to receive SMS
  alerts, including two-factor authentication codes.

- :guilabel:`Password`: Allows you to change your |mms| password. Passwords must
  fulfill |mms|'s :ref:`password requirements <password-requirements>`.

- :guilabel:`Two-Factor Authentication`: |mms| requires two factor authentication
  for login. For details, see :doc:`/core/two-factor-authentication`.

  .. only:: classic or cloud

     To delete or reset two-factor authentication, `contact |mms| Support
     <https://mms.mongodb.com/links/support>`_.

  .. only:: onprem

     To delete or reset two-factor authentication, contact your |mms| system
     administrator.

.. _mms-personalization:

Personalization Page
--------------------

The :guilabel:`Personalization` page allows users to configure the console
to suit their needs and preferences. The available fields depend on the
user's :doc:`role </reference/user-roles>`.

- :guilabel:`My Time Zone`: Sets your local time zone.

- :guilabel:`My Date Format`: Allows you to select your preferred
  date format.

- :guilabel:`Page Shown When Switching Groups`: Sets which page of the |mms|
  console you will see when you select a different group. If you
  select :guilabel:`Current`, |mms| will not change pages when you select a
  different group.

- :guilabel:`Display Opcounters On Separate Charts`: Allows you to control the
  presentation of Opcounter Charts. If enabled, |mms| charts each opcounter type
  separately. Otherwise, each opcounter type is overlaid together in a single
  chart.

- :guilabel:`Display Chart Annotations`: Toggles the presence of chart
  annotations. Chart annotations overlay information about significant
  system events on the charts. For example, with chart annotations |mms|
  will draw a red vertical line over the charts.

- :guilabel:`Receive |mms| Newsletters`: Allows you to opt-in to, or opt-out of
  receiving e-mail newsletters about |mms|.

API Keys & Whitelists Page
--------------------------

:guilabel:`API Keys & Whitelists` lets you :doc:`generate an API key
</tutorial/enable-public-api>` for your |mms| group. Use the API key to support
automated installation of your Monitoring Agent with scripts included with the
agent installation files.

You can also define an :guilabel:`API Whitelist` of IP addresses permitted
to invoke operations that require a higher level of security. See
:doc:`/tutorial/enable-public-api` for more information.

My Groups Page
--------------

:guilabel:`My Groups` displays the |mms| groups you belong to. From here you
can :ref:`add a group <create-group>`.

.. _group-settings-page:

Group Settings Page
-------------------

These settings are general settings that apply to all users in the
current group.

- :guilabel:`Group Time Zone`: Sets your group's time zone.

- :guilabel:`Collect Logs For All Hosts`: Activates or deactivates the
  collection of log data for all hosts. This overwrites the statuses
  set on the individual hosts.

- :guilabel:`Collect Profiling Information for All Hosts`: Activates or deactivates the
  collection of profiling information for all hosts. |mms| Monitoring can collect
  data from MongoDBâ€™s profiler to provide statistics about performance and
  database operations. Ensure exposing profile data to |mms| Monitoring is
  consistent with your information security practices. Also be aware the
  profiler can consume resources which may adversely affect MongoDB performance.

- :guilabel:`Collect Database Specific Statistics`: Allows you to enable or disable the
  collection of database statistics. For more information, see ":ref:`How does
  |mms| gather database statistics? <db-stats-warning>`".

- :guilabel:`Enable Public API`: Allows you to :doc:`use the Public API
  </tutorial/enable-public-api>` with the group.

- :guilabel:`Reset Duplicates`: Allows you to reset and remove all detected duplicate
  hosts. This is useful if your server environment has drastically changed and
  you believe a host is incorrectly marked as a duplicate.

- :guilabel:`Preferred Hostnames`: Allows you to specify the hostname to use for
  servers with multiple aliases. This prevents servers from appearing multiple
  times under different names. By default, the Monitoring Agent tries to connect
  by resolving hostnames. If the agent cannot connect by resolving a hostname,
  you can force the Monitoring Agent to prefer an IP address over its
  corresponding hostname for a specific IP address. To override this
  default behavior, set an IP address as a preferred hostname. If your IP
  addresses have a common prefix, create a preferred hostname with the
  :guilabel:`ends-with` button or click the :guilabel:`regexp` button to use a
  regular expression.

- :guilabel:`Public Key for SCP Restores`: If you use |mms| :doc:`Backup
  </tutorial/nav/backup-use>`, this setting allows you to generate a
  public key for SCP backup restoration. If you restore a snapshot through
  SCP, |mms| uses the key to transmit the snapshot. For more information on
  restores, see :doc:`/tutorial/nav/backup-use-restore`, and :ref:`how to
  validate an SCP restore <backup-faq-scp-validation>` and other SCP FAQs.

- :guilabel:`PagerDuty Service Key`: Adds a service key for a
  `PagerDuty <http://www.pagerduty.com/?utm_source=mongodb&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partner>`_
  account. This is the default key used if you :ref:`create an alert
  configuration <create-new-alert-configuration>` that uses PageDuty.

- :guilabel:`HipChat Settings`: Adds a room and API token for a HipChat
  account. These are the default settings used if you :ref:`create an
  alert configuration <create-new-alert-configuration>` that uses HipChat.

Users Page
----------

:guilabel:`Users` displays the group's users and their :doc:`roles
</reference/user-roles>`. From here you can :doc:`add and manage users
</tutorial/manage-users>`.

Agents Page
-----------

The :guilabel:`Agent` page displays the status of your installed agent and
provides links to download new agents, in both ``.zip`` and ``.tar.gz``
formats. The software is dynamically assembled with your API key.
Instructions are included to set up and start the downloaded agent, as
well as create a new user for the agent if MongoDB authentication is used.

The :guilabel:`Agents` page includes the following information about your
installed agents:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Field

     - Description

     - Indicates whether the agent is active.

   * - :guilabel:`Ping Count`

   * - :guilabel:`Log`

     - Click :guilabel:`view logs` to view the agent's log.

.. only:: classic or onprem

   monitors MongoDB instances at a time. See :ref:`Monitoring Architecture
   <monitoring-agent-redundancy>` for more information.

.. only:: cloud

   AWS Settings Page
   -----------------

   - :guilabel:`AWS Provisioning Settings`: Adds an access key for use
     when :doc:`provisioning a new AWS server
     </tutorial/provision-aws-servers>`.

     logging into a server that has been :doc:`provisioned on AWS
