What GenAI Features Does MongoDB Currently Offer?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB offers various generative AI (GenAI) capabilities in its 
products and services, including within Atlas and in its software 
products. 

For example, in MongoDB Compass and Charts, Atlas users can
leverage natural language to generate queries or visualizations. With
MongoDB Relational Migrator, GenAI can be leveraged for query
conversions. And within MongoDB for VS Code, the MongoDB Github Copilot
participant allows developers to generate MongoDB-related code more
efficiently through Github Copilot Chat.

We also offer a GenAI chatbot within our MongoDB Documentation. 

What Services Do These GenAI Features Rely On?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB's current GenAI features are powered by `Azure OpenAI
<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service>`__,
except that the participant within MongoDB for VS Code is powered by
Github Copilot. When you use these features, your data is processed in
Microsoft Azure using the Azure OpenAI service or by the Github Copilot
service. 

Data processed in these services is not used for any model training.
MongoDB has opted out of asynchronous `Abuse Monitoring
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/abuse-monitoring>`__
so that no prompts or responses are stored with Azure OpenAI. For more
detail, refer to `Azure OpenAI's data management practices
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy>`__.
For information about how Github Copilot processes data, please refer to
the `Github Trust Center <https://copilot.github.trust.page>`__.

What Data Is Sent To The Model?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each MongoDB tool backed by GenAI sends the minimal required 
information to produce the best possible answer. To learn more 
about what each tool sends, please consult our documentation:

- `Compass <https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/compass-ai-data-usage>`__
- `Atlas Charts <https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/charts-ai-data-usage>`__
- `Relational Migrator <https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/migrator-ai-data-usage>`__
- `MongoDB for VSCode <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-vscode/ai-data-usage/>`__

Are Outputs from my Use of MongoDB GenAI Features Used to Train Models?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No.

Does MongoDB Store my Inputs or their Corresponding Outputs to GenAI Features?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB may store inputs and outputs from the GenAI service for a 
limited time period (up to one year) for troubleshooting, analytics, and
feature improvement.
For any GenAI capabilities offered in our on-premise software 
(Relational Migrator and Compass) you may opt out, in which case
MongoDB will not store your inputs or outputs.

What Agreements Govern My Use of MongoDB's GenAI Features?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your use of these features is subject to your applicable MongoDB legal 
agreement, our
`Acceptable Use Policy <https://www.mongodb.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy>`_ and 
our `Privacy Policy <https://www.mongodb.com/legal/privacy/privacy-policy>`__.
