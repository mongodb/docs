Rolling index builds are an alternative to :ref:`the default index
builds <index-operations>`. Rolling indexes build indexes on the
applicable nodes sequentially and may reduce the performance impact of
an index build if your deployment matches one of the following cases:

- If your average CPU utilization exceeds (N-1)/N-10% where N is the
  number of CPU threads available to mongod
- If the WiredTiger cache fill ratio regularly exceeds 90%

If your deployment does not meet this criteria, use the
:ref:`default index build <index-operations>`. 

Considerations
--------------

- Rolling index builds hide at most one replica set member at a time,
  starting with the secondary members, and build the index on that member
  as a standalone. 

- Rolling index builds require at least one replica set
  election.
