            Private Endpoint Concepts 
            -------------------------

            When you enable PrivateLink in |aws| and private
            endpoints in |service|, |aws| and |service| create the following resources to support secure connections over 
            |vpc|\s:

            .. list-table::
               :header-rows: 1

                   your |service| |vpc| that places {+database-deployments+} within a region behind a network load balancer. |aws| refers to the endpoint
                   service as the :guilabel:`VPC endpoint service`.

                 - |aws| |vpc| endpoint with a private IP address
                   that sends traffic to the private endpoint service over |aws| PrivateLink. |aws| refers to the

            Private Endpoint Concepts 
            -------------------------
            
            When you enable this feature, |azure| and |service| create
            the following resources to support secure connections over 
            VNets:

                 - |service|
                 - A collection of private endpoint resources within
                   your |service| VNet that places
                   {+database-deployments+} within a region behind a
                   network load balancer.

               * - Private endpoint
                 - |azure| and |service| together
                 - A generic term for the private
                   connection established
                   between |service| and your cloud provider. For 
                   |azure|, that connection is established using Private Link.
                   
            |service| creates a Private 
            Link service and places clusters within a region behind a 
            load balancer in the |service| VNet.

            Then you create resources that establish a one-way 
            connection from your VNet to the :azure:`Private Link 
            service </private-link/private-link-service-overview>` in 
            the |service| VNet using a private endpoint. The Private 
            Link service routes traffic to the load balancer that 
            fronts the clusters in the |service| VNet.

            Private Endpoint Concepts 
            -------------------------

            When you enable this feature, |gcp| and |service| create
            the following resources to support secure connections over 
            |vpc|\s:

            .. list-table::
               :header-rows: 1

                 - |service|
                 - A collection of private endpoint resources within
                   your |service| |vpc| that places
                   {+database-deployments+} within a region behind
                   network load balancers.

               * - Private endpoints
                 - |gcp| and |service| together
                 - A generic term for the private
                   connections established
                   between |service| and your cloud provider. For 
                   |gcp|, those connections are established using
                   Private Service Connect.

            When you enable {+gcp-psc+} in |gcp|, |service|
            creates a private endpoint service using :gcp:`service attachments 
            </vpc/docs/private-service-connect#service-attachments>`
            and load balancers.
      
            Next, you create resources that establish a one-way 
            connection from your |vpc| to the private endpoint service 
            in |service| using a private endpoint. The private endpoint 
            service routes traffic to the load balancers for the 
            {+clusters+} in the |service| |vpc|.

            To ensure the availability of resources for both current 
            and future {+clusters+}, |service| performs the following 
            actions when you enable this feature:

            .. include:: /includes/gcp-psc-connection-workflow.rst

            .. tabs::

                  The following diagram shows how {+gcp-psc+}
                  establishes connections when you have one {+cluster+}
                  in one region.

                           one cluster in one region. Lighter colored
                           lines represent potential connections to
                           addresses that |service| reserves.

                  The following diagram shows how {+gcp-psc+}
                  establishes connections when you have two 
                  {+clusters+} in one region.

                  .. figure:: /images/google-psc-diagram-two-clusters.svg

                           two clusters in one region. Lighter colored
                           lines represent potential connections to
                           addresses that |service| reserves.
               

            Connections to |service| clusters using private endpoints 
            offer the following advantages over other network access 
            management options:

            - Connections to private endpoints are one-way. |service| 
              |vpc|\s can't initiate connections back to your |gcp| 
              |vpc|\s. This ensures your perceived network trust 
              boundary is not extended. 
            - You can connect to private endpoints within your |vpc| 
              transitively from an on-premises data center connected 
              with Google Cloud VPN to the private endpoint-connected 
              |vpc|. This enables you to connect to |service| directly 
              from your on-premises data center without adding public IP
              addresses to the |service| access list.

            You don't need to take additional actions to ensure that

            withstand an availability zone outage.

            Multi-Region Support
            ````````````````````
            
            {+gcp-psc+} now provides multi-region support for your 
            |service| {+database-deployments+}. You can configure :gcp:`global access 
            </vpc/docs/about-accessing-vpc-hosted-services-endpoints#global-access>`
            to connect to private endpoints from a different |gcp| region. 
            By using global access, you can ensure high availability for 
            your multi-region {+database-deployments+}, single-region deployments 
            hosted in a different region than your own, and |gcp| nodes in your 
            multi-cloud deployments.

            |service| services are accessed through

            (but not limited to) cluster changes.

            .. important::
               MongoDB strongly recommends using the DNS seedlist 
               private endpoint-aware connection string, so that DNS 
               automatically updates the ports that {+gcp-psc+} uses if
               they change. For the same reason, MongoDB also strongly 
               recommends allow-listing the entire port range, instead
               of specific ports.

              .. note::

                 Each private endpoint in |gcp| reserves an IP address

            - |gcp| {+google-psc+} supports up to 1024 outgoing 
              connections per virtual machine. As a result, you can't 
              have more than 1024 connections from a single |gcp| 
              virtual machine to an |service| cluster.

              To learn more, see the |gcp|
              :gcp:`cloud NAT documentation 
              </nat/docs/ports-and-addresses>`.

            - |gcp| {+google-psc+} is region-specific. However, you
              can configure :gcp:`global access 
              </vpc/docs/about-accessing-vpc-hosted-services-endpoints#global-access>`
              to access private endpoints from a different region.
              
              To learn more, see :ref:`Multi-Region Support <private-endpoint-ha>`.

              .. note:: 

                 You can't use |vpc| peering to access private endpoints 
                 from a different region. 

            -  When you use {+google-psc+} to connect to multi-region
               {+clusters+}, you can connect only to {+cluster+} nodes 
               that are in the same region as the private endpoint. If 
               the endpoint and the primary node are in different 
               regions, you must:

               1. Set your application's
                  :manual:`read preference </core/read-preference/>`
                  to allow connections from a secondary node.

                  For example, you can set your application's read 
                  preference to :manual:`secondaryPreferred </core/read-preference/#mongodb-readmode-secondaryPreferred>`.

               2. Ensure at least one secondary node is in the same 
                  region as the endpoint.

      - Before you can deploy a private endpoint to a region, 
        you must first resume any paused {+database-deployments+} 
        in your project with nodes deployed to that region.

      - Private endpoints for {+serverless-instances+} apply at the 
        {+database-deployment+} level. If you configure a private
        endpoint for a {+serverless-instance+}, that private endpoint 
        can't be used for other {+serverless-instances+} or {+clusters+}
        in the same project. You must configure a separate private endpoint for each {+serverless-instance+}.

      - You can connect up to two private endpoints per 
        {+serverless-instance+}.
