Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: balancerStop

   Disables the balancer in a sharded cluster. If a balancing round is
   in progress, the operation waits for balancing to complete.

   You can only issue the :dbcommand:`balancerStop` against the
   ``admin`` database on a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

   In MongoDB versions earlier than 6.1, the command disables
   auto-splitting for the sharded cluster. To enable auto-splitting when
   the balancer is disabled, you can use :method:`sh.enableAutoSplit()`.
