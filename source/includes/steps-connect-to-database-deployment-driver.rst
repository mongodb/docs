      :guilabel:`Choose Connection Type` from the set of available buttons.

         |service| displays the connection type options after you enable
         :doc:`Private IP for Peering </security-vpc-peering>`,
         :ref:`Private Endpoint <atlas-configure-private-endpoint>`, or
         both. If you haven't enabled either feature, no buttons display
         and **Connection Type** defaults to **Standard**.

         .. tab:: Standard Connection
            :tabid: standard
      
            Use this connection type for allowed public IP addresses.
      
         .. tab:: Private IP for Peering
            :tabid: peering
      
            Use this connection type if you enabled peering:
      
            - For |gcp| or |azure| and are connecting with your driver
              from a peered network, or
            - For |aws| and are connecting with your driver from a
              peered network which uses a custom |dns| service.
      
            If neither of these apply, add your IP address to your IP
            access list and use the Standard Connection string. If you are
            connecting directly to |service| from an office or home
            network, this might be the preferred option.
      
            .. note:: Peer must be available
      
               You can't select this option unless one of your peers
               is marked as ``AVAILABLE``. To

            .. note:: Multi-Cloud Clusters
      
               If your application isn't hosted on the same cloud service
               provider as your cluster's :term:`primary`, the application
               can only perform secondary reads.
      
               With multi-cloud clusters, consider adding the
               :manual:`readPreference </reference/connection-string#read-preference-options>`
               connection option to your
               :manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string>`.
               Use one of the following values:
      
               - :readmode:`primaryPreferred`
               - :readmode:`secondary`
               - :readmode:`secondaryPreferred`
      
         .. tab:: Private Endpoint Connection
            :tabid: private
      
            Use the connection string for the appropriate interface
            endpoint if you are connecting with your driver over a
            Private Endpoint connection either because your driver:
      
            - Runs inside your cloud provider network, or
            - Has transitive network access to your cloud provider network.
            - You want to use an :ref:`optimized connection string
              <optimized-connection-strings>`.
      
            If none of these apply, add your IP address to your IP
            access list and use the Standard Connection string. If you are
            connecting directly to |service| from an office or home
            network, this might be the preferred option.
      
            .. note::
      
               You can't select this option unless your configured
               PrivateLink connection is ready to use. To

               :guilabel:`Setup connection security` step that you have
               already configured an IP access list entry in your {+database-deployment+}.
               To manage the IP access list, see
               :ref:`Add Entries to the Access List <access-list>`.
      
            |service| allows standard client connections to the {+database-deployment+}
            from entries in the :ref:`project's IP access list
            <access-list>`. The project IP access list differs from the
            :ref:`API access list <enable-api-access-list>`, which
            restricts *API* access to specific IP or |cidr| addresses.
      
            If the IP access list is empty, |service| prompts you to add an
            IP address to the project's IP access list. You can either:
      
            - Click :guilabel:`Add Your Current IP Address` to allow
              access from your current IP address.
      
            - Click :guilabel:`Add an IP Address` to add a single IP
              address or a |cidr|\-notated range of addresses.
      
            Provide an optional description for the newly added IP address
            or |cidr| range. Click :guilabel:`Add IP Address` to add the
            address to the IP access list.

            If the IP access list is empty, |service| prompts you to add an
            IP address to the project's IP access list. Click
            :guilabel:`Add a Different IP Address` to add a single IP
            address or a |cidr|\-notated range of addresses.
      
            Provide an optional description for the newly added IP address
            or |cidr| range. Click :guilabel:`Add IP Address` to add the

   .. step:: Create a Database User.
      
      .. important::
      
         **Skip this step** if |service| indicates in the
         :guilabel:`Setup connection security` step that you have at least
         one database user configured in your project. To manage existing
         database users, see :ref:`mongodb-users`.
      
      To access the {+database-deployment+}, you need a MongoDB user with access to the
      desired database or databases on the {+database-deployment+} in your project. If your
      project has no MongoDB users, |service| prompts you to create a new
      user with the :ref:`Atlas Admin <atlas-user-privileges>` role.
      
      a. Enter the new user's :guilabel:`Username`.
      b. Enter a :guilabel:`Password` for this new user or click
         :guilabel:`Autogenerate Secure Password`.
          
      c. Click :guilabel:`Create Database User` to save the user.
      
      Use this user to connect to your {+database-deployment+} in the following step.
      
      Once you have added an IP address to your IP access list and added a
      database user, click :guilabel:`Choose Your Connection Method`.
      
   .. step:: Select :guilabel:`Drivers`.
      
      In the :guilabel:`Choose a connection method` step, select
      :guilabel:`Drivers`.

      Select your driver and version from the dropdown menus.
      The code sample containing a connection string displays.
      Replace ``<password>`` with the password specified when you created
      your database user.
