  a. Create a file named ``compound-constant-query.js``. 
  #. Copy and paste the code example into the 
     ``compound-constant-query.js`` file.

     The code example performs the following tasks:

     - Imports ``mongodb``, MongoDB's Node.js driver.
     - Creates an instance of the ``MongoClient`` class to establish a 
       connection to your |service| cluster.
     - Uses the following compound clauses to query the collection: 

       .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-compound-constant-desc.rst

     - .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-compound-highlight-desc.rst

     - Uses the following pipeline stages:

       .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-compound-score-stages.rst

     - Iterates over the cursor to print the documents that match the 
       query.
