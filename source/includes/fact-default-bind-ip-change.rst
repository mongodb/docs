Starting with MongoDB 3.6, MongoDB binaries, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
:binary:`~bin.mongos`, bind to ``localhost`` by default.
From MongoDB versions 2.6 to 3.4, only the binaries from the
official MongoDB RPM (Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora Linux, and derivatives)
and DEB (Debian, Ubuntu, and derivatives) packages would bind to 
``localhost`` by default. To learn more about this change, see 
:ref:`3.6-bind_ip-compatibility`.
