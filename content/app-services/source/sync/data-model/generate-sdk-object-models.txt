Overview
--------

Atlas App Services can automatically translate your server-side document schemas to a Realm Object Schema that will
work with your SDK of choice. You can generate the object models using either the App Services UI or CLI.

Procedure
---------

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui
      
      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Navigate to the SDKs Screen

            To begin, navigate to the
            :guilabel:`SDKs` screen under the :guilabel:`Build` section in the 
            left navigation menu. Here you will find the tools to make your app 
            compatible with different SDKs.

         .. step:: Select the Data Models Tab

            In the :guilabel:`Data Models` tab, you can view the generated 
            object models for your  SDK. Use the :guilabel:`Language` dropdown 
            to choose the language you are using for development.
            The page updated with a generated version of each of your object types 
            translated to the language you choose.

               :alt: Supported languages for object models

         .. step:: Copy the Data Models

            Click on the :guilabel:`Copy All Data Models` button to copy the code 
            for all object models. If prompted, choose whether you want to include 
            the import statements (the default is to include them) and then click 
            the :guilabel:`Copy` button. You are now ready to paste these 
            generated object models into your own app code.

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Generate Data Models Based On Your Schema

            To begin generating the data object models for your app, run the following:

            .. code-block:: shell

               {+cli-bin+} schema datamodels -a "<Your App ID>"


         .. step:: Confirm Options for Generating Data Models

            You will be prompted for the following details:

            .. code-block::

               ? Select the language you would like to generate data models in
               ? Would you like to omit imports?
               ? Would you like group all generated data models together?

            1. Select from the list of available languages which language you would like
               your object models to be in

            #. Choose whether you'd like to omit import statements from your data models

            #. Choose whether you'd like the data model for each schema to be
               grouped together in the output


         .. step:: Use Your Data Model

            Copy and paste the object models from your terminal into your code.
