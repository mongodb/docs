Add the following code to the asynchronous function that you defined in your ``get-started.js`` file.
This code creates an index of the :ref:`vectorSearch <avs-types-vector-search>` type that indexes the following fields:

- ``embedding`` field as the :ref:`vector <avs-types-vector-search>` type. The ``embedding`` field
  contains the embeddings created using Voyage AI's ``voyage-3-large`` embedding model. The index
  definition specifies ``1024`` vector dimensions and measures similarity using ``cosine``.
- ``loc.pageNumber`` field as the :ref:`filter <avs-types-vector-search>` type for pre-filtering data
  by the page number in the PDF.

This code also uses an await function to ensure that your search index has :ref:`synced <troubleshoot-initial-sync>` to your data before it's used.
