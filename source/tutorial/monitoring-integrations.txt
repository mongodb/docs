You can use a third-party application to view and analyze
:ref:`performance metrics <monitor-cluster-metrics>` that |service|
collects about your cluster.

At this time, you can either build a monitoring integration using the
|service| |api| or integrate |service| with |datadog|.

Build Monitoring Integrations with |service| API
------------------------------------------------

You can build a monitoring integration using the |service|
:doc:`API monitoring and logs endpoints
</reference/api/monitoring-and-logs/>`.

.. _datadog-integration:

Integrate |service| with Datadog
--------------------------------

You can configure |service| to send metric data about your project to
your |datadog| dashboards.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To integrate |service| with Datadog, you must have a Datadog account
and a Datadog |api| key. Datadog grants you an |api| key when you first
create a Datadog account.

If you do not have an existing Datadog account, you can sign up at
`<https://app.datadoghq.com/signup>`__.

Procedure
