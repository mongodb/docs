Synopsis
--------

Indexes allow MongoDB to process and fulfill queries quickly, by
creating an small and efficient representation of the documents in the
collection. Read the ":doc:`/core/indexes`" documentation for more
information on the fundamentals of indexing in MongoDB, and the
":doc:`/administration/indexes`" documentation for operational
guidelines and examples for building and managing indexes.

This document provides an overview of approaches to indexing with
MongoDB and a selection of strategies that you can use as you develop
applications with MongoDB.

Strategies
----------

.. _covered-queries:
.. _indexes-covered-queries:

Use Covered Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some cases, MongoDB will be able to fulfill a query using *only*
the index, without needing to scan actual documents from the
database. To use a covered index you must:

- ensure that the index includes all of the fields in the result.

  This means that the :term:`projection`, must explicitly exclude the
  ``_id`` field from the result set, unless the index includes
  ``_id``.

- if any of the indexed fields in any of the documents in the
  collection includes an array, then the index becomes a
  :ref:`multi-key index <index-type-multi-key>` index, and cannot
  support a covered query.

Use the :func:`explain() <cursor.explain()>` to test the query. If
MongoDB was able to use a covered index, then the value of the
``indexOnly`` field will be ``true``.

Covered queries are much faster than other queries, for two reasons:
indexes are typically stored in RAM *or* located sequentially on
disk, and indexes are smaller than the documents they catalog.

.. _index-sort:
.. _sorting-with-indexes:

Sort Using Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the :func:`sort() <cursor.sort()>` method supports in-memory
sort operations without the use of an index, these operations are:

#. Significantly slower than sort operations that use an index.

#. Abort when the sort operation consume 32 megabytes of memory.

For the best result, index the field you want sorted query
results. For example:

- if you have an ``{ username: 1 }`` index, you can use this index to
  return documents sorted by the ``username`` field.

  *MongoDB can return sorted results in either ascending or descending
  order using an index in ascending or descending order,* because
  MongoDB can transverse items in the index in both
  directions. For more information about index order see the section
  on ":ref:`Ascending and Descending Index Order
  <index-ascending-and-descending>`."

- In general, MongoDB can use a compound index to return sorted
  results *if*:

  - the first sorted field is first field in the index.

  - the last field in the index before the first sorted field is an
    equality match in the query.

  Consider the example presented below for an illustration of this
  concept.

.. example::

   Given the following index:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { a: 1, b: 1, c: 1, d: 1 }

   The following query and sort operations will be able to use the
   index:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find().sort( { a:1 } )
      db.collection.find().sort( { a:1, b:1 } )

      db.collection.find( { a:4 } ).sort( { a:1, b:1 } )
      db.collection.find( { b:5 } ).sort( { a:1, b:1 } )

      db.collection.find( { a:{ $gt:4 } } ).sort( { a:1, b:1 } )
      db.collection.find( { b:{ $gt:5 } } ).sort( { a:1, b:1 } )

      db.collection.find( { a:5 } ).sort( { a:1, b:1 } )
      db.collection.find( { a:5 } ).sort( { b:1, c:1 } )

      db.collection.find( { a:5, c:4, b:3 } ).sort( { d:1 } )

      db.collection.find( { a:5, b:3, d:{ $gt:4 } } ).sort( { c:1 } )
      db.collection.find( { a:5, b:3, c:{ $lt:2 }, d:{ $gt:4 } } ).sort( { c:1 } )

   However, the following query operations would not be able to sort
   data using the index:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find().sort( { b:1 } )
      db.collection.find( { b:5 } ).sort( { b:1 } )
      db.collection.find( { b:{ $gt:5 } } ).sort( { a:1, b:1 } )

Store Indexes in Memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For best results, always ensure that your indexes fit entirely in RAM,
so the system doesn't need to read the index from disk to
fulfill a query. If your indexes approach or exceed the total size of
available RAM, they may not fit in memory.

You can check the size of your indexes in the :program:`mongo` shell,
using the :func:`db.collection.totalIndexSize()` helper. You may also
use :dbcommand:`collStats` or :func:`db.collection.stats()` to return
this and :doc:`related information </reference/collection-statistics>`.

:func:`db.collection.totalIndexSize()` returns data in bytes. Consider
the following invocation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   > db.collection.totalIndexSize()
   4294976499

This reports a total index size of roughly 4 gigabytes. Consider this
value in contrast to the total amount of available system RAM and the
rest of the :term:`working set`. Also remember:

- if you have and use multiple collections to consider the size of
  all indexes on all collections.

- there are some :ref:`limited cases where indexes do not need to fit
  in RAM <indexing-right-handed>`.

Considerations
--------------

Above all, when developing your indexing strategy you should have a
deep understanding of:

- the application's queries.

- the relative frequency of each query in the application.

- the current indexes created for your collections.

- which indexes the most common queries use.

MongoDB can only use *one* index to support any given
operation. However, each clause of an :operator:`$or` query can use
its own index.

.. _index-selectivity:

Selectivity
~~~~~~~~~~~

Selectivity describes the ability of a query to narrow the result set
using the index. Effective indexes are more selective and allow
MongoDB to use the index for a larger portion of the work associated
with fulfilling the query. There are two aspects of selectivity:

#. Data need to have a high distribution of the values for the indexed
   key.

#. Queries need to limit the number of possible documents using the
   indexed field.

.. example::

   First, consider an index, ``{ a : 1 }``, on a collection where
   ``a`` has three values evenly distributed across the collection:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 1, b: "ab" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 1, b: "cd" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 1, b: "ef" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 2, b: "jk" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 2, b: "lm" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 2, b: "no" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 3, b: "pq" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 3, b: "rs" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 3, b: "tv" }

   If you do a query for ``{ a: 2, b: "no" }`` MongoDB will still need
   to scan 3 documents of the :term:`documents <document>` in the
   collection to fulfill the query. Similarly, a query for ``{ a: {
   $gt: 1}, b: "tv" }``, would need to scan through 6 documents,
   although both queries would return the same result.

   Then, consider an index on a field that has many values evenly
   distributed across the collection:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 1, b: "ab" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 2, b: "cd" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 3, b: "ef" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 4, b: "jk" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 5, b: "lm" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 6, b: "no" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 7, b: "pq" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 8, b: "rs" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 9, b: "tv" }

   Although the index on ``a`` is more selective, in the sense that
   queries can use the index more effectively, a query such as ``{ a:
   { $gt: 5 }, b: "tv" }`` would still need to scan 4 documents. By
   contrast, given a query like ``{ a: 2, b: "cd" }``, MongoDB would
   only need to scan one document to fulfill the rest of the
   query. The index and query are more selective because the values of
   ``a`` are evenly distributed *and* the query can selects a specific
   document using the index.

To ensure optimal performance, use indexes that are maximally
selective relative to your queries. At the same time queries need to
be appropriately selective relative to your indexed data. If overall
selectivity is low enough, and MongoDB must read a number of documents
to return results, then some queries may perform faster without
indexes. See the :ref:`indexes-measuring-use` section for more
information on testing information.

Insert Throughput
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. TODO insert link to /source/core/write-operations when that page is complete.

MongoDB must update all indexes associated with a collection after
every insert, update, or delete operation.

Every index on a collection adds
some amount of overhead to these operations. In almost every case, the
performance gains that indexes realize for read operations are worth
the insertion penalty; however:

- in some cases, an index to support an infrequent query may incur
  more insert-related costs than saved read-time.

- in some situations, if you have many indexes on a collection with a
  high insert throughput and a number of very similar indexes, you may
  find better overall results by using a slightly less effective index
  on some queries if it means consolidating the total number of
  indexes.

- If your indexes and queries are not very selective, the speed
  improvements for query operations may not offset the costs of
  maintaining an index. See the section on :ref:`index selectivity
  <index-selectivity>` for more information.

- In some cases a single compound on two or more fields index may
  support all of the queries that index on a single field index, or a
  smaller compound index. In general, MongoDB can use compound index
  to support the same queries as any of its prefixes. Consider the
  following example:

  .. example::

     Given the following index on a collection:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 }

     Can support a number of queries as well as most of the queries
     that the following indexes support:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { x: 1 }
        { x: 1, y: 1 }

     There are some situations where the prefix indexes may offer
     better query performance as is the case if ``z`` is a large
     array. Also, consider the following index on the same collection:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { x: 1, z: 1 }

     The ``{ x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 }`` index can support many of the same
     queries as the above index; however, ``{ x: 1, z: 1 }`` has
     additional use: Given the following query:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.collection.find( { x: 5 } ).sort( { z: 1} )

     The ``{ x: 1, z: 1 }`` will support both the query and the sort
     operation, while the ``{ x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 }`` index can only
     support the query.

     See the :ref:`sorting-with-indexes` section for more
     information.

Index Size
~~~~~~~~~~

Indexes require space, both on disk and in RAM. Indexes require less
space in RAM than the full documents in the collection. In theory, if
your queries only match a subset of the documents and can use the
index to locate those documents, MongoDB can maintain a much smaller
:term:`working set`. Ensure that:

- the indexes and the working set can fit RAM at the same time.

- all of your indexes use less space than all of the documents in the
  collection. This may not be an issue all of your queries use
  :ref:`covered queries <covered-queries>` or indexes do not need to
  fit into ram, as in the following situation:

.. _indexing-right-handed:

Indexes do not have to fit *entirely* into RAM in all cases. If the
value of the indexed field grows with every insert, and most queries
select recently added documents; then MongoDB only needs to keep the
parts of the index that hold the most recent or "right-most" values in
RAM. This allows for efficient index use for read and write
operations and minimize the amount of RAM required to support the
index.

.. To determine the size of the index, see DOCS-224
