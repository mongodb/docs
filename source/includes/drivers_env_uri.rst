            You can create a URI string for your session in MongoDB
            Guides by copying and pasting your Atlas connection string
            in the form below. Once you copy the string here, any
            relevant code examples within the MongoDB Guides will be
            populated with a URI string.  If you have not already
            retrieved your Atlas connection string, see
            :doc:`/cloud/connectionstring` guide.

     - id: local
       content: |

         The URI string used in the guides assumes you have set up
         authentication for your MongoDB instance, and have created a
         username and password for read and write access to a MongoDB
         database.
       
         If you have already set up a user with the
         ``readWriteAnyDatabase`` role through  the :doc:`/server/auth`
         guide, you may use that username and password here, along
         with the `admin` database in your connection string.

         .. note::

            The URI form below allows you to create a URI string for
            your session in MongoDB Guides by filling out a form. Once
            you fill out the form, any relevant code examples within the
            MongoDB Guides will be populated with a URI string. You can
            change these at any time by repopulating the form.
