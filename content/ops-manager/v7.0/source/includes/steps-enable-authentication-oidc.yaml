  Provide the following values:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 30 25 45
     :stub-columns: 1

     * - Setting
       - Necessity
       - Value

     * - :guilabel:`Audience`
       - Required
       - Specify who your OIDC provider intends the token for.

     * - :guilabel:`Issuer URI`
       - Required
       - Issuer value provided by your registered |idp| application.
         Using this URI, MongoDB finds an OpenID Provider Configuration
         Document, which should be available in the
         ``/.wellknown/open-id-configuration`` endpoint.

     * - :guilabel:`Client ID`
       - Required
       - Unique identifier for your registered application. Enter
         the ``clientId`` value from the app you registered
         with |oidc| |idp|.

     * - :guilabel:`Requested Scopes`
       - Optional
       - Tokens that give users permission to request data
         from the authorization endpoint.

         For each additional scope you want to add, click :guilabel:`Add
         more scopes`.

     * - :guilabel:`User Claim`
       - Optional
       - The identifier of the claim that includes the user principal
         identity. Accept the default value unless your |idp| uses a
         different claim.
          
         *Default*: ``sub``

     * - :guilabel:`Groups Claim`
       - Optional
       - The identifier of the claim that includes the principal's |idp|
         user group membership information. Accept the default value
         unless your |idp| uses a different claim, or you need a custom 
         claim. 

         *Default*: ``groups``
