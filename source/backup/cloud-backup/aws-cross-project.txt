|service| provides efficient cross-project restores for 
{+database-deployments+} that have {+gcp+} and {+azure+} nodes. If you 
have {+database-deployments+} with {+aws+} nodes created before 
March 27, 2024, you can enable faster cross-project restores.
|service| automatically provides efficient cross-project restores for 
{+database-deployments+} with {+aws+} nodes created after March 
27, 2024.

Considerations
--------------

- The :guilabel:`Faster Restore` button appears only for 
  |service| {+database-deployments+} with {+aws+} nodes created before 
  March 27, 2024. This button doesn't appear for 
  :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas for Government </government>` 
  {+database-deployments+}

- When you enable faster cross-project restores, |service| replaces 
  each node in your {+database-deployments+} in a rolling fashion 
  during your next maintenance window.

- This replacement might take longer than the defined maintenance 
  window.
  
- Secondary reads and analytic nodes are unavailable during this 
  change.

- When the replacement completes, |service| sends an email confirmation.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Go to your {+database-deployments+}.
    
      Click :guilabel:`Database` in the top-left corner of |service|.

   .. step:: Select your {+database-deployment+}.
    
      From the :guilabel:`{+Database-Deployments+}` view, click on the 
      {+database-deployment+}.

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

      If the {+database-deployment+} has no :guilabel:`Backup` tab, 
      then |service| backups are disabled for that 
      {+database-deployment+} and no 
      snapshots are available. You can enable backups when you
      :ref:`scale the {+database-deployment+} 
      <scale-cluster-backups>`.

   .. step:: Enable faster cross-project restores.

      a. Click the :guilabel:`Faster Restore` button.

         .. note::

            If the :guilabel:`Faster Restore` button is missing or 
            disabled, you already have faster cross-project restores 
            enabled.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Confirm`.
