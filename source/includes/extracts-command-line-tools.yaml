  The {{heading}} section of the :guilabel:`Command Line Tools` tab
  displays a copyable template with the minimum required options for
  connecting {{application}} to your |service| cluster. 
  For instructions on finding the :guilabel:`Command Line Tools` tab,
  see :ref:`view-command-line-tools`.

  The template includes placeholder values for certain options.
  You must replace these placeholders with the appropriate values for
  your |service| cluster:

  - ``<PASSWORD>`` - replace this with the password for the user 
    specified in ``--username``. The template includes a database user
    for the project as the ``--username``. If you want to authenticate 
    as a different user, replace the value of ``--username`` and 
    specify the password for that user in ``--password``.

  {{additionalBullets}}

  Include any other {{application}} command line options as required 
  before copying and pasting the command into your system terminal and 
  executing the full command. See {{application}} for complete 
  documentation on the available command line options and how to use 
  them.

  .. note:: Connecting to an |service| cluster from Microsoft Windows
  
     For users on :abbr:`Windows (Microsoft Windows)`, specify
     {{winapplication}}

     You may need to provide the full file
     path to the {{winapplication}}.
