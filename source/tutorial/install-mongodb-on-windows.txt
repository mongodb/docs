   enable "Secure Mode" by default.

Manually Create a Windows Service for MongoDB Community Edition

You can set up the MongoDB server as a :guilabel:`Windows Service` that
starts automatically at boot time.

The following procedure assumes you have installed MongoDB Community using the
``.msi`` installer with the path ``C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\``.

If you have installed in an alternative directory, you will need to
adjust the paths as appropriate.
