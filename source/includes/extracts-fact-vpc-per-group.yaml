   When |service| deploys an |service| group's first ``M10+`` paid cluster,
   |service| also creates a :abbr:`VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)` specific to
   the selected cloud service provider and region selected for the cluster.
   |service| associates all additional clusters deployed in the group to this
   :abbr:`VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)`, locking them to the cloud service
   provider and region. |service| also sets a default :abbr:`VPC (Virtual
   Private Cloud)` :abbr:`CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)` block address
   for the group.
   
   For clusters deployed on :ref:`amazon-aws`, |service| supports creating
   :doc:`VPC peering connections </security-vpc-peering>` between your
   |service| clusters and your other :abbr:`AWS (Amazon Web Services)`
   services. If you need a specific |service| VPC :abbr:`CIDR (Classless
   Inter-Domain Routing)` block address, configure a :doc:`VPC peering
   connection </security-vpc-peering>` before creating your first ``M10+``
   cluster.
   
   For clusters deployed on the :ref:`google-gcp`, use |service| :ref:`IP
   Whitelisting <whitelist>` to grant your other :abbr:`GCP (Google Cloud
   Platform)` services access to your |service| clusters.
