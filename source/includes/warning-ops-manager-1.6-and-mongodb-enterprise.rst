.. warning::

   To use |onprem| 1.6 Automation to manage :term:`MongoDB Enterprise`
   deployments, you must **first install** the :ref:`MongoDB Enterprise
   dependencies <mongodb-enterprise-dependencies>` to each server that
   runs MongoDB Enterprise. You must install the dependencies to the
   servers before using Automation.

   Note that Automation **does not yet support** use of the MongoDB
   Enterprise advanced security features (SSL, LDAP, Kerberos, and
   auditing). Automation will support these features in the next major
   |onprem| release.

   To run MongoDB Enterprise with advanced security now, deploy MongoDB
   Enterprise manually (not through Automation) and use |onprem| only for
   Monitoring and Backup.
