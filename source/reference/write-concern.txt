Write concern describes the level of acknowledgment requested from
MongoDB for write operations to a standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
to :doc:`replica sets </replication>` or to :doc:`sharded clusters
</sharding>`. In sharded clusters, :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances will
pass the write concern on to the shards.

.. note::

   For :doc:`multi-document transactions </core/transactions>`, you set
   the write concern at the transaction level, not at the individual
   operation level. Do not explicitly set the write concern for
   individual write operations in a transaction.

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, replica sets and sharded clusters support
setting a global default write concern. Operations which do not 
specify an explicit write concern inherit the global default 
write concern settings. See :dbcommand:`setDefaultRWConcern` for 
more information.

.. _wc-specs:

Write Concern Specification
---------------------------

Write concern can include the following fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { w: <value>, j: <boolean>, wtimeout: <number> }

- the :ref:`w <wc-w>` option to request acknowledgment that the write
  operation has propagated to a specified number of :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  instances or to :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances with specified tags.

- the :ref:`j <wc-j>` option to request acknowledgment that the write
  operation has been written to the on-disk journal, and

- the :ref:`wtimeout <wc-wtimeout>` option to specify a time limit to
  prevent write operations from blocking indefinitely.

.. _wc-w:

``w`` Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``w`` option requests acknowledgment that the write operation has
propagated to a specified number of :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances or to
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instances with specified tags.

Using the ``w`` option, the following ``w: <value>`` write concerns are
available:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Value
     - Description

   * - .. writeconcern:: <number>

     - Requests acknowledgment that the write operation has propagated
       to the specified number of :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances. For
       example:

       ``w: 1``
         Requests acknowledgment that the write operation has
         propagated to the standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod` or the primary
         in a replica set. ``w: 1`` is the default write concern for
         MongoDB.

       ``w: 0``
         Requests no acknowledgment of the write operation. However, ``w:
         0`` may return information about socket exceptions and
         networking errors to the application.

         If you specify ``w: 0`` but include :ref:`j: true <wc-j>`, the
         :ref:`j: true <wc-j>` prevails to request acknowledgment from
         the standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod` or the primary of a replica
         set.

       ``w`` greater than 1 requires acknowledgment from the primary and
       as many additional data-bearing secondaries to meet the specified
       write concern. For example, consider a 3-member replica set with
       no :term:`arbiters <Arbiter>`. Specifying ``w: 2`` would
       require acknowledgment from the primary and one of the 
       secondaries. Specifying ``w: 3`` would require acknowledgment 
       from the primary and both secondaries.

       .. note:: 

          :ref:`Hidden <replica-set-hidden-members>`,
          :ref:`delayed <replica-set-delayed-members>`,
          and :ref:`priority 0 <replica-set-secondary-only-members>`
          members can acknowledge 
          :writeconcern:`w: \<number\> <\<number\>>` write operations.

          Delayed secondaries can return write acknowledgment no earlier
          than the configured :rsconf:`~members[n].slaveDelay`. 

       See :ref:`wc-ack-behavior` for when :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances
       acknowledge the write.

   * - .. writeconcern:: "majority"

     - Requests acknowledgment that write operations have propagated to
       the :ref:`calculated majority <calculating-majority-count>` of the
       data-bearing voting members (i.e. primary and secondaries with
       :rsconf:`members[n].votes` greater than ``0``).

       For example, consider a replica set with 3 voting members,
       Primary-Secondary-Secondary (P-S-S). For this replica set,
       :ref:`calculated majority <calculating-majority-count>` is two, and
       the write must propagate to the primary and one secondary to
       acknowledge the write concern to the client.

       .. note:: 

          :ref:`Hidden <replica-set-hidden-members>`,
          :ref:`delayed <replica-set-delayed-members>`,
          and :ref:`priority 0 <replica-set-secondary-only-members>`
          members with :rsconf:`members[n].votes` greater than ``0``
          can acknowledge :writeconcern:`"majority"` write operations.

          Delayed secondaries can return write acknowledgment no earlier
          than the configured :rsconf:`~members[n].slaveDelay`. 

       After the write operation returns with a :writeconcern:`w:
       "majority" <"majority">` acknowledgment to the client, the
       client can read the result of that write with a
       :readconcern:`"majority"` readConcern.

       See :ref:`wc-ack-behavior` for when :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances
       acknowledge the write.

   * - .. writeconcern:: <custom write concern name>

     - Requests acknowledgment that the write operations have
       propagated to :rsconf:`tagged <members[n].tags>` members that
       satisfy the custom write concern defined in
       :rsconf:`settings.getLastErrorModes`. 

       For an example, see :ref:`configure-custom-write-concern`.

       See :ref:`wc-ack-behavior` for when :binary:`~bin.mongod`
       instances acknowledge the write.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/reference/replica-set-protocol-versions`

.. _wc-j:

``j`` Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``j`` option requests acknowledgment from MongoDB that
the write operation has been written to the :doc:`on-disk journal
</core/journaling>`.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80

   * - .. writeconcern:: j

     - If ``j: true``, requests acknowledgment that the
       :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, as specified in the :ref:`w:
       \<value\> <wc-w>`, have written to the on-disk journal. ``j:
       true`` does not by itself guarantee that the write will not be
       rolled back due to replica set primary failover.

       .. versionchanged:: 3.2

          .. include:: /includes/note-write-concern-journaled-replication.rst

.. note::

   - Specifying a write concern that includes ``j: true`` to a
     :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance that is running without journaling
     produces an error.
  
   - If journaling is enabled, :writeconcern:`w:
     "majority" <"majority">` may imply ``j: true``. The
     :rsconf:`writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault` replica set
     configuration setting determines the behavior. See
     :ref:`wc-ack-behavior` for details.

.. _wc-wtimeout:

``wtimeout``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option specifies a time limit, in milliseconds, for the write
concern. ``wtimeout`` is only applicable for ``w`` values greater than
``1``.

``wtimeout`` causes write operations to return with an error
after the specified limit, even if the required write concern will
eventually succeed. When these write operations return,
MongoDB **does not** undo successful data modifications performed
before the write concern exceeded the ``wtimeout`` time limit.

If you do not specify the ``wtimeout`` option and the level of write
concern is unachievable, the write operation will block indefinitely.
Specifying a ``wtimeout`` value of ``0`` is equivalent to a write
concern without the ``wtimeout`` option.

.. _wc-ack-behavior:

Acknowledgment Behavior
-----------------------

The :ref:`w <wc-w>` option and the :ref:`j <wc-j>` option determine
when :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances acknowledge write operations. 

Standalone
~~~~~~~~~~

A standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod` acknowledges a write operation either
after applying the write in memory or after writing to the on-disk
journal. The following table lists the acknowledgment behavior for a
standalone and the relevant write concerns:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 35 40 25 20

   * -
     - ``j`` is unspecified
     - ``j:true``
     - ``j:false``

   * - ``w: 1``
     - In memory
     - On-disk journal
     - In memory

   * - ``w: "majority"``
     - On-disk journal *if running with journaling*
     - On-disk journal
     - In memory

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/no-journaling-rollback.rst

.. _wc-replica-ack-behavior:

Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The value specified to :ref:`w <wc-w>` determines the number
of replica set members that must acknowledge the write before returning
success. For each eligible replica set member, the :ref:`j <wc-j>` 
option determines whether the member acknowledges writes after applying
the write operation in memory or after writing to the on-disk journal.

``w: "majority"``
  Any data-bearing voting member of the replica set can contribute
  to write acknowledgment of :writeconcern:`"majority"` write 
  operations.

  The following table lists when the member can acknowledge
  the write based on the :ref:`j <wc-j>` value:

  .. list-table::
     :stub-columns: 1
     :widths: 30 70

     * - ``j`` is unspecified
       - Acknowledgment depends on the value of
         :rsconf:`writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault`:

         - If ``true``, acknowledgment requires writing operation to 
           on-disk journal (``j: true``). 

           :rsconf:`writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault` defaults to 
           ``true`` 

         - If ``false``, acknowledgment requires writing operation in 
           memory (``j: false``).

     * - ``j: true``
       - Acknowledgment requires writing operation to on-disk journal.

     * - ``j: false``
       - Acknowledgment requires writing operation in memory.

  .. note::

     .. include:: /includes/extracts/no-journaling-rollback.rst

  .. note:: 

     :ref:`Hidden <replica-set-hidden-members>`,
     :ref:`delayed <replica-set-delayed-members>`,
     and :ref:`priority 0 <replica-set-secondary-only-members>`
     members with :rsconf:`members[n].votes` greater than ``0``
     can acknowledge :writeconcern:`"majority"` write operations.

     Delayed secondaries can return write acknowledgment no earlier
     than the configured :rsconf:`~members[n].slaveDelay`. 

``w: <number>``
  Any data-bearing member of the replica set can contribute
  to write acknowledgment of :ref:`w: \<number\> <wc-w>` write
  operations.
       
  The following table lists when the member can acknowledge
  the write based on the :ref:`j <wc-j>` value:

  .. list-table::
     :stub-columns: 1
     :widths: 30 70

     * - ``j`` is unspecified
       - Acknowledgment requires writing operation in memory 
         (``j: false``).

     * - ``j: true``
       - Acknowledgment requires writing operation to on-disk journal.

     * - ``j: false``
       - Acknowledgment requires writing operation in memory.

.. note:: 

   :ref:`Hidden <replica-set-hidden-members>`,
   :ref:`delayed <replica-set-delayed-members>`,
   and :ref:`priority 0 <replica-set-secondary-only-members>`
   members can acknowledge 
   :writeconcern:`w: \<number\> <\<number\>>` write operations.

   Delayed secondaries can return write acknowledgment no earlier
   than the configured :rsconf:`~members[n].slaveDelay`. 

Additional Information
----------------------

.. _calculating-majority-count:

Calculating Majority for Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tip::

   Starting in version 4.2.1, the :method:`rs.status()` returns the
   :data:`~replSetGetStatus.writeMajorityCount` field which contains
   the calculated majority number.

The majority for write concern :writeconcern:`"majority"` is calculated
as the smaller of the following values:

- the majority of *all* voting members (including arbiters) vs.

- the number of all **data-bearing** voting members.

.. warning::

   In cases where the calculated majority number is equal to the number
   of all **data-bearing** voting members (such as with a 3-member
   Primary-Secondary-Arbiter deployment), write concern
   :writeconcern:`"majority"` may time out or never be acknowledged if
   a data bearing voting member is down or unreachable. If possible,
   use a data-bearing voting member instead of an arbiter.

For example, consider:

- A replica set with 3 voting members, Primary-Secondary-Secondary
  (P-S-S):

  - The majority of all voting members is 2.

  - The number of all data-bearing voting members is 3.

  | The calculated majority is 2, the minimum of 2 and 3. The write
    must propagate to the primary and one of the secondaries to
    acknowledge the write concern :writeconcern:`"majority"` to the
    client.

- A replica set with 3 voting members, Primary-Secondary-Arbiter (P-S-A)
  
  - The majority of all voting members is 2.

  - The number of all data-bearing voting members is 2.

  | The calculated majority is 2, the minimum of 2 and 2. Since the
    write can only be applied to data-bearing members, the write must
    propagate to the primary and the secondary to acknowledge the write
    concern :writeconcern:`"majority"` to the client.

  .. tip::

     Avoid using a :writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern with a
     (P-S-A) or other topologies that require all data-bearing voting
     members to be available to acknowledge the writes. Customers who
     want the durability guarantees of using a
     :writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern should instead deploy a
     topology that does not require all data bearing voting members to be
     available (e.g. P-S-S).

Write Concern Provenance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 4.4, MongoDB tracks write concern ``provenance``,
which indicates the source of a particular write concern. You may see
``provenance`` shown in the
:serverstatus:`getLastError <metrics.getLastError>` metrics, write
concern error objects, and MongoDB logs.

The following table shows the possible write concern ``provenance``
values and their significance:

.. include:: /includes/fact-wc-provenance-table.rst
