|mms| generates a list of *host mappings* when you create or import a new
deployment for monitoring using information provided by each host. |mms|
regularly pings the monitored hosts and regenerates the entries on the
:guilabel:`Host Mappings` page after each ping. Mappings are displayed 
in rows with the preferred hostname on the left and an alias on the right.
A preferred hostname may have multiple aliases. Depending on the information |mms| 
obtains from a monitored host, an alias appears in one of the following forms:

* Fully qualified domain name (FQDN)

* Internal hostname

* External IP address

* Internal IP address

.. tip::

   If you specify a fully qualified domain name for a host when you create
   or import a new deployment for monitoring, |mms| will include the FQDN
   on the :guilabel:`Host Mappings` page even if the newly monitored host
   itself does not provide this information.

The preferred hostname also appears in the :guilabel:`Name` column of
the :guilabel:`Deployment` page. If you want a different preferred
hostname than chosen by |mms|, you can regenerate the list of mappings
in one of the following ways:

* Specify constraints on how |mms| picks a preferred hostname. See 
  :guilabel:`Preferred Hostnames` in :doc:`/tutorial/manage-project-settings`
  for more information.

* Reset the mapping list.  See :guilabel:`Reset Duplicates` in 
  :doc:`/tutorial/manage-project-settings`
  for more information.

.. important::

   Resetting duplicates and setting constraints on the selection of a
   preferred hostname cause |mms| to lose the monitoring history for
   affected hosts. Chart data based on this history is also lost.
