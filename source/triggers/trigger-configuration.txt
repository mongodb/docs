Database Trigger Configuration
------------------------------

Database triggers have the following configuration parameters:

.. cssclass:: auth-table
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 30

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Trigger Type`
     - The type of the trigger. Set to :guilabel:`Database` to make a
       Database trigger.

   * - :guilabel:`Name`
     - The name of the trigger.

   * - :guilabel:`Enabled`
     - Default: Enabled.
       A toggle that indicates whether or not the trigger is
       enabled. If enabled, the trigger will listen for events and
       execute its associated function when events cause it to fire.

   * - :guilabel:`Event Ordering`
     - Default: Enabled.
       Indicates whether event ordering is enabled for this trigger.

       If event ordering is enabled, multiple executions of this
       trigger will occur sequentially based on the timestamps of the
       change events. If event ordering is disabled, multiple
       executions of this trigger will occur independently.

       .. tip::

          Consider disabling event ordering if the trigger fires
          in response to periodic bursts of events.

          For example, suppose you have a daily batch job that inserts
          data to a collection and a database trigger that fires
          on inserts to that collection. Whenever the batch job runs,
          there will be a large number of trigger events to handle.

          Ordered triggers wait to execute a function for a particular
          event until the functions of previous events have finished
          executing. As a consequence, ordered triggers are effectively
          rate-limited by the run time of each sequential trigger
          function. This may cause a significant delay between the
          database event and the trigger firing if a sufficiently large
          number of trigger executions are queued.

          Unordered triggers execute functions in parallel if possible,
          which can be significantly faster (depending on your use
          case) but does not guarantee that multiple executions of a
          trigger function occur in event order.

   * - :guilabel:`Enabled Clusters`
     - The names of one or more MongoDB |service| clusters that the
       trigger function can access after an event causes it to fire. A
       trigger can interact with collections in a cluster if the
       cluster is listed in this field.

   * - :guilabel:`Select Linked Cluster`
     - The name of the MongoDB |service| cluster that the trigger
       applies to. The trigger listens for events in a collection
       within this cluster.

   * - :guilabel:`Database Name`
     - The MongoDB database that contains the watched collection.

   * - :guilabel:`Collection Name`
     - The name of the collection that the trigger watches for
       change events.

   * - :guilabel:`Operation Type`
     - One or more :ref:`database operation types
       <database-event-operation-types>` that cause the trigger to
       fire.

   * - :guilabel:`Full Document`
     - Default: Disabled. If enabled, indicates that ``UPDATE`` change
       events should include the most current
       :manual:`majority-committed </reference/read-concern-majority/>`
       version of the modified document in the ``fullDocument`` field.

       .. note::

          This option only affects ``UPDATE`` change events. ``INSERT``
          and ``REPLACE`` events always include the ``fullDocument``
          field. ``DELETE`` events never include the ``fullDocument``
          field. For more information, see the :manual:`change events
          </reference/change-events/>` reference page.

       .. warning::

          Update operations executed from MongoDB Compass or the
          MongoDB |service| Data Explorer fully replace the previous
          document. As a result, update operations from these clients
          will generate ``REPLACE`` change events rather than
          ``UPDATE`` events.

   * - :guilabel:`Function`
     - A :realm:`{+MongoDB-Realm+} Function </functions>`, written in
       JavaScript, that the trigger executes whenever it fires. The
       trigger passes the
       :ref:`database event object <database-events>`
       that caused it to fire as the only argument to this function.

       This Function exists in a shared :realm:`{+MongoDB-Realm+} </>`
       app called :guilabel:`Triggers_{+Realm+}App`, which |service|
       automatically creates for you.

       .. seealso::

          :ref:`{+MongoDB-Realm+} Functions Provide Server-side Logic <server-side-logic>`

       .. admonition:: AWS EventBridge
          :class: note

          You can configure a trigger to send an event to AWS
          EventBridge rather than call a function.

          .. seealso::

             :doc:`Send Trigger Events to AWS EventBridge </triggers/eventbridge>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Match Expression`
     - Default: ``{}`` i.e. "Match All". A :pipeline:`$match`
       expression document that is prepended to the beginning of the
       trigger's underlying change stream aggregation pipeline. All
       change event objects for the trigger are evaluated against this
       match expression and the trigger will not fire unless the
       expression evaluates to ``true`` for a given change event. This
       is useful when you want to filter change events using data other
       than their operation type.

       .. example::

          The following :guilabel:`Match Expression` document prevents
          the trigger from firing unless the document's ``status``
          field was updated to have a value of ``"blocked"``:

          .. code-block:: javascript

             {
               "updateDescription.updatedFields": {
                 "status": "blocked"
               }
             }

.. _database-events:

Database Change Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _database-event-operation-types:

Database change events represent individual changes in a specific
collection of a MongoDB cluster.

Every database event has the same operation type and structure as the
:manual:`change event </reference/change-events/>` object that was
emitted by the underlying change stream. Change events have the
following operation types:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 30

   * - Operation Type
     - Represents

   * - ``INSERT``
     - A new document that was added to the collection.

   * - ``UPDATE``
     - A change to an existing document in the collection.

   * - ``REPLACE``
     - A new document that replaced a document in the collection.

   * - ``DELETE``
     - A document that was deleted from the collection.

Database change event objects have the following general form:

.. code-block:: json

   {
      _id : <ObjectId>,
      "operationType": <string>,
      "fullDocument": <document>,
      "ns": {
         "db" : <string>,
         "coll" : <string>
      },
      "documentKey": {
        "_id": <ObjectId>
      },
      "updateDescription": <document>,
      "clusterTime": <Timestamp>
   }

.. seealso::

   :manual:`change events </reference/change-events/>` for detailed
   descriptions of these fields.


.. _scheduled-trigger-configuration:

Scheduled Trigger Configuration
-------------------------------

Scheduled triggers have the following configuration parameters:

.. cssclass:: auth-table
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 30

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Trigger Type`
     - The type of the trigger. Set to :guilabel:`Scheduled` to make a
       Scheduled trigger.

   * - :guilabel:`Name`
     - The name of the trigger.

   * - :guilabel:`Enabled`
     - Default: Enabled.
       A toggle that indicates whether or not the trigger is
       enabled. If enabled, the trigger will execute its associated
       function on schedule.

   * - :guilabel:`Schedule Type`
     - Default: Basic.
       The schedule on which to run the trigger.

       In :guilabel:`Basic` mode, drop-downs control the trigger
       frequency. You can set the trigger to repeat by minutes, by
       hours, on a specific day of the week, or on a specific day of
       the month. The :guilabel:`Next Events` box shows a preview of
       when the trigger will run according to the dropdown settings.

       In :guilabel:`Advanced` mode, a :doc:`CRON expression </triggers/cron-expressions>`
       determines when to fire the trigger. The :guilabel:`Next Events`
       box shows a preview of when the trigger will run according
       to the CRON expression.

   * - :guilabel:`Enabled Clusters`
     - The names of one or more MongoDB |service| clusters that the
       trigger function can access after an event causes it to fire. A
       trigger can interact with collections in a cluster if the
       cluster is listed in this field.

   * - :guilabel:`Function`
     - A :realm:`{+MongoDB-Realm+} Function </functions>`, written in
       JavaScript, that the trigger executes whenever it fires. This
       Function exists in a shared :realm:`{+MongoDB-Realm+} </>` app
       called :guilabel:`Triggers_{+Realm+}App`, which |service|
       automatically creates for you.
