Set up Your Project
-------------------

Use Go Mod to Initialize a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a new directory and initialize your project by using ``go mod``.

.. code-block:: shell

   mkdir go-quickstart
   cd go-quickstart
   go mod init go-quickstart

.. _golang-add-mongodb-dependency:

Add MongoDB as a Dependency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``go get`` to add the Go driver as a dependency.

.. code-block:: shell

   go get go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo

Add Other Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``go get`` to add any additional dependencies. This Quick Start
uses the ``godotenv`` package to read a MongoDB connection string
from an environment variable to avoid embedding credentials within
source code.

.. code-block:: shell

   go get github.com/joho/godotenv

Create a MongoDB Cluster
------------------------

.. include:: /includes/quick-start/atlas-setup.rst


Query Your MongoDB Cluster from Your Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, create a file to contain your application called ``main.go``
in the base directory of your project. Use the following sample
code to run a query on your sample dataset in MongoDB Atlas.

Specify your MongoDB Atlas connection string as the value of the
``uri`` variable, or create an environment variable called
``MONGODB_URI`` and set your Atlas connection string as its value.

.. code-block:: bash

   export MONGODB_URI='<your atlas connection string>'

.. note::

   Make sure to replace the "<password>" section of the connection string with
   the password you created for your user that has **atlasAdmin** permissions.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/quick-start/main.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:

Run the sample code with the following command from your command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   go run main.go

.. include:: /includes/quick-start/query-output.rst

.. tip::

   If your output is empty, ensure you have loaded the
   :atlas:`sample datasets </sample-data/>` into your cluster.

After completing this step, you should have a working application that uses
the Go driver to connect to your MongoDB cluster, run a query on the
sample data, and print out the result.
