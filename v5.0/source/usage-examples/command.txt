=============
Run a Command
=============

You can run all raw database operations using the
``MongoDatabase.runCommand()`` method. A raw database operation is a
command you can execute directly on the MongoDB server CLI. These
commands include administrative and diagnostic tasks, such as fetching
server stats or initializing a replica set. Call the ``runCommand()``
method with a ``Bson`` command object on an instance of a ``MongoDatabase``
to run your raw database operation.

.. tip::

    Use the :mongosh:`MongoDB Shell </>` for
    administrative tasks instead of the Kotlin driver whenever possible,
    since these tasks are often quicker and easier to implement with the
    shell than in a Kotlin application.

The ``runCommand()`` method accepts a command in the form of a ``Bson`` object.
By default, ``runCommand`` returns an object of type
``org.bson.Document`` containing the output of the database command. You
can specify a return type for ``runCommand()`` as an optional second
parameter.

Example
-------

In the following sample code, we send the ``dbStats`` command to request
statistics from a specific MongoDB database.

.. include:: /includes/connect-guide-note.rst

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/Command.snippet.command-usage-example.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false
