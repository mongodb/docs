MongoDB supports the following authentication mechanisms:

- :doc:`SCRAM Authentication </core/security-scram>` (*Default*)

- :doc:`x.509 Certificate Authentication </core/security-x.509>`.

In addition, MongoDB Enterprise provides integration with a number of
external authentication mechanisms, including Kerberos and LDAP. See
:doc:`/core/authentication-mechanisms-enterprise` for the additional
authentication mechanisms supported by MongoDB Enterprise.

SCRAM Authentication
--------------------

Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) is the
default authentication mechanism for MongoDB.

For more information on SCRAM and MongoDB, see:

- :doc:`SCRAM Authentication </core/security-scram>`
- :ref:`scram-client-authentication`

.. _authentication-mechanism-x509:

x.509 Certificate Authentication
--------------------------------

MongoDB supports x.509 certificate authentication for client
authentication and internal authentication of the members of replica
sets and sharded clusters. x.509 certificate authentication requires a
secure :doc:`TLS/SSL connection </tutorial/configure-ssl>`.

To use MongoDB with x.509, you must use valid certificates generated and
signed by a certificate authority. The client x.509 certificates
must meet the :ref:`client certificate requirements
<client-x509-certificates-requirements>`.

For more information on x.509 and MongoDB, see:

- :doc:`x.509 Certificate Authentication </core/security-x.509>`
- :ref:`x509-client-authentication`
