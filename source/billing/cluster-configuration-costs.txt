Cloud Service Provider and Region
---------------------------------

|service| supports deploying clusters onto :ref:`Amazon Web Services
<amazon-aws>`, the :ref:`Google Cloud Platform <google-gcp>`, and
:ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>`. The choice of cloud service
provider and region or regions for the |service| project affects the
cost of running a |service| cluster.

Multi-region cluster costs depend on the number of and location of
additional regions selected. When creating a cluster, |service|
displays the :ref:`cluster tier cost <instance-size-costs>` based on
only the :guilabel:`Preferred Region` of the cluster. You can see the
total cost of running the cluster in the :guilabel:`Cluster Overview`.

To learn more about configuring your cloud provider and region, see
:ref:`Cloud Providers and Regions <create-cluster-cloud-provider-region>`.

.. _instance-size-costs:

Cluster Tier
-------------

|service| provides different :ref:`cluster tiers <create-cluster-instance>`.
Each cluster tier has a default RAM capacity, storage capacity, and
maximum storage speed. The cluster's per-hour charge includes these
default values. |service| uses the selected cluster when deploying all
the data-bearing [#data-bearing]_ servers in your cluster.

Depending on the choice of cloud service provider, |service| provides
customization options for :ref:`cluster storage capacity <storage-capacity>`
and the :ref:`speed <instance-storage-speed>` of that storage. If you
add capacity or speed, you incur additional costs on top of the base
cost. For multi-region clusters, the per-cluster cost, including any
selected customizations, is relative to the
:guilabel:`Preferred Region`. The :guilabel:`Cluster Overview` box
shows your overall charges.

.. _storage-capacity:
.. _instance-storage-capacity:

Storage Capacity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| charges for :ref:`storage capacity <create-cluster-storage>`
differently depending on whether you use the cluster default or specify
a custom storage capacity.

- If you use the default storage capacity, |service| includes its cost
  in the cluster's per-hour cost.

- If you customize the amount of storage capacity, |service| charges
  for the full amount of storage. |service| doesn't deduct the cost of
  the default storage capacity.

.. example::

   A new ``M10`` cluster defaults to 10 GB of storage. You can increase
   this amount up to 120 GB of storage using this cluster tier.

   If you increase the storage capacity to 50 GB, your monthly
   |service| cost includes 50 GB of storage, not the cost of the
   additional 40 GB.

.. note::

   Increasing storage capacity can change the maximum |iops| available
   with each :guilabel:`Custom Storage Speed`.

.. _storage-speed:
.. _instance-storage-speed:

Custom Storage Speed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| measures storage speed as maximum |iops|. Each |service|
:ref:`cluster tier<instance-size-costs>` offers a default storage
speed that is included in the cluster's per-hour cost. The choice of
cloud service provider and cluster affects the available storage
speed customization options, as well as the cost of selecting a custom
storage speed.

.. tabs-cloud-providers::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: azure

      All clusters use premium |ssd| disks with fixed maximum |iops|
      based on the storage capacity. The maximum |iops| increases as
      storage capacity increases. The cost of the increased maximum
      |iops| is included in the cost of the increased storage capacity.
      To learn more about the Azure Premium disks, see
      :azure:`High-performance Premium Storage and managed disks for VMs </storage/storage-premium-storage>`.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: aws

      For most cluster types, you can increase storage speed from
      :guilabel:`Standard` to :guilabel:`Fast` or :guilabel:`Fastest`,
      which affects costs. Selecting a custom speed changes both |iops|
      and the type of storage used. The storage type changes from a
      general-purpose |ssd| to a provisioned-|iops| |ssd|.
      To learn more about storage types, see
      :aws:`Amazon EBS Volume Types </AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html>`.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: gcp

      All clusters use |ssd| persistent disks with fixed maximum |iops|
      based on the cluster storage capacity. The maximum |iops|
      increases as storage capacity increases. The cost of the
      increased maximum |iops| is included in the cost of the increased
      storage capacity. To learn more about the |gcp| persistent disks,
      see :gcp:`Persistent Disks </compute/docs/disks/#pdspecs>`.

Cluster Auto-Scaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To help minimize cluster costs while retaining the flexibility to
easily scale your cluster, you can enable
:ref:`Cluster Auto-Scaling <cluster-autoscaling>`. With auto-scaling,
your cluster automatically scales its tier, storage capacity, or both
in response to cluster usage. Auto-scaling reduces the need to
manually optimize your cluster to adapt to your current workload.

Backup
------

The |service| :doc:`../backup-restore-cluster` supports
:doc:`/backup/legacy-backup/overview` and
:doc:`/backup/cloud-backup/overview`. Each backup method has
its own cost calculations and considerations.

|service| charges for each replica set in a cluster.

- For a replica set deployment, the backup costs are the cost to backup
  data for the replica set.

- For a sharded cluster deployment, |service| sums the cost to backup
  the data for each shard replica set *and* the config server replica
  set.

|service| charges for the network transfer costs of restoring a
snapshot. To learn how |service| charges for network data, see
:ref:`data-transfer-costs`.

.. _billing-backup-legacy-snapshots:

{+Old-Backup+}s
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The backup cost for {+old-backup+}s is per GB per month
(US$2.50 / GB / month) as specified on the |service-pricing|. The
monthly rate is annualized and then divided by 365 to arrive at a Daily
Backup Rate per GB. The first 1 GB of backup data is free.

Monthly backup costs are primarily based on the size per-gigabyte of
the data to back up. This size is roughly equivalent to the
uncompressed size of all documents and all indexes for all the
databases backed up.

To retrieve the size in gigabyte of the documents and indexes for a
given database, you can issue the
:manual:`db.stats() </reference/method/db.stats>` method and sum the
``dataSize`` and ``indexSize`` fields.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.stats(1024*1024*1024).dataSize + db.stats(1024*1024*1024).indexSize

The rate is based on your having 28 snapshots at steady state:

- The six-hour snapshots are kept for two days;

- The daily snapshots for one week,

- The weekly snapshots for one month,

- The monthly for one year.

Adding that up, you get 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 snapshots. We adjust the
backup rate daily based on the following formula:

.. code-block:: none

   backupRatePerMonth = $1.25 + snapshotAtSteadyState/28 × $1.25

Changing the snapshot frequency or retention period affects the base
rate per GB. See :ref:`modify-backup-schedule` for more information.

.. example::

   - For a three-member replica set with 30GB of data, |service|
     charges US$72.50 each month (using the default backup rate).

     ``(30 GB - 1 GB) × US$2.50 = US$72.50``

   - A sharded cluster with 3 shards contains 90GB of data, with each
     shard containing 30GB of data each. The config server replica set
     contains 5GB of data.

     For this sharded cluster, |service| charges US$227.50 per month
     (using the default backup rate).

     ``((30 GB - 1 GB) × US$2.50) × 3) + ((5 GB - 1 GB) × US$2.50) =
     US$227.50``

.. _billing-backup-cloud-provider-snapshots:

{+Cloud-Backup+}s
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   If you enabled {+PIT-Restore+}s, |service| bills you using the rates
   given for :ref:`billing-backup-cps-pit`.

|service| computes the cost for {+Cloud-Backup+}s based on the *total*
size of all snapshots in GB per month.

{+Cloud-Backup+}s support incremental snapshots, where a new
snapshot saves only the data that changed after your most recent
snapshot.

.. example::

   A cluster with 10 GB of data and 3 snapshots may require less
   than 30 GB of total snapshot storage depending on how data
   changed between snapshots.

         * - Multi-Region

             |service| selects the lowest priority cluster node in the
             highest priority region to execute and store snapshots.

      .. example::

         For a three member replica set deployed to the Azure
         ``useast2`` region (Virginia, USA) with three snapshots of
         10, 20, and 30 GB respectively, |service| charges US$20.40.

         ``(10 GB × US$0.34) + (20 GB × US$0.34) + (30 GB × US$0.34)``

         .. note::

            The US$0.34 rate per GB is specific to the
            :ref:`Azure <microsoft-azure>` ``useast2`` region at the
            time of writing. |service| displays the most current
            cost per GB for the cluster's selected region during
            cluster configuration.

             |service| selects the lowest priority cluster node in the
             highest priority region to execute and store snapshots.

If the existing snapshot storage volume becomes invalid, |service|
creates a new snapshot storage volume in the same region as the
cluster's current backup node and takes a full-copy snapshot. |service|
continues using that backup node and its cloud provider region for
snapshots and snapshot storage. This may result in a higher invoice for
the few days required to re-establish incremental snapshots.

   To learn more about how |service| manages snapshot storage, see
   :ref:`backup-cloud-provider`.

When restoring a cluster using a manual download via |https|, |service|
also charges for each hour that the download link remains active. To
contact MongoDB Support for more information, click :guilabel:`Support`

.. _billing-backup-cps-pit:

{+PIT-Restore+}s
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cluster owners may enable :ref:`{+PIT-Restore+} restores <pit-restore>`
from {+Cloud-Backup+}s. |pit| backups are billed based on the disk
space occupied by the cluster's :term:`oplog` combined with the
{+cloud-backup+} backup size.

|service| calculates backup pricing based on the region where it stores
the snapshot and the amount of storage used:

         snapshot and oplog size of 115 GB. The first 5 GB are free.
         The remaining 110 GB are billed at:

         (95 × $2.35) + (15 × $1.75) = $249.50

   .. tab::
      :tabid: aws

      .. include:: /includes/list-tables/backup-pricing/aws.rst

      .. example::

         A cluster in the ``US_EAST_1`` regionhas a combined total
         snapshot and oplog size of 115 GB. The first 5 GB are free.
         The remaining 110 GB are billed at:

         (95 × $1.00) + (15 × $0.75) = $106.25

         The remaining 110 GB are billed at:

         (95 × $0.60) + (15 × $0.45) = $63.75

|pit| backups may be :ref:`configured <create-cluster-backups>` to
cover a window of time specified by the user. Longer backup windows
result in larger oplogs and higher backup costs.

Lowering the Monthly Rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`legacy-backup`
````````````````````````

Lowering snapshot frequency or lowering snapshot retention lowers the
cost per gigabyte. Increasing the snapshot frequency or the snapshot
retention increases the cost per gigabyte. To modify the snapshot
frequency or retention for a cluster, see
:ref:`modify-backup-schedule`.

:ref:`backup-cloud-provider`
````````````````````````````

The cost of backups is dependent on the region of the replica set
member targeted for snapshots. Modifying the region configuration for
your cluster may reduce the cost per gigabyte for snapshot storage.
To change regions, see
:ref:`scaling the cluster <scale-cluster-region>`.

|bic|
-----

Excluding |service-fullname| Enterprise and |service-fullname| Platinum
customers, if |bic| is enabled for your cluster:

- The billing rate for the |bic| is described in the cluster console
  as a daily uplift on the cost of the associated cluster. You can
  view the rate when :ref:`deploying your cluster <create-new-cluster>`
  or by :doc:`modifying your cluster </scale-cluster>`.

- |bic| has a sustained-usage pricing. That is, the daily rate is
  charged only up to a maximum for the month.

.. _server-number-costs:

Number of Nodes
---------------

|service| charges the cluster cost and data storage cost for each
data-bearing node [#data-bearing]_ in your cluster.

- For a replica set, the number of data-bearing nodes equals the
  replication factor.

- For a sharded cluster, the number of data-bearing nodes equals the
  replication factor multiplied by the number of shards.

If you enable sharding, |service| also runs three
:ref:`config servers <sharding-config-server>` in addition to your
data-bearing nodes. Your selections for cluster tier and data
storage do not affect the costs of the config nodes. Config servers
are charged at a separate rate. Their cost is reflected in the cost of
the cluster.
