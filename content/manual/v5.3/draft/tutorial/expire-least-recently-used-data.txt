=================================================
Expire Least Recently Used Data from a Collection
=================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Least recently used, or LRU, data retention patterns are used in simple
data caches or support for stateless systems. By extending TTL
collections with application support provides additional features.

This pattern presents some cases and provides a pattern for maintaining
documents in MongoDB where LRU documents are retained while others are
removed using the TTL collection feature.

Use Case
--------

- Online shopping cart

  A database can be used to track shoppers' carts and items while
  they're on the site. If there are any abandoned carts, the database
  will clean them up and can make items available to shoppers again.

- Authentication sessions

  An mobile app stores session information in a database, and
  validates current users' session when servicing requests.

- Rendered page cache

  Assemble pages from database content and store rendered pages in a
  collection. The page should be stored as long as the page is being
  requested.

- Draft comment 

  Draft web comments are saved on the server temporarily until the
  visitor submits it. If the visitor does not submit, then the comment
  will be cleared from the server.

- Transcoded media cache

  Archival images and videos are stored in a high quality format and
  transcoded to device specific formats for distribution. Keeping
  lists of frequently accessed media in cache and transcoding archive
  materials on demand can provide excellent application response while
  maximizing resources.
  
Solution
--------

Use a MongoDB TTL collection with your application to create a Least
Recently Used collection. Your application updates current items while
MongoDB automatically remove expired items.

Requirements:

- MongoDB version 2.2 or greater.
- Application to connect to MongoDB.

Process:

#. Collection setup.
#. Set up a MongodB TTL collection.
#. Set up a application to insert, access, and update MongoDB
   collection.

Pattern
-------

For an online shopping cart, MongoDB will track the shoppers' items in
the ``carts`` collection for a limited time.

The store application needs to update the collection when:

- the shopper accesses the site, 
- adds or removes items, or 
- checks out.

If the shopper leaves the site, their cart will be available for a
limited time, eventually, the cart will be removed.

Collection setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``carts`` collection may be the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : ObjectId("..."), 
     "cartID" : 100, 
     "lastChange" : ISODate("2012-08-02T17:47:15.275Z"),
     "products": [ soap, sugar, milk ] }

   { "_id" : ObjectId("..."), 
     "cartID" : 101,
     "lastChange" : ISODate("2012-08-02T17:47:15.275Z"),
     "products": [ milk, bread, eggs ] }

   { "_id" : ObjectId("..."), 
     "cartID" : 102,
     "lastChange" : ISODate("2012-08-02T17:47:15.275Z"),
     "products": [ sugar, flour, eggs ] }

The ``carts`` collection can be created by using the following commands:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.carts.insert( { cartID: 100, lastChange: new ISODate(), products: [ "soap", "sugar", "milk" ] })
   db.carts.insert( { cartID: 101, lastChange: new ISODate(), products: [ "milk", "bread", "eggs" ] } ) 
   db.carts.insert( { cartID: 102, lastChange: new ISODate(), products: [ "sugar", "flour", "eggs" ] } )

Set up a TTL collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following command will set :program:`mongod` to monitor the
``lastChange`` field and delete any documents that are older than
86,400 seconds or 24 hours:
 
.. code-block:: javascript

   db.carts.ensureIndex( { lastChange: 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 86400 } )

Application response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To keep any documents in the collection, update the ``lastChange``
field with a newer date. The following command will update the time of
``lastChange`` of cart ``101`` and add an item to the ``products`` list.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.carts.update( { cartID: 101 }, { $set: { lastChange: new ISODate(), products: [ "milk", "bread", "eggs", "banana" ] } } )

Overall result
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any documents in a TTL collection that is updated properly will remain
in the collection, while others will be deleted by
:program:`mongod`. Your application will only have to perform simple
updates to individual documents.

With basic application updates, any TTL collection can easily become a
Least Recently Used collection.
