About {+adf+}
---------------------------

{+adf+} is a distributed query engine that allows you to natively 
query, transform, and move data across various sources inside & outside 
of |service-fullname|. 

Key Concepts 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. expression:: Federated Database Instance 

   A {+fdi+} is a deployment of {+adf+}. Each {+fdi+} contains virtual 
   databases and collections that map to data in your data stores.

.. expression:: Data Store 

   Data store refers to the location of your data. {+adf+} supports the 
   following data stores: 

   - |service| {+cluster+} 
   - |service| :ref:`online archive <online-archive-overview>`
   - |aws| |s3| buckets 
   -  {+az-bs+}
   - {+gcp+} Storage
   - |http| and |https| endpoints

.. expression:: Storage Configuration 

   Storage configuration contains mappings between your virtual 
   databases and collections and data sources in |json| format. You can 
   define these mappings in the storage configuration to access and run 
   queries against your data.

{+adf+} Architecture 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :figwidth: 700px

The **Data Plane** in the preceding diagram is where your data
resides.  You can configure {+adf+} to access data in a variety of
storage services. Specifically, you can configure {+adf+} to access
data in your |aws| |s3| buckets across |aws| regions, {+az-bs+}
containers, {+gcp+} Storage buckets, |service| {+clusters}+, |http| and
|https| |url|\s, and |service| {+Online-Archive+}s. To learn more
about configuring {+adf+} to access your data stores, see
:ref:`config-adf`.

You can then set up role-based access control for your {+fdi+}\s. You
can control how your client connects to your {+fdi+}, either through a
global connection option or by pinning it to a specific region. To learn
more, see :ref:`config-connection`. 

{+adf+} preserves data locality and maximizes local computation, where
possible, to minimize data transfer and optimize performance. The
**Compute Plane** in the preceding diagram shows where {+adf+} processes
all requests. {+adf+} provides an elastic pool of agents in the region
that is nearest to your data where {+adf+} can process the data for 
your queries. To learn more about supported regions, see
:ref:`atlas-data-federation-regions`. 

{+adf+} doesn't persist data inside the system and once your query is
processed, it only stores the metadata in your {+fdi+}. This allows you
to comply with *data sovereignty* regulations and ensures that your data
is stored and processed in compliance with legal requirements. 

The **Control Plane** in the preceding diagram, which is the same as the
|service| Control Plane, is where {+adf+} balances user requests and
aggregates final results. 

{+adf+} executes certain parts of a query directly on the underlying
storage service, rather than transfer all of the data to the compute
nodes for processing. Additionally, when you execute a query, it is
first processed by a {+df+} front-end component, which plans the query
and then distributes it to the nodes in the backend. The backend nodes
then access your data store directly to execute the query logic and
return the results back to the front-end. This process reduces the
amount of data to move around, thereby making the whole process faster
and cheaper. To learn more, see :ref:`query-fdi`.  

To optimize the performance of your queries, {+adf+} does the following: 

- For Cloud Object Storage, it uses data partitioning to select the
  files that it needs to process based on query parameters. To learn
  more, see :ref:`adf-path-syntax` and
  :ref:`adf-path-attribute-types`. Additionally, it uses Parquet
  metadata to reduce the amount of data it scans from parquet files
  using row group selection or column projection. To learn more, see
  :ref:`Parquet Data Format <adf-parquet-data>`. 
- For |service| {+clusters+}, it tries to "push down" as much of the query
  to the {+cluster+} as possible. For example, if your aggregation pipeline
  has a :pipeline:`$match` stage and if it can be processed locally, 
  {+adf+} tries to process that stage in the |service| {+cluster+} and only
  returns the resulting documents back to the federated layer for
  processing subsequent stages. To learn more, see :ref:`query-atlas`.

To learn more, see :ref:`optimize-query-perf`.

You can connect to {+adf+} using MongoDB language-specific
:driver:`drivers </>`, {+mongosh+}, and :ref:`Atlas SQL
<query-with-sql>`. To learn more, see :ref:`gst-connect-adf`.

Sample Uses 
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use {+adf+} to: 

- Copy |service| {+cluster+} data into Parquet or |csv| files written to 
  |aws| |s3| buckets. 
- Query across multiple |service| {+clusters+} and online archives to get a
  holistic view of your |service| data.
- Materialize data from aggregations across |service| {+clusters+} and |aws|
  |s3| buckets.
- Read and import data from your |aws| |s3| buckets into an |service| 
  cluster.

{+adf+} Regions 
-----------------------------

.. note::

   To prevent excessive charges on your bill, create your {+adf+} in 
   the same |aws| or |azure| region as your |s3| or {+az-bs+} data
   source. You can query |aws| |s3| only using {+fdi+}\s created in
   |aws| and you can query {+az-bs+} only using {+fdi+}\s created in
   |azure|. 

{+adf+} routes your federated database requests through one of the 
following regions:

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: AWS 
      :tabid: aws

      .. include:: /includes/list-table-adf-supported-aws-regions.rst

   .. tab:: Azure 
      :tabid: azure

      .. include:: /includes/list-table-adf-supported-azure-regions.rst

   .. tab:: GCP
      :tabid: gcp

      .. include:: /includes/list-table-adf-supported-gcp-regions.rst

.. note::

   You will incur charges when running federated queries. For more 
   information, see :ref:`atlas-data-federation-billing`.
