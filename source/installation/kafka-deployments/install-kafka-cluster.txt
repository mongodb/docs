You can install {+rel-mig+} on an existing self-managed Kafka cluster 
including Kafka Connect. This installation method is ideal if you are already 
running Kafka or you have your own approach to installing and configuring Kafka.

.. important::

   This guide assumes familiarity with Kafka. This documentation and MongoDB 
   Support does not provide support for setting up, configuring, or managing 
   a Kafka cluster.


Before you Begin 
----------------

You must have Kafka and network connectivity to the Kafka Connect cluster 
from the computer running {+rel-mig+}.

Steps

   :style: normal

   .. step:: Install Debezium Source Connect Plugin

      a. Download the source connector archive for your source database:

         - `MySQL Connector plugin archive 
           <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/debezium/debezium-connector-mysql/{+connector-version+}.Final/debezium-connector-mysql-{+connector-version+}.Final-plugin.tar.gz>`__
         - `Postgres Connector plugin archive 
           <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/debezium/debezium-connector-postgres/{+connector-version+}.Final/debezium-connector-postgres-{+connector-version+}.Final-plugin.tar.gz>`__
         - `SQL Server Connector plugin archive 
           <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/debezium/debezium-connector-sqlserver/{+connector-version+}.Final/debezium-connector-sqlserver-{+connector-version+}.Final-plugin.tar.gz>`__ 
         - `Oracle Connector plugin archive 
           <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/debezium/debezium-connector-oracle/{+connector-version+}.Final/debezium-connector-oracle-{+connector-version+}.Final-plugin.tar.gz>`__  

      b. Unzip the archive.

      c. Copy the ``debezium-connector.jar`` file to the ``debezium-connector`` directory.

         From the downloaded archive, copy the ``debezium-connector.jar`` file to the
         ``debezium-connector-xxx`` directory at Kafka Connect’s `plugin.path 
         <https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connectconfigs_plugin.path>`__ on your 
         Kafka Connect cluster. For example: ``/kafka/connect/debezium-connector-sqlserver``.

      d. Restart your Kafka Connect cluster.

         When the  plugin is successfully registered, the following log statement 
         appears in the ``kafka-connect`` start up logs:

         .. code-block::
            :copyable: false

            INFO || Added plugin 'io.debezium.connector.sqlserver.SqlServerConnector'

   .. step:: Install the {+rel-mig+} Sink Connect Plugin

      a. Download the latest version of the ``kafka-connect-migrator.jar`` file.

         To download the latest ``kafka-connect-migrator.jar`` file, see the `Migrator Installer 
         Repository <https://migrator-installer-repository.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/index.html>`__.

      b. Copy the ``.jar`` file to the ``kafka-connect-migrator`` directory.

         The new ``kafka-connect-migrator`` directory is found at Kafka Connect’s `plugin.path 
         <https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connectconfigs_plugin.path>`__. For example: 
         ``/kafka/connect/kafka-connect-migrator``. 

      c. Restart your Kafka Connect cluster. 

         When the  plugin is successfully registered, the following log statement 
         appears in the ``kafka-connect`` start up logs:

         .. code-block::
            :copyable: false

            INFO || Added plugin 'com.mongodb.migrator.kafka.connect.MigratorSinkConnector'

   .. step:: Install {+rel-mig+}

      From the `download center <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/relational-migrator>`__, 
      select the latest version of the {+rel-mig+} installer.

   .. step:: Run {+rel-mig+} in kafka-integrated mode

      To run in ``kafka-integrated`` mode, update the following configurations in your 
      ``user.properties`` file.

      Your ``user.properties`` file is located in an OS specific location. For more 
      information, see :ref:`{+rel-mig+} File Locations <file-location>`.

      .. include:: /includes/kafka-cluster-properties.rst
      
      For more information about the ``user.properties`` file, see :ref:`<rm-user-properties>`.

   .. step:: Confirm successful installation

      Start {+rel-mig+} and check the logs. Confirm that the Kafka profile 
      is active and that there are no errors.

      Your ``log`` file is located in an OS specific location. For more 
      information, see :ref:`{+rel-mig+} File Locations <file-location>`.
