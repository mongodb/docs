.. dbcommand:: count

   Counts the number of documents in a collection or a view. Returns a
   document that contains this count and as well as the command status.

   .. note::

      MongoDB drivers compatible with the 4.0 features deprecate their
      respective cursor and collection ``count()`` APIs (which runs the
      :dbcommand:`count` command) in favor of new APIs that corresponds to
      ``countDocuments()`` and ``estimatedDocumentCount()``. For the
      specific API names for a given driver, see the driver API
      documentation.

   :dbcommand:`count` has the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        count: <collection or view>,
        query: <document>,
        limit: <integer>,
        skip: <integer>,
        hint: <hint>,
        readConcern: <document>,
        collation: <document>
      }

   :dbcommand:`count` has the following fields:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/dbcommand-count-field.rst

   The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell also provides the following wrapper methods for :dbcommand:`count`:
   
   - :method:`~cursor.count()`
   - :method:`db.collection.estimatedDocumentCount()`
   - :method:`db.collection.count()`

   .. important::

      - Avoid using the :dbcommand:`count` and its wrapper methods
        without a query predicate (note:
        :method:`db.collection.estimatedDocumentCount()` does not take
        a query predicate) since without the query predicate, these
        operations return results based on the collection's metadata,
        which may result in an approximate count. In particular,

        - On a sharded cluster, the resulting count will not correctly
          filter out :term:`orphaned documents <orphaned document>`.

        - :ref:`After an unclean shutdown <count-accuracy-shutdown>`,
          the count may be incorrect.

      - For counts based on collection metadata, see also 
        :ref:`collStats pipeline stage with the count <collstat-count>`
        option.

Behavior
--------

Count and Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot use :dbcommand:`count` and shell helpers
:method:`~cursor.count()` and :method:`db.collection.count()` in
:ref:`transactions <transactions-ops-count>`.

For details, see :ref:`Transactions and Count Operations
<transactions-ops-count>`.

Accuracy and Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-count-on-sharded-clusters-cmd-count.rst

.. _count-accuracy-shutdown:

Accuracy after Unexpected Shutdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |cmd| replace:: :dbcommand:`count`
.. |opt| replace:: count

.. include:: /includes/fact-unexpected-shutdown-accuracy.rst

.. note:: 
   This loss of accuracy only applies to :dbcommand:`count`
   operations that do *not* include a query document.

Examples
--------

The following sections provide examples of the :dbcommand:`count`
command.

Count All Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation counts the number of all documents in the
``orders`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { count: 'orders' } )

In the result, the ``n``, which represents the count, is ``26``,
and the command status ``ok`` is ``1``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "n" : 26, "ok" : 1 }

Count Documents That Match a Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation returns a count of the documents in the
``orders`` collection where the value of the ``ord_dt`` field is
greater than ``Date('01/01/2012')``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { count:'orders',
                    query: { ord_dt: { $gt: new Date('01/01/2012') } }
                  } )

In the result, the ``n``, which represents the count, is ``13``
and the command status ``ok`` is ``1``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "n" : 13, "ok" : 1 }

Skip Documents in Count
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation returns a count of the documents in the
``orders`` collection where the value of the ``ord_dt`` field is
greater than ``Date('01/01/2012')`` and skip the first ``10`` matching
documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { count:'orders',
                    query: { ord_dt: { $gt: new Date('01/01/2012') } },
                    skip: 10 }  )

In the result, the ``n``, which represents the count, is ``3`` and
the command status ``ok`` is ``1``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "n" : 3, "ok" : 1 }

Specify the Index to Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation uses the index ``{ status: 1 }`` to return a
count of the documents in the ``orders`` collection where the value of
the ``ord_dt`` field is greater than ``Date('01/01/2012')`` and the
``status`` field is equal to ``"D"``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
        count:'orders',
        query: {
                 ord_dt: { $gt: new Date('01/01/2012') },
                 status: "D"
               },
        hint: { status: 1 }
      }
   )

In the result, the ``n``, which represents the count, is ``1`` and
the command status ``ok`` is ``1``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "n" : 1, "ok" : 1 }
   
Override Default Read Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To override the default read concern level of :readconcern:`"local"`,
use the ``readConcern`` option.

The following operation on a replica set specifies a
:doc:`/reference/read-concern` of :readconcern:`"majority"` to read the
most recent copy of the data confirmed as having been written to a
majority of the nodes.

.. important::

   - .. include:: /includes/fact-enable-majority-readConcern.rst

   - To use the ``readConcern`` level of ``"majority"``, you must specify
     a nonempty ``query`` condition.

   - .. include:: /includes/fact-readConcern-most-recent-data-in-node.rst

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
        count: "restaurants",
        query: { rating: { $gte: 4 } },
        readConcern: { level: "majority" }
      }
   )

.. include:: /includes/usage-read-concern-majority.rst
