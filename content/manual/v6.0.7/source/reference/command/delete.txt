.. dbcommand:: delete

   The :dbcommand:`delete` command removes documents from a collection.
   A single :dbcommand:`delete` command can contain multiple delete
   specifications. The delete methods provided by the MongoDB drivers
   use this command internally.

   .. versionchanged:: 5.0

   .. |method| replace:: :method:`~db.collection.deleteOne`,
      :method:`~db.collection.deleteMany`, and
      :method:`~db.collection.findOneAndDelete`
      helper methods
   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand-tip

   :returns:
 
      A document that contains the status of the operation.
      See :ref:`delete-command-output` for details.

Syntax
------

.. _delete-syntax:

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
        delete: <collection>, 
        deletes: [
           { 
             q : <query>, 
             limit : <integer>, 
             collation: <document>,
             hint: <document|string>
           },
           ...
        ],
        comment: <any>,
        let: <document>, // Added in MongoDB 5.0
        ordered: <boolean>,
        writeConcern: { <write concern> }
     }
  )

Behavior
--------

Sharded Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |single-modification-operation-names| replace:: :dbcommand:`delete`

.. |single-modification-operation-option| replace:: ``limit: 1``

.. include:: /includes/fact-single-modification-in-sharded-collections.rst


Limits
~~~~~~

The total size of all the queries (i.e. the ``q`` field values) in the
``deletes`` array must be less than or equal to the :limit:`maximum
BSON document size <BSON Document Size>`.

The total number of delete documents in the ``deletes`` array must be
less than or equal to the :limit:`maximum bulk size
<Write Command Batch Limit Size>`.

Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-supported-operation.rst

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-operations-write-concern.rst

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-usage.rst


Examples
--------

Limit the Number of Documents Deleted
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example deletes from the ``orders`` collection one
document that has the ``status`` equal to ``D`` by specifying the
``limit`` of ``1``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
         delete: "orders",
         deletes: [ { q: { status: "D" }, limit: 1 } ]
      }
   )

The returned document shows that the command deleted ``1`` document.
See :ref:`delete-command-output` for details.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "ok" : 1, "n" : 1 }

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-single-modification-in-sharded-collections.rst

Delete All Documents That Match a Condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example deletes from the ``orders`` collection all
documents that have the ``status`` equal to ``D`` by specifying the
``limit`` of ``0``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
         delete: "orders",
         deletes: [ { q: { status: "D" }, limit: 0 } ],
         writeConcern: { w: "majority", wtimeout: 5000 }
      }
   )

The returned document shows that the command found and deleted ``13``
documents. See :ref:`delete-command-output` for details.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "ok" : 1, "n" : 13 }

Delete All Documents from a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Delete all documents in the ``orders`` collection by specifying an
empty query condition *and* a ``limit`` of ``0``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
         delete: "orders",
         deletes: [ { q: { }, limit: 0 } ],
         writeConcern: { w: "majority", wtimeout: 5000 }
      }
   )

The returned document shows that the command found and deleted ``35``
documents in total. See :ref:`delete-command-output` for details.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "ok" : 1, "n" : 35 }

Bulk Delete
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example performs multiple delete operations on the
``orders`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
         delete: "orders",
         deletes: [
            { q: { status: "D" }, limit: 0 },
            { q: { cust_num: 99999, item: "abc123", status: "A" }, limit: 1 }
         ],
         ordered: false,
         writeConcern: { w: 1 }
      }
   )

The returned document shows that the command found and deleted ``21``
documents in total for the two delete statements. See
:ref:`delete-command-output` for details.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "ok" : 1, "n" : 21 }

Specify Collation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-versionadded.rst

A collection ``myColl`` has the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: 1, category: "café", status: "A" }
   { _id: 2, category: "cafe", status: "a" }
   { _id: 3, category: "cafE", status: "a" }

The following operation includes the :ref:`collation <collation>`
option:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand({
      delete: "myColl",
      deletes: [
        { q: { category: "cafe", status: "a" }, limit: 0, collation: { locale: "fr", strength: 1 } }
      ]
   })

.. _ex-delete-command-hint:

Specify ``hint`` for Delete Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 4.4

In :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, create a ``members`` collection
with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.members.insertMany([
      { "_id" : 1, "member" : "abc123", "status" : "P", "points" :  0,  "misc1" : null, "misc2" : null },
      { "_id" : 2, "member" : "xyz123", "status" : "A", "points" : 60,  "misc1" : "reminder: ping me at 100pts", "misc2" : "Some random comment" },
      { "_id" : 3, "member" : "lmn123", "status" : "P", "points" :  0,  "misc1" : null, "misc2" : null },
      { "_id" : 4, "member" : "pqr123", "status" : "D", "points" : 20,  "misc1" : "Deactivated", "misc2" : null },
      { "_id" : 5, "member" : "ijk123", "status" : "P", "points" :  0,  "misc1" : null, "misc2" : null },
      { "_id" : 6, "member" : "cde123", "status" : "A", "points" : 86,  "misc1" : "reminder: ping me at 100pts", "misc2" : "Some random comment" }
   ])

Create the following indexes on the collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.members.createIndex( { status: 1 } )
   db.members.createIndex( { points: 1 } )

The following delete operation explicitly hints to use the index
``{ status: 1 }``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand({
      delete: "members",
      deletes: [
        { q: { "points": { $lte: 20 }, "status": "P" }, limit: 0, hint: { status: 1 } }
      ]
   })

.. note::
   
   If you specify an index that does not exist, the operation errors.

To see the index used, run :dbcommand:`explain` on the operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
        explain: {
          delete: "members",
          deletes: [ 
            { q: { "points": { $lte: 20 }, "status": "P" }, limit: 0, hint: { status: 1 } }
          ]
        },
        verbosity: "queryPlanner"
      }
   )

.. _delete-let-example:

Use Variables in ``let``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |let-option| replace:: :ref:`let <delete-let-syntax>`

.. include:: /includes/let-example-introduction.rst

.. include:: /includes/let-example-delete-flavors.rst

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( {
      delete: db.cakeFlavors.getName(),
      deletes: [ {
         q: { $expr: { $eq: [ "$flavor", "$$targetFlavor" ] } },
         limit: 1
      } ],
      let : { targetFlavor: "strawberry" }
   } )

.. _delete-command-output:

.. data:: delete.ok

   The status of the command.

.. data:: delete.n

   The number of documents deleted.

   .. data:: delete.writeErrors.errmsg

      A description of the error.

.. data:: delete.writeConcernError

   Document that describe error related to write concern and contains
   the fields:

   .. data:: delete.writeConcernError.code

      An integer value identifying the cause of the write concern error.

   .. data:: delete.writeConcernError.errmsg

      A description of the cause of the write concern error.

The following is an example document returned for a successful
:dbcommand:`delete` command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { ok: 1, n: 1 }

The following is an example document returned for a :dbcommand:`delete`
command that encountered an error because it specified a non-existent
index in the ``hint`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     n: 0,
     writeErrors: [
       {
         index: 0,
         code: 2,
         errmsg: 'error processing query: ns=test.products: hat $eq "bowler"\n' +
           'Sort: {}\n' +
           'Proj: {}\n' +
           ' planner returned error :: caused by :: hint provided does not correspond to an existing index'
       }
     ],
     ok: 1
   }
