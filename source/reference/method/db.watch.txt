Definition
----------

.. method:: db.watch( pipeline, options )

   .. versionadded:: 4.0

      Requires ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` (fCV) set to
      ``"4.0"`` or greater. For more information on fCV, see
      :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

   Opens a :ref:`change stream cursor <changeStreams>` for a database
   to report on all its non-``system`` collections.

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-db.watch-param.rst

   The ``options`` document can contain the following fields and values:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-db.watch-options.rst

   :returns:
      A :term:`cursor` over the change event documents.
      See :doc:`/reference/change-events` for examples of change
      event documents.

   .. seealso::  :method:`db.collection.watch()` and :method:`Mongo.watch()`

Behavior
--------

- You cannot run :method:`db.watch()` on the ``admin``, ``local``, or
  ``config`` database.

- :method:`db.watch()` only notifies on data changes that have
  persisted to a majority of data-bearing members.

- The :ref:`change stream cursor <changeStreams>` remains open as long
  as a connection to the MongoDB deployment remains open and no
  database or collection is dropped.

- You can run :method:`db.watch()` for a database that does not exist.
  However, once the database is created and you drop the database, the
  change stream cursor closes.

- :method:`db.watch()` is available for replica sets and sharded
  clusters:

  - For a replica set, you can issue :method:`db.watch()` on any
    data-bearing member.

  - For a sharded cluster, you must issue :method:`db.watch()` on a
    :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

- You can only use :method:`db.watch()` with the :ref:`Wired Tiger
  storage engine <storage-wiredtiger>`.

Resumability
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike the MongoDB :ecosystem:`drivers </drivers>`, the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell does not automatically attempt to resume a
change stream cursor after an error. The MongoDB drivers make *one*
attempt to automatically resume a change stream cursor after certain
errors.

If the operation identified by the resume token passed to the
``resumeAfter`` option has already dropped off the :term:`oplog`,
:method:`db.watch()` cannot resume the change stream.

:method:`db.watch()` uses information stored in the oplog
to produce the change event
description and generate a resume token associated to that operation. If
enough time has passed such that the data changing operation which
generated the resume token is no longer present in the oplog, you cannot
use that token to resume the change stream.


See :ref:`change-stream-resume` for complete documentation on
resuming a change stream.

Full Document Lookup of Update Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the :ref:`change stream cursor <changeStreams>` returns
specific field changes/deltas for update operations. You can also
configure the change stream to look up and return the current
majority-committed version of the changed document. Depending on other
write operations that may have occurred between the update and the
lookup, the returned document may differ significantly from the
document at the time of the update.

Depending on the number of changes applied during the update operation
and the size of the full document, there is a risk that the size of the
change event document for an update operation is greater than the 16MB
BSON document limit. If this occurs, the server closes the change stream
cursor and returns an error.

Access Control
--------------

When running with access control, the user must have the
:authaction:`find` and :authaction:`changeStream` privilege actions on
the :ref:`database resource <resource-document>`. That is, a user must
have a :ref:`role <roles>` that grants the following :ref:`privilege
<privileges>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { resource: { db: <dbname>, collection: "" }, actions: [ "find", "changeStream"] }
 
Example
-------

The following operation in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell opens a
change stream cursor on the ``hr`` database. The returned cursor
reports on data changes to all the non-``system`` collections in that
database.

.. code-block:: javascript

   watchCursor = db.getSiblingDB("hr").watch()

Iterate the cursor to check for new events. Use the
:method:`cursor.isExhausted()` method to ensure the loop only exits
if the change stream cursor is closed *and* there are no objects
remaining in the latest batch:

.. code-block:: javascript

   while (!watchCursor.isExhausted()){
      if (watchCursor.hasNext()){
         printjson(watchCursor.next());
      }
   }

:ref:`change-stream-output`.
