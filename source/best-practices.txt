With |service-fullname| as your data platform, operational focus can
shift away from the mundane operational tasks and workflows required to
build and maintain database infrastructure, allowing you to focus on
helping engineers add value to the business. Instead of maintaining
hardware and keeping up with operating system-level software patches,
engineers can devote their time and energy to developing data models
that meet the current and future requirements of your enterprise.

This document outlines some best practices for establishing and
maintaining a successful MongoDB production deployment on
|service-fullname|.

Roles and Responsibilities
--------------------------

MongoDB manages and operates the infrastructure required to provide a
MongoDB Database Service to the customer. MongoDB's responsibilities
include the following:

- Manage the database clusters and underlying infrastructure, ensuring
  availability, stability, and performance of MongoDB, backed by a
  99.995%
  :website:`Uptime Service Level Agreement (SLA) </cloud/atlas/availability-sla>`
  for clusters of size ``M30`` and larger.

- Ensure the health of the underlying compute nodes. Make sure they are
  running, have network connectivity, and have all recommended OS-level
  patches to maintain the
  :website:`Uptime SLA </cloud/atlas/availability-sla>`.

- Manage the MongoDB database configuration based on the customer's
  specific design choices made via the Atlas user interface or
  :doc:`REST API </api>`.

- Apply all MongoDB maintenance upgrades automatically to ensure the
  latest bug fixes to the product are in use.

- Manage the security profile, including
  :doc:`Role-Based Access Control </security-add-mongodb-users>`,
  :doc:`adding IP addresses to an IP access list </security/ip-access-list>`, and
  :doc:`peering </security-vpc-peering>` to
  maximize cluster security per the customer's direction.

- Provide :doc:`backup and restore </backup-restore-cluster>` services.

The customer continues to develop and deploy applications which access
MongoDB, without having to directly manage the underlying database
resources and/or infrastructure.

Organization and Project-Level Management
-----------------------------------------

|service-fullname| abstracts away database operations so that you can
focus on high-value, high-level management decisions.

Creating a well-designed hierarchy of
:doc:`organizations and projects <organizations-projects>` within
|service| allows for maximum enterprise efficiency with minimum
operational friction.

.. tip::

   If you need to create more than the |service| organization limit of 
   250 projects, create additional organizations to store them.

   Use :ref:`Cross-Organization Billing <cross-org-billing>` to link 
   multiple |service| organizations and receive a single invoice for 
   all of them.

.. seealso::
   
   - :ref:`Atlas Organization and Project Limits <org-project-limits>`
   - :ref:`Cross-Organization Billing Use Cases <cross-org-billing-use-cases>`

The Organization Level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the :doc:`Organization </tutorial/manage-organizations>` level, you
can implement security controls and create users which work across one
or more :doc:`Projects </tutorial/manage-projects>`. |service|
:doc:`billing </billing/>` occurs at the Organization level.

To efficiently control user access and privileges, you can group users
into :doc:`teams </access/manage-teams-in-orgs>` at the Organization
level.

The Project Level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Projects offer a security isolation and authorization boundary, so they
are typically allocated by application team and application
environment. For example, within two application teams there might be
six projects: one for each team in the Development, Staging, and
Production environments.

You can create project-level |service|
:doc:`users and roles </security-add-mongodb-users>` with appropriate
access to the different production and development application
environments.

- Users with the :authrole:`Project Read Only` role can access
  project-level monitoring and system health metadata without having
  access to any collection data or administrative operations.

- Users with the :authrole:`Project Cluster Manager` role can scale
  clusters and perform other administrative operations, but have no
  data-level access.

Other project-level responsibilities include:

- Implement optional enterprise security features, including:

  - :doc:`Encryption with customer key management </security-kms-encryption>`
  - :doc:`Database auditing </database-auditing>`
  - :doc:`LDAP </security-ldaps>`

- Set up network access configuration, including:

  - :doc:`VPC / VNet Peering </security-vpc-peering>`
  - :doc:`Adding IP addresses to an IP access list </security/ip-access-list>`

- Define appropriate :doc:`database alerts <monitoring-alerts>` via the
  |service| interface or API and respond to any which require
  attention.

- Integrate with external :doc:`monitoring/alerting systems
  </tutorial/manage-project-settings>`, such as DataDog and New Relic.

Application Management
----------------------

Application-level responsibilities include:

- :manual:`Schema design </core/data-modeling-introduction>`, including
  query and index optimization.

- Cluster tier and topology selection. Choosing the appropriate cluster
  :doc:`size </cluster-tier>` and topology (:term:`replica set` or
  :term:`sharded cluster`), along with :doc:`storage capacity and IOPS
  </customize-storage/>` is crucial for optimal database performance.

- Provisioning of non-production clusters. Production backups can be
  restored into non-production clusters with the |service| UI or the
  API.

- Capacity planning. Determining when additional computational capacity
  is needed, typically using the
  :doc:`monitoring telemetry </monitor-cluster-metrics>` that |service|
  provides. Additional capacity can be added with no application
  downtime, and you can optionally enable
  :doc:`auto-scaling </cluster-autoscaling/>` to respond automatically
  to spikes in usage.

- Deciding when to implement a major database
  :doc:`version upgrade </tutorial/major-version-change/>`.

- Implementing and testing a
  :doc:`backup and restoration </backup-restore-cluster/>` plan.

- Ensuring that applications gracefully handle cluster failover through
  :doc:`testing </tutorial/test-failover/>`.

- Configuring data analytics services with tools such as
  :bic:`BI Connector </>` and :charts:`Charts </>`.

Scaling
~~~~~~~

MongoDB Atlas offers two methods for scaling, vertical and horizontal.

*Vertical scaling* involves increasing a cluster’s storage capacity,
computing power, and/or |iops| rate. Vertical scaling can be
accomplished quickly and is useful for peak usage periods. Vertically
scaling from :term:`shared clusters <shared cluster>` (``M2`` and
``M5``) requires a few minutes of downtime whereas scaling between
:term:`dedicated clusters <dedicated cluster>` (``M10`` and greater)
happens without downtime.

When scaling vertically, ``M30`` and higher clusters are recommended for
production environments. You can use the following cluster tiers as
production environments for low-traffic applications, but these tiers
are recommended for development environments:

- ``M2`` and ``M5`` shared clusters
- ``M10`` and ``M20`` dedicated clusters

*Horizontal scaling* involves implementing
:manual:`sharding </sharding/>` or adding additional shards to an
existing sharded cluster. Horizontal scaling requires careful planning
and execution, and is part of a long-term growth strategy for ``M30+``
clusters.

Vertical and horizontal sharding can be combined in Atlas. For example,
a sharded cluster can be vertically scaled up for a peak period,
increasing the storage capacity and computing power of the individual
sharded cluster members.

By default, |service| :doc:`vertically auto-scales cluster storage
</cluster-autoscaling/>` up to your configured cluster tier size limit.

You can configure |service| to
:doc:`automatically scale </cluster-autoscaling/>` your cluster tier
and cluster storage capacity in response to increased cluster usage,
allowing for a rapid, automated response to a need for greater storage
computing power.

Single Region and Multi-Region Clusters
---------------------------------------

High availability and cluster durability depend on a cluster's
geographical deployment configuration. Clusters which are deployed
within a single :doc:`region </cloud-providers-regions>` are spread
across availability zones within that region, so they can withstand
partial region outages without an interruption of read or write
availability.

You can optionally choose to spread your clusters across two or
more regions for greater resiliency and
:doc:`workload isolation </workload-isolation>`.

The order of regions determines the priority order for the location of
the :manual:`primary node </core/replica-set-members#replica-set-primary-member>`.
Therefore, if you wish to direct database write operations to a
particular region when that region is available, you should list that
region first. The second region on the list should be the second
choice for where writes should go if the first region is unavailable.

The following example from the |service|
:doc:`Create a Cluster </tutorial/create-new-cluster/>` UI shows a
multi-region cluster with electable nodes in three different regions,
arranged by priority from highest to lowest:

.. figure:: /images/multi-region-cluster.png
   :alt: Screenshot of electable nodes across three regions
   :figwidth: 550px

If the :guilabel:`us-east-1` region becomes unavailable, a new primary
will be elected in the :guilabel:`us-west-1` region.

.. note::

   Clusters must have an odd number of nodes to ensure primary
   electability. To learn more, see
   :manual:`Replica Set Elections </core/replica-set-elections/>`.

Deployment in Two Regions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deploying a cluster to two regions ensures that a copy of your data
will always be maintained in more than one region. However, a loss of
the region which contains a majority of the nodes in the cluster will
leave the second region in a read-only state until an administrator
intervenes or the original region becomes available.

Deployment in Three or More Regions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deploying a cluster to three or more regions ensures that the cluster
can withstand a full region-level outage while maintaining read and
write availability, provided the application layer is fault-tolerant.

If maintaining write operations in your preferred region at all times
is a high priority, it is recommended to deploy the cluster so that at
least two :manual:`electable members
</core/replica-set-architecture-geographically-distributed#electability-of-members>`
are in at least two data centers within your preferred region.

Global Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the best database performance in a worldwide deployment, users can
configure a :doc:`global cluster </global-clusters>` which uses
location-aware sharding to minimize read and write latency. Users with
geographical storage requirements can also ensure that data is stored
in a particular geographical area.

.. _audit-temp-db-users:

Auditing Temporary Database Users
---------------------------------

Enabling auditing for all database users, including application service 
users, might severely affect cluster performance. If you need to audit 
the actions of a temporary database user, you can create a custom role 
targeted for auditing, create a temporary user with elevated privileges, 
and grant this user the custom role to audit their actions.

To audit the actions of a temporary database user:

.. include:: /includes/steps/db-audit-temp-user.rst

Support
-------

Different tiers of :doc:`support </support/>` are available, including
options for customers in development and for enterprise customers.

Possible support areas include:

- Issues and concerns with the MongoDB clusters under management.
- Performance-related inquiries.
- Application-side and :manual:`driver </ecosystem/>` consultation.
