  The authentication restrictions the server enforces upon the user.
  Specifies a list of IP addresses and
  :abbr:`CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)` ranges from which the
  user is allowed to connect to the server or from which the server can
  accept users.

type: array

   The specific SCRAM mechanism or mechanisms for the user credentials.
   If :parameter:`authenticationMechanisms` is specified, you can only
   specify a subset of the :parameter:`authenticationMechanisms`.

   If updating the mechanisms field without the password, you can only
   specify a subset of the user's current mechanisms, and only the
   existing user credentials for the specified mechanism or mechanisms
   are retained.

   If updating the password along with the mechanisms, new set of
   credentials are stored for the user.

   Valid values are:

   - ``"SCRAM-SHA-1"``

     - Uses the ``SHA-1`` hashing function.

   - ``"SCRAM-SHA-256"``

     - Uses the ``SHA-256`` hashing function.

     - Requires featureCompatibilityVersion set to ``4.0``.

     - Requires {{digest}} to be {{defaultdigest}}.

   Indicates whether the server or the client digests the password.

   If true, the server receives undigested password from the client and
   digests the password.

   If false, the client digests the password and passes the digested
   password to the server. Not compatible with ``SCRAM-SHA-256``

   .. versionchanged:: 4.0

      The default value is ``true``. In earlier versions, the default
      value is ``false``.
