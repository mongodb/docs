:ref:`System and disk alert <system-disk-alerts>` conditions can 
indicate IOPS issues.

Alert Conditions
----------------
   
You can configure the following alert conditions in the project-level 
:ref:`alert settings <configure-alerts>` page to trigger alerts.

The :alert:`Disk read IOPS on Data Partition is` alert condition is 
raised if the average number of disk read operations per second exceeds 
the specified threshold.

The :alert:`Disk write IOPS on Data Partition is` alert condition is 
raised if the average number of disk write operations per second 
exceeds the specified threshold.

:alert:`System: CPU (User) % is` measures the CPU usage of the 
processes on the node, normalized by the number of CPUs. This value is 
scaled to a range of 0-100%.

Common Triggers
---------------

A few common events may trigger these alerts:

- :manual:`Unoptimized queries </core/query-optimization/>`.

- A one-time event, such as an :manual:`index build 
  </core/index-creation>`.

Fix the Immediate Problem
-------------------------

Consider a few possible actions to help resolve
these alerts:

- :manual:`Optimize your queries </core/query-optimization/>`.

- Use the |service| :doc:`Performance Advisor </performance-advisor/>`
  to view slow queries and suggested :manual:`indexes </indexes>`.

- Review :manual:`Indexing Strategies </applications/indexes/>` for
  possible further indexing improvements.

  .. note::

     You may need to temporarily increase your cluster |iops| to create
     new indexes. To change a cluster's |iops|, go to the
     :guilabel:`Cluster Configuration` page and:

Implement a Long-Term Solution
------------------------------

Disk IOPS Burst Credits for |service| {+Clusters+} on |azure|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| {+clusters+} deployed to |azure| may use credit-based 
bursting, but the disk will burst only if it has burst credits 
accumulated in its credit bucket. |azure| also offers an on-demand 
bursting model, where the disk bursts whenever its needs exceed its 
current capacity.

See the |azure| :azure:`Disk Bursting documentation 
</virtual-machines/disk-bursting>` for more information about how bursting 
for |azure| disks works. 

Conserve Burst Credits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you regularly exceed your configured |iops| threshold, you can avoid
depleting your burst credits by increasing your configured |iops| with
any of the following actions:

- :ref:`Increase Cluster IOPS <scale-cluster-storage>` to increase the
  cluster's |iops| threshold.

- :ref:`Increase Storage Capacity <scale-cluster-storage>`. The
  |iops| threshold increases as you increase storage capacity. Clusters
  configured to use at least 1 TB of storage have baseline |iops|
  performance that is equal to or greater than the maximum burst
  performance. These volumes do not deplete burst credit balances.

- :ref:`Upgrade Cluster Tier <scale-cluster-instance>`. Larger cluster
  tiers include higher |iops| thresholds.

  .. note::

    Cluster tiers ``M140`` and larger are deployed with at least 1 TB
    of storage capacity by default. Clusters with 1 TB or more of
    storage capacity do not deplete burst credit balances.

Monitor Your Progress
---------------------

These are a few possible methods to observe high disk I/O:

- The disk |iops| use from the :guilabel:`Disk IOPS` graph in the
  cluster :doc:`metrics </monitor-cluster-metrics>` exceeds the
  provisioned |iops| from the |service| {+cluster+}
  :doc:`configuration page </scale-cluster>`.

- The :guilabel:`Normalized System CPU`
  :doc:`metric </monitor-cluster-metrics>`
  has a high :guilabel:`IOWait` curve. IOWait measures the percentage
  of time the CPU is idle and waiting for an I/O operation to complete.
  The :guilabel:`Normalized System CPU` chart is located under the
  :guilabel:`Hardware Metrics` section of the :guilabel:`Metrics` tab.
