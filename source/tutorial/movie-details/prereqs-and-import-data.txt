*Estimated Time to Complete: 10 minutes*

Prerequisites
-------------

To complete this tutorial you will need a
`MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`_ cluster. Refer
to the :atlas:`Create a Cluster </create-new-cluster/>` documentation
for instructions on creating an |service| cluster.

Load the Sample Data into Your |service| Cluster
------------------------------------------------

|service| provides sample data you can load into your |service|
cluster. To load sample data into your cluster:

.. include:: /includes/steps/load-sample-data.rst

The following is a sample document from the dataset:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "_id": {
       "$oid": "573a1390f29313caabcd413b"
     },
     "title": "The Arrival of a Train",
     "year": {
       "$numberInt": "1896"
     },
     "runtime": {
       "$numberInt": "1"
     },
     "released": {
       "$date": {
         "$numberLong": "-2335219200000"
       }
     },
     "poster": "http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/   MV5BMjEyNDk5MDYzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjIxMTEwMzE@._V1_SX300.jpg",
     "plot": "A group of people are standing in a straight line along the
       platform of a railway station, waiting for a train, which is seen
       coming at some distance. When the train stops at the platform, ...",
     "fullplot": "A group of people are standing in a straight line along
       the platform of a railway station, waiting for a train, which is
       seen coming at some distance. When the train stops at the platform,
       the line dissolves. The doors of the railway-cars open, and people
       on the platform help passengers to get off.",
     "lastupdated": "2015-08-15 00:02:53.443000000",
     "type": "movie",
     "directors": [

       "Louis Lumière"
     ],
     "imdb": {
       "rating": {
         "$numberDouble": "7.3"
       },
       "votes": {
         "$numberInt": "5043"
       },
       "id": {
         "$numberInt": "12"
       }
     },
     "countries": [
       "France"
     ],
     "genres": [
       "Documentary",
       "Short"
     ],
     "tomatoes": {
       "viewer": {
         "rating": {
           "$numberDouble": "3.7"
         },
         "numReviews": {
           "$numberInt": "59"
         }
       },
       "lastUpdated": {
         "$date": {
           "$numberLong": "1441993589000"
         }
       }
     },
     "num_mflix_comments": {
       "$numberInt": "1"
     }
   }

Add the Mflix Collections as Data Sources
-----------------------------------------

Once the load operation completes, you can add the collections
containing the sample data as :doc:`data sources </data-sources>` in
|charts-short|. Adding a collection as a data source links the
collection to |charts-short| and allows you to visualize that data.

.. include:: /includes/steps/add-data-source-mflix.rst

Next Steps
----------

Now that you have established the data source in |charts-short|, you
can :ref:`Create a New Dashboard <movie-data-new-dash>` which will
hold the visualizations.
