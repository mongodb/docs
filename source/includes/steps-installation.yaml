title: Test your connection to the |charts-short| metadata database.
ref: test-mongodb-connection
level: 4
stepnum: 5
content: |

   |charts| requires a :manual:`Connection String URI
   </reference/connection-string>` to connect to a MongoDB deployment
   which will store the |charts-short| metadata. The MongoDB deployment
   must be reachable from the |charts-short| host. If the MongoDB
   deployment is running with :manual:`authentication enabled
   </tutorial/enable-authentication>`, you must provide the credentials
   in the connection string, and the MongoDB user must have the
   :authrole:`readWriteAnyDatabase` role. When connecting to a replica
   set, the :urioption:`replicaSet` URI option is required.

   .. admonition:: Running Metadata Database on localhost
      :class: important

      |charts-short| interprets ``localhost`` as the Docker container
      |charts-short| is running in. If the database is running on the
      same host as the |charts-short| Docker container but not in
      Docker, it will not be reachable via
      ``mongodb://localhost``. Instead, use one of the following URIs
      depending on your Docker version when creating the Docker secret
      in the command below:

      - For Docker versions 18.03 and later:

        - For Windows and macOS, use ``mongodb://host.docker.internal``.

        - For Linux, use the IP address of the ``docker0`` interface.
          Normally, this address is ``172.17.0.1``.

      - For Docker versions 17.06 up to but not including 18.03:

        - For Windows, use ``mongodb://docker.for.win.localhost``.

        - For macOS, use ``mongodb://docker.for.mac.localhost``.

        - For Linux, use the IP address of the ``docker0`` interface.
          Normally, this address is ``172.17.0.1``.

   Run the following command to test your connection string. Replace
   the placeholder connection string at the end of the command with
   your connection string URI:

   .. code-block:: sh

      docker run -it quay.io/mongodb/charts:{+version+} charts-cli test-connection mongodb://<username>:<password>@myhost.com/

   .. include:: /includes/different-versions.rst

   If the |charts| successfully connects to the specified MongoDB
   deployment, |charts-short| displays the following message in the
   command line:

   .. code-block:: sh
      :copyable: false

      MongoDB connection URI successfully verified.

   .. note::

      Pay careful attention to the output of this command, as it
      may include warnings of potential issues which could impact
      the deployment process.

   If |charts| cannot connect using the specified connection URI,
   |charts-short| outlines possible troubleshooting actions to take
   to create a successful connection. For detailed troubleshooting
   information, refer to the :ref:`Troubleshooting
   <charts-install-troubleshooting>` section.

   Once you have verified that |charts| can successfully connect to
   your MongoDB deployment, create a Docker Secret to hold the
   :manual:`Connection String URI </reference/connection-string>`.

   Run the following command to create the Docker secret, substituting
   your connection string from the previous step:

   .. code-block:: sh

      echo "<Verified connection string URI from step 5>" | docker secret create charts-mongodb-uri -

title: Enable or disable the Feedback and Support widget.
ref: feedback-support-widget
level: 4
stepnum: 7
content: |
  By default, the Feedback and Support widget is enabled. It allows
  |charts-short| to collect and transmit usage data including operations
  the user performed, the chart types they use, and any errors returned
  by |charts-short|. The logged-in user's email and name is sent to the
  Intercom system to help provide support. No data is collected
  or transmitted from the user's database.

  If you want to disable the widget within |charts| and prevent the
  transmission of usage statistics, open ``charts-docker-compose.yml``
  and set ``CHARTS_SUPPORT_WIDGET_AND_METRICS`` to ``"off"``:

  .. code-block:: sh

     CHARTS_SUPPORT_WIDGET_AND_METRICS: "off"

title: Launch the |charts-short| container.
ref: launch-charts-container
level: 4
stepnum: 8
content: |
  Launch the |charts-short| container as a Docker Stack using the
  Compose file:

  .. code-block:: sh

     docker stack deploy -c charts-docker-compose-{+version+}.yml mongodb-charts

  .. include:: /includes/different-versions.rst

---
title: Verify the container is running.
ref: verify-container
level: 4
stepnum: 9
content: |
  Check that the container is running by executing:

  .. code-block:: sh

     docker service ls

  The |charts-short| container should appear with mode ``replicated``
  with ``1/1`` replicas:

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false

     ID             NAME                    MODE         REPLICAS   IMAGE                   PORTS
     j77uo3slyg4l   mongodb-charts_charts   replicated   1/1        mongodb-charts:latest   *:80->80/tcp
post: |
  .. note::

     The service's mode may not be ``replicated`` immediately. Docker
     does not display the status of certain deployment operations, so
     wait briefly then rerun ``docker service ls``.

     If the service is stuck at ``0/1`` replicas and it's mode is not
     ``replicated`` after an extended period of time, the service may
     not have deployed properly. For more information, see
     :ref:`Troubleshooting <charts-install-troubleshooting>`.

title: Create |charts-short| users.
ref: create-users
level: 4
stepnum: 10
content: |
  Once the container is running, execute the ``charts-cli add-user``
  script within the container once for each |charts-short| user account
  you want to create within |charts|. At mininum, you must use the script
  to create one user with the ``UserAdmin`` role in order to be able to
  log into |charts-short|. After creating this initial user, you
  can either use the |charts-short| user interface to
  :ref:`add users <add-users>` or continue using the
  ``charts-cli add-user`` script to add users with either the
  ``UserAdmin`` or ``User`` role.

  .. include:: /includes/add-user-script.rst

  For more information on roles and adding users, see
  :doc:`/user-management`.

  Access |charts| by opening a web browser and connecting to the

  runs on HTTP port 80 unless you have modified the Docker Compose file
  to use a different port.
