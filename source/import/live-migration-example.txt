You may choose to :ref:`live migrate (pull) <lm-pull-c2c-procedure>`
a source replica set running MongoDB {+c2c-version+}+ to a sharded destination
MongoDB {+c2c-version+}+ {+cluster+}. In this case, you might specify the
sharding configuration, similar to the following example, in the live migration {+atlas-ui+}. 

MongoDB shards only those collections that you include into the ``shardingEntries``
array. The array specifies which collections to shard. To learn more,
see :manual:`Sharding </sharding>`.

If you choose to omit providing sharding configuration during the migration,
you can always shard collections on the destination {+cluster+} after you
migrate your {+cluster+} to |service|.

.. code-block:: json

   {
    "shardingEntries": [
               {
                   "database": "database-name",
                   "collection": "collection-name",
                   "shardCollection": {
                      "key": [
                         { "location": 1 },
                         { "region": 1 }
                      ]
                   }
               }
            ]
   }

In addition to this configuration, the |service| destination {+cluster+}
also needs a compatible index for the specified sharding keys. When starting
the migration via the {+atlas-ui+}, you can configure MongoDB to create
these supporting indexes automatically. To learn more,
see :ref:`Live migrate (pull) a MongoDB {+c2c-version+} {+cluster+} into Atlas <lm-pull-c2c-procedure>`.
