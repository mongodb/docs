You can grant users access to your group in the "Users" section of
the MMS console. Click on the plus (``+``) icon next to your account
name and enter their email in the dialogue.  If the console finds a
connected account, MMS will automatically add the user to the MMS
console.

.. note::

   With a self-hosted MMS installation, user accounts and groups are
   independent from JIRA. This is in contrast to the `MMS SaaS
   provided by 10gen <http://mms.10gen.com>`_, which shares account
   and group information with the `MongoDB JIRA
   <http://jira.mongodb.org/>`_ instance.

Users can create accounts at any time using the account registration
page of your MMS installation.
