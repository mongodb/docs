"MongoDB reserves the ``_id`` field in the top level of all documents as a "
"primary key. ``_id`` must be unique, and always has an index with a "
":ref:`unique constraint <index-type-unique>`. However, except for the unique"
" constraint you can use any value for the ``_id`` field in your collections."
" This tutorial describes two methods for creating an incrementing sequence "
"number for the ``_id`` field using the following:"

"Generally in MongoDB, you would not use an auto-increment pattern for the "
"``_id`` field, or any field, because it does not scale for databases with "
"large numbers of documents. Typically the default value :term:`ObjectId "
"<objectid>` is more ideal for the ``_id``."
