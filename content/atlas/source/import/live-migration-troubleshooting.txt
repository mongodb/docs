   :description: Troubleshoot common validation and post-validation errors during Atlas live migration and learn how to resolve them.
   :keywords: atlas live migration, migration errors, c2c, mongosync

Before the :ref:`live migration <live-migrate-c2c>` process begins,
|service| performs a validation check to ensure that all the necessary
form fields and parameters are functional and correct. If any
parameters are invalid, |service| returns an error and live migration does
not proceed.

This section describes common live migration validation errors and
provides suggestions for what to check if you encounter them.

Common Live Migration Validation Errors
---------------------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Error
     - Remediation

   * - Available disk space on the destination needs to be increased
     - To account for temporary data fluctuations during a migration, 
       the available disk space on the destination cluster must be larger 
       than what is being consumed on the source cluster.
       Ensure the destination cluster can handle the migration, and
       :ref:`increase your destination cluster's disk size <create-cluster-storage>`
       if necessary.

   * - Could not reach specified source
     - Ensure that you added the correct subnet ranges to the IP
       access list on the source cluster. You can find the four
       required subnet ranges in the live migration modal window.

       - Confirm that the hostname that you specified resolves to a public
         IP address. At a command prompt, use one of the following
         commands:

         .. code-block:: shell

            nslookup <hostname>
            ping <hostname>

       - Ensure that you are not using a :doc:`VPC Peering Connection
         </security-vpc-peering>`, which is not compatible with pull live
         migration.

   * - Could not resolve hostname
     - No IP address was found for the given hostname. Confirm that
       the given hostname is correct and publicly accessible.

   * - Disk storage info unavailable
     - To run the live migration (pull) process, the MongoDB user must
       have permissions on the source cluster's MongoDB instance. To learn more,
       see :ref:`Source Cluster Security <live-import-c2c-security>`.

   * - Invalid SSL options provided
     - If you are using SSL:

       - Confirm that your SSL certificate is complete and correctly
         copied to the live migration (pull) modal window.

       - Confirm that the :guilabel:`Is encryption in transit enabled?`
         toggle switch is in the ``Yes`` position.

       If you aren't using SSL:

       - Check your connection string and confirm that the ``ssl``
         query parameter is not present. If ``--ssl`` is part of your
         connection string, your cluster requires an SSL connection.

       - Confirm that the :guilabel:`Is encryption in transit enabled?`
         toggle switch is in the ``No`` position.

   * - Source appears to be a standalone
     - Your source deployment must be a MongoDB :manual:`replica set
       </replication>`. If your source deployment is currently a
       standalone node, :manual:`convert it
       </tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set>` to a single-node
       replica set before running live migration (pull).

   * - Source cluster contains a time series collection, which is unsupported
     - Ensure that the source cluster doesn't contain :manual:`time series collections </core/timeseries-collections>`,
       which `aren't supported <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongosync/current/reference/limitations/#unsupported-collection-types>`__.
       To filter your databases on the source cluster and identify which
       collections with time series data have caused the error, use
       the :manual:`listCollections </reference/command/listCollections/>` command,
       as in the following example:

       .. code-block:: shell

          db.runCommand({ listCollections: 1, filter:{ type: "timeseries" }}) 

   * - The username or password is not correct
     - Confirm your credentials in {+mongosh+} with the
       following commands:

       .. code-block:: javascript

          use admin
          db.getUser("<username>");

       If the issue persists, :manual:`update
       </tutorial/change-own-password-and-custom-data>` the MongoDB
       user's password.

   * - Unable to process the provided CA file
     - Confirm that your CA file is complete and correctly pasted into
       the live migration (pull) modal window.

   * - User does not have the required permissions for blocking writes during cutover
     - Ensure the user has the following permissions: :authaction:`bypassWriteBlockingMode`. 
       Also, ensure the user has all the :ref:`required roles <live-import-c2c-security>`
       to live migrate data.

   * - User not authorized to execute command
     - To run the live migration (pull) process, the MongoDB
       user must have sufficient system privileges.
       To learn more,
       see :ref:`Source Cluster Security <live-import-c2c-security>`.
