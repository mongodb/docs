MongoDB gives you the flexibility to normalize or duplicate your data to
optimize your application. If you duplicate data in your schema, you
must decide how to keep duplicated data consistent across multiple
collections. Some applications require duplicated data to be made
consistent immediately, whereas other applications can tolerate reading
stale data.

Use Cases
---------

There are multiple ways to enforce data consistency in your
application:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20 10 20

   * - Method
     - Description
     - Performance Impact
     - Use Case

   * - :ref:`Transactions <transactions>`
     - Updates to multiple collections occur in a single atomic
       operation.
     - Potentially high, due to read contention
     - Your application must always return up-to-date data, and
       can tolerate potential negative performance impact during
       periods of heavy reads.

   * - :ref:`Embed related data <data-modeling-embedding>`
     - Modify the application schema to embed related data in a
       single collection.
     - Low to moderate, depending on document size and indexes
     - Your application always reads and updates the related data
       at the same time. This solution simplifies your schema and
       prevents the need for :pipeline:`$lookup` operations.

   * - :atlas:`Atlas Database Triggers
       </atlas-ui/triggers/database-triggers>`
     - When an update occurs in one collection, triggers automatically
       update another collection.
     - Low to moderate, with potential delays in processing triggered
       events
     - Your application can tolerate reading slightly stale data. Users
       can potentially see outdated data if they run a query immediately
       after an update, but before the trigger finishes updating the
       second collection.

The best way to enforce data consistency depends on your
application. To learn more about the benefits and implementation
for each approach, refer to the corresponding documentation pages.

Details

The following factors can affect how you enforce data consistency.

Data Staleness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider how important it is that your application returns the most
up-to-date data. Some applications can return data that is minutes or
hours stale with no impact to the user.

For example, in an e-commerce application, a user needs to know
immediately whether or not an item is available. This information is
ideally kept as consistent as possible, even if it requires frequent
updates.

In contrast, analytic queries are typically expected to read slightly
stale data. It is not critical to keep analytic data completely
consistent.

Your application's tolerance for stale data affects how to best keep
data consistent. Frequently updating data in multiple collections
reduces the risk that a user reads stale data. However, frequent updates
can negatively impact your application's performance. When you enforce
data consistency, balance user needs with performance impact.

Referential Integrity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Referential integrity ensures that when an object is deleted, all
references to that object are also deleted.

For example, an application has a ``products`` collection and a
``warehouse`` collection that contains references to the ``products``
collection. When a product is deleted from the ``products`` collection,
the corresponding reference in the ``warehouse`` collection should also
be deleted.

If your schema requires referential integrity, incorporate logic into
your application to keep references consistent. At minimum, your
application logic should prevent errors when attempting to query a
reference that does not exist.
