Store a JavaScript Function on the Server

.. note::

   Do not store application logic in the database. There are performance
   limitations to running JavaScript inside of MongoDB. Application code
   also is typically most effective when it shares version control with
   the application itself.

There is a special system collection named ``system.js`` that can store
JavaScript functions for reuse.

To store a function, you can use the :method:`db.collection.insertOne()`, as
in the following examples:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.system.js.insertOne(
      {
        _id: "echoFunction",
        value : function(x) { return x; }
      }
   );

   db.system.js.insertOne(
      {
        _id : "myAddFunction" ,
        value : function (x, y){ return x + y; }
      }
   );

- The ``_id`` field holds the name of the function and is unique per
  database.

- The ``value`` field holds the function definition.

These functions, saved as BSON type :doc:`JavaScript
</reference/bson-types>`, are available for use from any JavaScript
context, such as :dbcommand:`mapReduce` and :query:`$where`.

Functions saved as the deprecated BSON type :doc:`JavaScript (with
scope) </reference/bson-types>`, however, cannot be used by
:dbcommand:`mapReduce` and :query:`$where` starting in MongoDB 4.4.
