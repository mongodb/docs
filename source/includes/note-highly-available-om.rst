.. admonition:: Highly Available Ops Manager Resources
   :class: note

   For high availability, set this value to more than ``1``. Multiple
   |onprem| instances can read from the same Application
   Database, ensuring failover if one instance is unavailable and
   enabling you to update the |onprem| resource without downtime.
