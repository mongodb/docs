When an index build completes, |service| generates 
an :ref:`activity feed event <view-activity-feed>`
and sends a notification email to the project owner 
with the following information:

- Completion date of the index build
- Name of the cluster on which the index build completed
- Namespace on which the index build completed
- Project containing the cluster and namespace
- Organization containing the project
- Link to the :ref:`activity feed event <view-activity-feed>`
