  a. In the left-side panel of your organization's page,
     click :guilabel:`Live Migration`.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Migrate from Ops Manager or Cloud Manager`.

  #. Click :guilabel:`I'm Ready to Start` and, if you are
     :opsmgr:`migrating </tutorial/migrate-community-to-atlas>` from
     MongoDB Community using |onprem|, click :guilabel:`Ops Manager
     License Agreement` to read and accept it. To read the agreement
     outside of the Live Migration Wizard, see the
     :opsmgr:`Ops Manager Migration Agreement
     </reference/legal/live-migration-atlas-licensing>`.

  |service| displays a Live Migration wizard with instructions on how
  to proceed with the process. The process pushes the data from your
  source {+cluster+} to the new destination {+cluster+}. After you complete
  the wizard steps, you can point your application to the new {+cluster+}.

level: 4
content: |

  a. Click :guilabel:`Generate Link-Token`. |service| displays the
     page for generating a :term:`link-token`.

     - If you are migrating from |onprem|, enter the external IP addresses
       or a |cidr| block of your |onprem| instances to add them to the access
       list of the API Key embedded in the link-token. This allows |onprem|
       to send project and cluster information to |service|.
       |onprem| does not send any data stored in your MongoDB databases
       in this step. For example, enter ``23.248.95.14``.
     - If you are migrating from |mms|, skip this step.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Next` to see a page that contains the generated link-token.

  #. Copy the link-token and store it in a secure location. |service|
     never displays the contents of the link-token. |service| also does
     not display the link-token after generating it. Do not
     share it publicly.

     .. note::
        Use one unique :term:`link-token` for live migrating all
        projects in one |com| organization to |service|.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Done`.

  a. Access the organization in |com|:
  
     Open |onprem| or |mms|, and navigate to the organization
     whose project's {+cluster+} you are live migrating to |service|.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Settings` in the left navigation panel.

  #. In the :guilabel:`Live Migration: Connect to Atlas` section, click
     :guilabel:`Connect to Atlas`. The :guilabel:`Connect to Atlas`
     dialog opens.

  #. Paste the link-token you generated in the previous step of the
     Live Migration wizard and click :guilabel:`Connect to Atlas`.
     |com| establishes the connection to |service|. Use the
     :guilabel:`Refresh` button to send an update to |service|, if
     needed. To learn more, see

    a. Click :guilabel:`Select Target Cluster from Projects`.

    #. Go to your destination |service| cluster's project and find your
       destination cluster.

    #. Click :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` and select :guilabel:`Migrate Data to this Cluster`
       from the dropdown list to start the migration.
       The :guilabel:`Migrate Data to This Cluster` page opens.

    #. Click :guilabel:`Migrate from Ops Manager or Cloud Manager` and
       fill in the fields as follows:

       - Select the source project in |com|, if it's not  already selected.
       - Select a migration host for handling the migration.

       - Review the IP address access list and check that the migration
         host's external IP address is included in this list. If it's not
         added, add it now:
         
         - Click :guilabel:`Set Network Access for Host`
         - Click :guilabel:`+ Add IP Address`
         - Return to the Live Migration wizard. Select the source
           cluster from the dropdown and choose
           :guilabel:`Migrate data to this cluster` under :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h`.
       
       - Select the source {+cluster+} from the drop-down.

       - If you suspend the source {+cluster+} from automation in |com|, but
         continue to monitor the source {+cluster+} with the Monitoring Agent,
         the :guilabel:`Username` and :guilabel:`Password` display. If
         your deployment requires user authentication, provide the user
         name and password in these fields. The database user whose
         credentials you provide must have at least the
         :manual:`backup role
         </reference/built-in-roles/#mongodb-authrole-backup>` on
         the admin database and must be authenticated using
         :manual:`both SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256 </core/security-scram/>`.

       - If the source cluster uses |tls-ssl|, toggle the
         :guilabel:`Is encryption in transit enabled?` button.

       - If the source cluster uses |tls-ssl| with a custom Root
         Certificate Authority (CA), copy the path to the
         :abbr:`CA (Certificate Authority)` file from your migration host
         and paste this path into the provided text box. The file must be
         present on the migration host to ensure the migration host can
         read the certificate. |service| check that the certificate is
         present and readable.

       - If your replica set destination {+cluster+} has data, and you
         want to preserve it, keep the
         :guilabel:`Clear any existing data on your destination cluster` option
         unchecked. The live migration service warns you if it finds duplicate
         namespaces. If you want to delete the existing data, check this
         option.

       - Choose a connection to connect to the {+cluster+}. The
         :guilabel:`Standard connection` always shows as available in
         the UI. However, other connection options are enabled only if
         you have previously configured a VPC peering connection or a
         private endpoint. If |service| detects that you don't have VPC
         connections or private endpoints configured, these options are
         grayed out.
       
         - If you aren't using VPC peering or a private endpoint, click
           :guilabel:`Standard connection` and proceed to the
           :guilabel:`Validation` stage of this step.

         - If you configured a :ref:`VPC peering connection <vpc-peering>`
           between the migration host and the |service| {+cluster+}, the
           :guilabel:`VPC Peering` option is active. Click
           :guilabel:`VPC Peering` to connect using VPC peering for live
           migration. If the :guilabel:`VPC Peering` option is grayed out,
           :ref:`configure a VPC peering connection <vpc-peering>` before
           starting this procedure. To learn more, see
           :ref:`migrate-from-com-vpc-support`.

         - If you are migrating a replica set and configured a
           :ref:`private endpoint <private-endpoint>` between the
           migration host and the |service| {+cluster+}, the
           :guilabel:`Private Endpoint` option is active. Click
           :guilabel:`Private Endpoint` to connect with a
           :ref:`private endpoint <private-endpoint>`, and then select
           a previously-configured private endpoint from the dropdown.
           Only private endpoints that are in ``AVAILABLE`` state are valid.
           If the :guilabel:`Private Endpoint` option is grayed out,
           :ref:`configure a private endpoint <private-endpoint>`
           before starting this procedure. To learn more, see
           :ref:`migrate-from-com-vpc-support`.

           .. note::

              .. include:: /includes/fact-private-endpoint-limitations-push-live-migration.rst

       - Click :guilabel:`Validate`. The validation process verifies that
         your migration host is reachable, and performs the following
         validation checks to ensure that you can start live migration
         to |service|.

         To take advantage of the following validation checks,
         :opsmgr:`upgrade the MongoDB Agent in Ops Manager
         </tutorial/update-mongodb-agent-from-automation-agent/>`, or
         :cloudmgr:`upgrade the MongoDB Agent in Cloud Manager 
         </tutorial/update-mongodb-agent-from-automation-agent/>` to
         the latest version.
         If the live migration process detects that the source cluster is
         running a version of MongoDB Agent earlier than 12.0.11.7606 for
         Ops Manager, or 12.5.0.7713 for |mms|, it displays a banner
         warning suggesting that you upgrade the MongoDB Agent.

         The following validation checks run during the live migration:

         - The migration host can connect to the destination {+cluster+}.
         - If the source cluster uses |tls-ssl| with a custom Root
           Certificate Authority (CA), the migration host can access
           the source cluster using |tls-ssl|.
         - The database user credentials are valid. This validation check
           runs only if you suspend the source cluster from automation in
           |com|, but continue to monitor the source cluster with the
           Monitoring Agent.

         - If you are migrating from |onprem| before version 5.0.9, the
           live migration process validates that the destination {+cluster+}
           has enough disk space based on the data size. If you are migrating
           from |mms| or |onprem| 5.0.9 or later, the migration process
           validates that the destination {+cluster+} has enough disk space
           based on the storage size of the compressed data. To learn more
           about data and storage sizes, see
           :manual:`dbStats </reference/command/dbStats/#output>`.

       - If validation fails, check the migration host, the validity of
         your external IP addresses or |cidr| block, and the link-token.
         Also check the database user credentials, your |tls-ssl|
         certificates, and the amount of disk storage size on the destination
         {+cluster+}.
       - If validation succeeds, click :guilabel:`Next`. The
         :guilabel:`Migrate from Ops Manager or Cloud Manager` page displays.

     A lag time value dispays during the final oplog tailing phase that
     represents the current lag between the source and destination {+clusters+}.
     This lag time may fluctuate depending on the rate of oplog generation
     on the source cluster, but should decrease over time as the live
     migration process copies the oplog entries to the destination {+cluster+}.

     a. When the lag timer and the :guilabel:`Prepare to Cutover` button
        turn green, click it to proceed to the next step.

  When |service| detects that the source and destination {+clusters+} are
  nearly in sync, it starts an extendable 120 hour (5 day) timer to
  begin the cutover stage of the live migration procedure. If the
  120 hour period passes, |service| stops synchronizing with the source
  {+cluster+}. You can extend the time remaining by 24 hours by clicking
  :guilabel:`Extend time` below the :guilabel:`<time> left to cut over`
  timer.

  To finish migrating your MongoDB data to your |service| {+cluster+},
  complete the following steps on the
  :guilabel:`Your migration is almost complete!` page:

  1. Prepare to point to your |service| {+cluster+}. Copy the new
     :manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string/>` so that
     you can update it and point your application to the destination
     |service| {+cluster+}.

  #. Stop your application. This action ensures that no more writes occur
     on the source {+cluster+}.

  #. Wait for the optime gap to reach zero. When the counter reaches zero,
     the source and destination {+clusters+} are in sync.

  #. Wait for additional time until |service| configures your destination
     {+cluster+} and it is ready to use. For smaller clusters, this time
     is 3-5 minutes. For larger clusters, this time can extend up to
     10 minutes or longer, depending on the {+cluster+} size and configuration.

  #. Restart your application using the new |service| connection
     string and confirm that your application is working with the
     |service| {+cluster+}.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Cut Over` to complete the migration process.

     If you click :guilabel:`Cancel` on the live migration progress bar,
     |service| stops synchronizing writes from the source {+cluster+}.
     All migrated data remains on your |service| {+cluster+}.

     You can click :guilabel:`Cut Over` again to allow |service| to
     complete the migration process.
