The :github:`MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator </mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes>`
creates |k8s| |k8s-statefulsets| from specification files that you
wrote.

MongoDB resources are created in Kubernetes as
:k8sdocs:`custom resources </concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/>`.
After you create or update a |k8s-mdbrsc| specification, you direct
|k8s-op-full| to apply this specification to your |k8s| environment.
|k8s-op-short| creates the defined |k8s-statefulsets|, services and
other Kubernetes resources. After the Operator finishes creating those
objects, it updates the |onprem-link| deployment configuration to
reflect changes.

.. list-table::

   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Deployment Type
     - StatefulSets
     - Size of StatefulSet

   * - Standalone

     - 1 |k8s-pod|

   * - Replica Set

     - 1 |k8s-pod| per member

   * - Sharded Cluster
     - <numberOfShards> + 2
     - 1 |k8s-pod| per |mongos|, shard, or config server member

Each |k8s-mdbrsc| uses an object specification in |yaml| to define the
characteristics and settings of the MongoDB object: standalone,
:term:`replica set`, and :term:`sharded cluster`.

Common Resource Settings

.. _prometheus-settings:

Prometheus Settings
-------------------

You can use Prometheus with your standalone resource, replica sets, or 
sharded clusters. To learn more, see :ref:`deploy-prometheus`. To view 
an example, see :ref:`mdb-resource-prometheus`.

The following settings apply when you use Prometheus 
with your MongoDB resource:

.. setting:: spec.prometheus

   *Optional*

   List that contains the parameters for exposing metrics to Prometheus.

.. setting:: spec.prometheus.metricsPath

   *Type*: string

   *Optional*

   *Default*: ``"/metrics"``

   Human-readable string that indicates the path to the metrics 
   endpoint. If you don't specify this setting, the default applies.

.. setting:: spec.prometheus.passwordSecretRef

   *Type*: object

   *Conditional*

   Object that contains the details of the |k8s-secret| for 
   basic HTTP authentication. If you want to use Prometheus with your 
   MongoDB resource, you must specify this setting.

.. setting:: spec.prometheus.passwordSecretRef.key

   *Type*: string

   *Optional*

   *Default*: ``"password"``

   Human-readable string that indentifies the key in the |k8s-secret| 
   that stores the password for basic HTTP authentication. If you don't 
   specify this setting, the default applies.

.. setting:: spec.prometheus.passwordSecretRef.name

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   Human-readable label that identifies the |k8s-secret| that contains 
   the password for basic HTTP authentication. If you want to use 
   Prometheus with your MongoDB resource, you must specify this setting.

.. setting:: spec.prometheus.port

   *Type*: integer

   *Optional*

   *Default:* 9216

   Number that identifies the port that the metrics endpoint will 
   bind to. If you don't specify this setting, the default applies.

.. setting:: spec.prometheus.tlseSecretKeyRef

   *Type*: object

   *Optional*

   Object that contains the details of the |k8s-secret| for |tls| 
   authentication.

.. setting:: spec.prometheus.tlseSecretKeyRef.key

   *Type*: string

   *Optional*

   *Default*: ``"password"``

   Human-readable string that indentifies the key in the |k8s-secret|

   specify this setting, the default applies.

.. setting:: spec.prometheus.tlseSecretKeyRef.name

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   Human-readable label that identifies the |k8s-secret| that contains 
   the password for |tls| authentication. If you want to use 
   Prometheus with your MongoDB resource and you want to use |tls| 
   authentication, you must specify this setting.

.. setting:: spec.prometheus.username

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   Human-readable label that identifies the user for basic HTTP 
   authentication. If you want to use Prometheus with your MongoDB 
   resource, you must specify this setting.

.. _statefulset-settings:

StatefulSet Settings
--------------------

The following |k8s-statefulsets| settings apply only to replica set and
sharded cluster resource types.

.. setting:: spec.statefulSet.spec

   *Type*: collection

   Specification for the |k8s-statefulset| that the |k8s-op| creates
   for |k8s-mdbrscs|.

.. setting:: spec.statefulSet.spec.serviceName

   *Type*: string

   *Default*: ``<resource_name>-svc`` and ``<resource_name>-svc-external``

   Name of the |k8s| service to be created or used for a
   |k8s-statefulset|. If the service with this name already exists, the
   |k8s-op-full| does not delete or recreate it. This setting lets
   you create your own custom services and lets the |k8s-op-short|
   reuse them.
