   :description: Secure your MongoDB instance by configuring a firewall and enabling authentication to prevent exposure to the public Internet.

The MongoDB instance running on ``host X`` in ``rsY`` is exposed to the
public Internet.

Alert Conditions
----------------

You can configure alert conditions in the project-level 
:ref:`alert settings <configure-alerts>` page to trigger alerts.

To learn more about the alert condition, see 
:ref:`Host is exposed to the public Internet <host-alert-conditions>`.

Common Triggers
---------------

- The :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` or :manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos>` process was reached
  because it is not behind a firewall and does not have authentication
  enabled.

Fix the Immediate Problem
-------------------------

- Install and configure a firewall between the public Internet and your
  MongoDB instance.

  To review which ports need to be available to your |mms| deployment, 
  see :doc:`/reference/firewall-configuration`.

- Enable authentication for the instance. You can choose from the 
  following options:

  - :doc:`/tutorial/enable-mongodbcr-authentication-for-group`

  - :doc:`/tutorial/enable-ldap-authentication-for-group`

  - :doc:`/tutorial/enable-kerberos-authentication-for-group`

  - :doc:`/tutorial/enable-x509-authentication-for-group`

Implement a Long-Term Solution
------------------------------

:manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` or :manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos>` process behind a firewall and 
enable authentication.

Monitor Your Progress

  Monitor connections to determine whether the current connection 
  limits are sufficient.
