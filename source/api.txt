The |cloudgov| |api| functions in the same way as the |service| |api|, 
except that it uses the following base URL:

.. code-block:: shell

   https://cloud.mongodbgov.com/api/atlas/v1.0

|cloudgov-short| authenticates |api| requests with ``SHA-256`` using 
:atlas:`HTTP Digest Authentication </api/#std-label-api-authentication>`.

Example Usage
-------------

This ``curl`` example retrieves database users for a project:

.. code-block:: shell

   curl --user "{PUBLIC-KEY}:{PRIVATE-KEY}" --digest \
     --header "Accept: application/json" \
     --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --include \
     --request GET "https://cloud.mongodbgov.com/api/atlas/v1.0/groups/{PROJECT-ID}/databaseUsers?pretty=true"

- You can find your ``PROJECT-ID`` in your :guilabel:`Project Settings`.

- You can generate an |api| key pair in your organization's 
  :guilabel:`Access Manager`, under the :guilabel:`API Keys` tab.

See the Atlas Documentation
---------------------------

- To learn more about using the |api|, see the 
  :atlas:`Atlas API </api/>`.

- To configure the API, see 
  :atlas:`Configure Atlas API Access </configure-api-access/>`.

- For a list of possible errors, see 
  :atlas:`Atlas API Error Codes </reference/api/api-errors/>`.
