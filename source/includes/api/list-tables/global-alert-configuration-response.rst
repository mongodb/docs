     - Description

   * - ``created``
     - string
     - |iso8601-time| when the alert configuration was created.

     - boolean
     - Toggle that specifies whether the alert configuration is enabled.

   * - ``eventTypeName``
     - string
     - Type of event for which this alert configuration triggers
       an alert.

   * - ``forAllGroups``
     - boolean
     - Toggle that specifies whether the global alert configuration 
       applies to all groups. Also affects whether you can use the 
       ``tags`` array to target the configuration to specific groups.

       If ``true``, the configuration applies to all groups. You can 
       target the alert configuration to specific groups through the 
       ``tags`` array.

       If ``false``, the configuration applies only to the groups
       specified in the ``groupIds`` array. You must specify at 
       least one project in the ``groupIds`` array. You can't use the 
       ``tags`` array for this alert configuration.

   * - ``groupIds``

   * - ``matchers``
     - array of objects
     - Rules to apply when matching an object against this global alert
       configuration. |mms| only checks entities that match *all* these

       You can filter using the ``matchers`` array only when the
       ``eventTypeName`` specifies an event for a host, replica set, or
       sharded cluster.

     - Threshold value outside of which this alert configuration
       triggers an alert.

   * - ``metricThreshold.units``
     - string
     - Units for ``metricThreshold.threshold``. The value depends on
       the type of metric. 

       .. example::

          A metric that measures memory consumption has a byte 
          measurement, while a metric that measures time has a time 
          unit.
