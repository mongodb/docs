   There are two mutually exclusive options for shard keys:

   - Check :guilabel:`hashed` if you want to use a
     :manual:`hashed </core/hashed-sharding>` shard key.
   - Check :guilabel:`Enforce Unique Key` if you want to have unique key
     names.

   A Shard Key cannot be unique *and* hashed.

   - You may hash up to one key in a compound shard key.
   
   - Check :guilabel:`Enforce Unique Key` if you want to have unique key
     names.

   A compound shard key cannot include more than three keys.

   .. important::
      
      Hashing a compound shard key is supported starting in MongoDB 
      version 4.4. If you hash a compound shard key and want to 
      downgrade to |fcv-link| 4.2, you must first drop the sharded 
      collection with a hashed key.
