The MongoDB |version| Manual
============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Welcome to the MongoDB |version| Manual! MongoDB is a
document database designed for ease of development and scaling. The
Manual introduces key concepts in MongoDB, presents the query language,
and provides operational and administrative considerations and
procedures as well as a comprehensive reference section. The manual is
also available as :hardlink:`HTML tar.gz <manual.tar.gz>` and
:hardlink:`EPUB <MongoDB-manual.epub>`.

MongoDB offers both a *Community* and an *Enterprise* version of the
database:

- MongoDB Community is the {+source-available+} edition of MongoDB.

- MongoDB Enterprise is available as part of the MongoDB Enterprise
  Advanced subscription and includes comprehensive support for your
  MongoDB deployment. MongoDB Enterprise also adds enterprise-focused
  features such as LDAP and Kerberos support, on-disk encryption,
  and auditing.

MongoDB also offers
`Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?jmp=docs_server>`__,
a hosted MongoDB Enterprise service option in the cloud which requires
no installation overhead and offers a free tier to get started.

The Manual documents both MongoDB Community and Enterprise features and
functionality.
