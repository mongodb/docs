      * - Field

        - Contents

      * - :guilabel:`<hostname>:<port>`

        - Type the :manual:`hostname and port number </reference/connection-string/>` 
          of the MongoDB database.

      * - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Username` (Optional)

        - If the database uses authentication, type the name of the user
          authorized to access the database.

      * - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Password` (Optional)

        - If the database uses authentication, type the password of the
          user authorized to access the database.

      * - :guilabel:`Encrypted Credentials` (Optional)

        - If you :ref:`encrypted the username and password <encrypt-user-credentials>` 
          using the ``credentialstool``, select this checkbox.

      * - :guilabel:`Use SSL` (Optional)

        - If the database uses SSL, select this checkbox.

      * - :guilabel:`Connection Options` (Optional)

        - Type any additional :manual:`configuration file options </reference/configuration-options>`
          for the MongoDB instance. This field supports unescaped values only.

      * - :guilabel:`Assignment Labels` (Optional)

        - Type a comma-separated list of labels to assign the
          blockstores to specific groups.

      * - :guilabel:`Load Factor` (Optional)

        - 
          .. note::
             Load Factor depends upon having more than one snapshot 
             store, particularly when backing up a sharded cluster.
             If you do not have more than one snapshot store, this
             setting can be ignored.

          Type how many backup jobs this snapshot store is assigned.

          You should distribute backup jobs proportionally among snapshot
          stores. Snapshots stores with more instances to back up should have
          a greater number of backup jobs. The number of backup jobs given to
          a single snapshot store is known as its *Load Factor*.

          By default, |mms| assigns snapshot stores one shard each.

          If you assign more than one shard to a snapshot store, this 
          snapshot store would need to run more backup jobs, usually by a 
          factor of how many shards it backs up.

          .. example:: **How the Load Factor affects backups**

             You are backing up a five-shard cluster. Your backup storage
             configuration has filestore (``A``) with one shard and 
             blockstore (``B``) with four shards. These blockstores should 
             not get equally distribution of backup jobs, as ``B`` is four 
             times larger than ``A``. ``B`` should get a Load Factor of 
             *four* and ``A`` should get a Load Factor of *one*.

          You should change the Load Factor to change this ratio of backup
          jobs to match the number of shards being backed up.


      * - :guilabel:`Write Concern`

        - Select the proper :manual:`Write Concern</core/write-concern/>`.
