Database User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To access a {+database-deployment+}, you must create a
:manual:`database user </core/security-users/>` with access to the
desired databases on your |service| {+database-deployment+}. Database users are
separate from |service| users. Database users have access to MongoDB
databases, while |service| users have access to the |service|
application itself.

You can create a database user to access your |service| {+database-deployment+} in
the :guilabel:`Connect` dialog. You can also add the database user from
the :ref:`{+Database-Deployment+} view <mongodb-users>`.
