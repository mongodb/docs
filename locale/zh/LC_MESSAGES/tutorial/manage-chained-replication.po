"Starting in version 2.0, MongoDB supports chained replication. A chained "
"replication occurs when a :term:`secondary` member replicates from another "
"secondary member instead of from the :term:`primary`. This might be the "
"case, for example, if a secondary selects its replication target based on "
"ping time and if the closest member is another secondary."
msgstr ""
"自2.0版本之后，MongoDB开始支持链式复制。当 :term:`secondary`  从其他从节点上"
"进行复制而不是 :term:`primary` 的时候，就发生了链式复制。当从节点根据节点之间"
"的ping值来进行选取的时候，最近的从节点可能会被选中，从而产生链式复制。"
