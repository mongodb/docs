.. note:: Release Notes Mention Only Releases with Feature Changes

   MongoDB releases {+asql+} drivers and connectors in a continuous deployment 
   manner. This release cadence allows us to continuously improve {+asql+} 
   Interface performance and stability. These release notes capture only those 
   releases that contain direct user feature changes. If a particular {+asql+} 
   release contains only performance and stability improvements, it is not included 
   in these release notes.

*Released December 6, 2024*

- Updates the Tableau custom connector (for the MongoDB JDBC driver) to
  version 1.4.0.
- Moves the logging information UI for the Tableau Connector into an
  :guilabel:`Advanced` tab.

*Released August 15, 2024*

- Releases version 2.2.0 of the JDBC driver.
- Introduces driver support for jBoss Log Manager for logging.
- Updates UUID string representation to the extended json uuid format 
  ``{$uuid : "val"}`` instead of the generic base64 binary data format 
  ``{ "$binary":{"base64": "base64val", "subType": "xx"}``.
  For ``subType 03``, you can use the :manual:`uuidRepresentation 
  </reference/connection-string/#mongodb-urioption-urioption.uuidRepresentation>` connection option.

*Released July 8, 2024*

- Introduces |oidc| authentication for the |odbc| driver.
- Updates the |odbc| driver to version 1.4.1.
- Adds conversion support for ``wlongvarchar`` and ``wvarcchar`` in
  the |odbc| driver.
- Addresses the low and medium static code analysis findings for the
  |odbc| driver.

*Released June 27, 2024*

- Updates the |jdbc| driver to version 2.1.4.
- Updates the |odbc| driver to version 1.3.4.
- Publishes checksum for validating the signed msi for |odbc|.

*Released June 24, 2024*

- Updates the Tableau custom connector (for the MongoDB JDBC driver) to 
  version 1.3.0.

  - ``Certificate / Token``

  If you choose ``Certificate / Token``, the username and password are not required.

- Updates the |odbc| driver to version 1.3.3.
- Adds a checkbox on the |odbc| driver DSN configuration UI to 
  indicate whether to limit the maximum string length to 4000 
  characters. To work with BI tools, like Microsoft SQL Server 
  Linked Server, which can't handle variable length 
  string data with no known maximum length, you must enable this option.
 
*Released April 24, 2024*

- Updates the |jdbc| driver to version 2.1.2, which now 
  ignores both "true" and "false" ``setAutoCommit``
  values instead of returning an exception when "true".

*Released April 22, 2024*

- Updates the |odbc| driver to version 1.3.0.
- Adds support for result set data column-wise binding.
- Adds support for SQLCancel.
- Changes the non-standard data type
  (such as ``document`` and ``oid``)
  default mapping from ``SQL_UNKNOWN_TYPE`` to
  ``SQL_WVARCHAR``. This change affects only programmatic 
  integrations relying on SQL type names; it doesn't affect Power BI.

*Released March 4, 2024*

- Updates the Power BI connector to version 1.2.0.
- Adds support for Direct Query. Direct Query capabilities require
  |odbc| driver version 1.2.0 or later.

- Updates the |odbc| driver to version 1.2.0.
- Adds support for |odbc| clients requesting the driver to exhibit |odbc| 2.0 behavior.
- Adds support for ``SQLFreeStatement``.
- Adds support for ``SQLFetchScroll``.
- The column order in result sets now adheres to the SQL-92 specification.
  Result set columns appear in the order they are listed in the ``SELECT`` query.
  For ``SELECT *``, the result set column order is unchanged. 
- Updates the information returned by ``SQLGetInfo``
  to report all supported date functions, time functions, and join capabilities.
- Removes log level configuration at the DSN and connection level. 
  The log level can now only be set as a driver property.
- Changes the |bson|-to-SQL mapping of ``Decimal128`` from 
  ``SQL_DECIMAL`` to ``SQL_UNKNOWN`` due to
  incompatibilities between ``Decimal128`` and ``SQL_DECIMAL``.

*Released February 23, 2024*

- Updates the |jdbc| driver to version 2.1.1, which removes
  the SnakeYaml dependency and fixes an issue introduced in version 2.1.0
  where data retrieved by column name
  was pointing to the incorrect index. The driver now retrieves the data under 
  the correct index or reports an error if there are duplicate column names.

*Released January 22, 2024*

- Updates the |jdbc| driver to version 2.1.0, which returns result set
  columns in the same order as the one provided in the select list instead

  handlers and not other applications handlers.
