Overview
--------

One of the benefits of MongoDB's rich schema model is the ability to
store arrays as document field values. Storing arrays as field values
allows you to model one-to-many or many-to-many relationships in a
single document, instead of across separate collections as you might in
a relational database.

However, you should exercise caution if you are consistently adding
elements to arrays in your documents. If you do not limit the number of
elements in an array, your documents may grow to an unpredictable size.
As an array continues to grow, reading and building indexes on that
array gradually decrease in performance. A large, growing array can
strain application resources and put your documents at risk of exceeding
the :limit:`BSON Document Size` limit.

Instead, consider bounding your arrays to improve performance and keep
your documents a manageable size.

Example
-------

Consider the following schema for a ``publishers`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   // publishers collection
   {
     "_id": "orielly"
     "name": "O'Reilly Media",
     "founded": 1980,
     "location": "CA",
     "books": [
       {
         "_id": 123456789,
         "title": "MongoDB: The Definitive Guide",
         "author": [ "Kristina Chodorow", "Mike Dirolf" ],
         "published_date": ISODate("2010-09-24"),
         "pages": 216,
         "language": "English"
       },
       {
         "_id": 234567890,
         "title": "50 Tips and Tricks for MongoDB Developer",
         "author": "Kristina Chodorow",
         "published_date": ISODate("2011-05-06"),
         "pages": 68,
         "language": "English"
       }
     ]
   }

In this scenario, the ``books`` array is *unbounded*. Each new book
released by this publishing company adds a new sub-document to the
``books`` array. As publishing companies continue to release books, the
documents will eventually grow very large and cause a disproportionate
amount of memory strain on the application.

To avoid mutable, unbounded arrays, separate the ``publishers``
collection into two collections, one for ``publishers`` and one for
``books``. Instead of embedding the entire ``book`` document in the
``publishers`` document, include a
:manual:`reference </core/data-model-design/#data-modeling-referencing>`
to the publisher inside of the book document:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   // publishers collection
   {
     "_id": "oreilly"
     "name": "O'Reilly Media",
     "founded": 1980,
     "location": "CA"
   }

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 9,19
   
   // books collection
   {
     "_id": 123456789,
     "title": "MongoDB: The Definitive Guide",
     "author": [ "Kristina Chodorow", "Mike Dirolf" ],
     "published_date": ISODate("2010-09-24"),
     "pages": 216,
     "language": "English",
     "publisher_id": "oreilly"
   }

   {
     "_id": 234567890,
     "title": "50 Tips and Tricks for MongoDB Developer",
     "author": "Kristina Chodorow",
     "published_date": ISODate("2011-05-06"),
     "pages": 68,
     "language": "English",
     "publisher_id": "oreilly"
   }   

This updated schema removes the unbounded array in the ``publishers``
collection and places a reference to the publisher in each book document
using the ``publisher_id`` field. This ensures that each document has a
manageable size, and there is no risk of a document field growing
abnormally large.

Document References May Require ``$lookups``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This approach works especially well if your application loads the book
and publisher information separately. If your application requires the
book and information together, it needs to perform a :pipeline:`$lookup`
operation to join the data from the ``publishers`` and ``books``
collections. :pipeline:`$lookup` operations are not very performant, but
in this scenario may be worth the trade off to avoid unbounded arrays.
