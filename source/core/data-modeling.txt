Overview
--------

Data in MongoDB has a *flexible schema*. :term:`Collections
<collection>` do not enforce :term:`document` structure. This means
that:

- documents in the same collection do not need to have the same set of
  fields or structure, and

- common fields in a collection's documents may hold different types
  of data.

Each document only needs to contain relevant fields to the entity or
object that the document represents. In practice, *most* documents in a
collection share a similar structure. Schema flexibility means that
you can model your documents in MongoDB so that they can closely
resemble and reflect application-level objects.

As in all data modeling, when developing data models (i.e. *schema
designs,*) for MongoDB you must consider the inherent properties and
requirements of the application objects and the relationships between
application objects. MongoDB data models must also reflect:

- how data will grow and change over time, and

- the kinds of queries your application will perform.

These considerations and requirements force developers to make a
number of multi-factored decisions when modeling data, including:

- normalization and de-normalization.

  These decisions reflect degree to which the data model should store
  related pieces of data in a single document **or** should the data
  model describe relationships using :doc:`references
  </applications/database-references>` between documents.

- :doc:`indexing strategy </applications/indexes>`.

- representation of data in arrays in :term:`BSON`.

Although a number of data models may be functionally equivalent for a
given application; however, different data models may have significant
impacts on MongoDB and applications performance.

This document provides a high level overview of these data modeling
decisions and factors. In addition, consider, the
:ref:`data-modeling-examples` section which provides more concrete
examples of all the discussed patterns.

.. _data-modeling-decisions:

Data Modeling Decisions
-----------------------

Data modeling decisions involve determining how to structure the
documents to model the data effectively. The primary decision is
whether to :ref:`embed <data-modeling-embedding>` or to :ref:`use
references <data-modeling-referencing>`.

.. _data-modeling-embedding:

Embedding
~~~~~~~~~

To de-normalize data, store two related pieces of data in a single
:term:`document`.

Operations within a document are less expensive for the server than
operations that involve multiple documents.

In general, use embedded data models when:

- you have "contains" relationships between entities. See
  :ref:`data-modeling-example-one-to-one`.

- you have one-to-many relationships where the "many" objects always
  appear with or are viewed in the context of their parent documents.
  See :ref:`data-modeling-example-one-to-many`.

Embedding provides the following benefits:

- generally better performance for read operations.

- the ability to request and retrieve related data in a single
  database operation.

Embedding related data in documents, can lead to situations where
documents grow after creation. Document growth can impact write
performance and lead to data fragmentation. Furthermore, documents in
MongoDB must be smaller than the :limit:`maximum BSON document size
<BSON Document Size>`. For larger documents, consider using
:doc:`GridFS </applications/gridfs>`.

.. seealso::

   - :term:`dot notation` for information on "reaching into" embedded
     sub-documents.

   - :ref:`read-operations-arrays` for more examples on accessing arrays.

   - :ref:`read-operations-subdocuments` for more examples on accessing
     subdocuments.

.. _data-modeling-referencing:

Referencing
~~~~~~~~~~~

To normalize data, store :doc:`references
</applications/database-references>` between two documents to indicate
a relationship between the data represented in each document.

In general, use normalized data models:

- when embedding would result in duplication of data but would not
  provide sufficient read performance advantages to outweigh the
  implications of the duplication.

- to represent more complex many-to-many relationships.

- to model large hierarchical data sets. See :ref:`data-modeling-trees`.

Referencing provides more flexibility than embedding; however, to
resolve the references, client-side applications must issue follow-up
queries. In other words, using references requires more roundtrips to
the server.

See :ref:`data-modeling-publisher-and-books` for an example of
referencing.

.. _data-modeling-atomicity:

Atomicity
~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB only provides atomic operations on the level of a single
document. [#record-atomicity]_ As a result needs for atomic operations influence decisions
to use embedded or referenced relationships when modeling data for
MongoDB.

Embed fields that need to be modified together atomically in the same
document. See :ref:`data-modeling-atomic-operation` for an example of
atomic updates within a single document.

.. [#record-atomicity] Document-level atomic operations include all
   operations within a single MongoDB document record: operations that
   affect multiple sub-documents within that single record are still
   atomic.

Operational Considerations
--------------------------

In addition to normalization and normalization concerns, a number of
other operational factors help shape data modeling decisions in
MongoDB. These factors include:

- data lifecycle management,
- number of collections and
- indexing requirements,
- sharding, and
- managing document growth.

These factors implications for database and application performance
as well as future maintenance and development costs.

Data Lifecycle Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data modeling decisions should also take data lifecycle management into
consideration.

The :doc:`Time to Live or TTL feature </tutorial/expire-data>` of
collections expires documents after a period of time. Consider using
the TTL feature if your application requires some data to persist in
the database for a limited period of time.

Additionally, if your application only uses recently inserted
documents consider :doc:`/core/capped-collections`.  Capped
collections provide *first-in-first-out* (FIFO) management of inserted
documents and optimized to support operations that insert and read
documents based on insertion order.

.. _data-model-large-number-of-collections:

Large Number of Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In certain situations, you might choose to store information in several
collections rather than in a single collection.

Consider a sample collection ``logs`` that stores log documents for
various environment and applications. The ``logs`` collection contains
documents of the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { log: "dev", ts: ..., info: ... }
   { log: "debug", ts: ..., info: ...}

If the total number of documents is low you may group documents into
collection by type. For logs, consider maintaining distinct log
collections, such as ``logs.dev`` and ``logs.debug``. The ``logs.dev``
collection would contain only the documents related to the dev
environment.

Generally, having large number of collections has no significant
performance penalty and results in very good performance. Distinct
collections are very important for high-throughput batch processing.

When using models that have a large number of collections, consider
the following behaviors:

- Each collection has a certain minimum overhead of a few kilobytes.

- Each index, including the index on ``_id``, requires at least 8KB of
  data space.

A single ``<database>.ns`` file stores all meta-data for each
:term:`database`. Each index and collection has its own entry in the
namespace file, MongoDB places :limit:`limits on the size of namespace
files <Size of Namespace File>`.

Because of :limit:`limits on namespaces <Number of Namespaces>`, you
may wish to know the current number of namespaces in order to determine
how many additional namespaces the database can support, as in the
following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.system.namespaces.count()

The ``<database>.ns`` file defaults to 16 MB. To change
the size of the ``<database>.ns`` file, pass a new size to
:option:`--nssize option \<new size MB\> <mongod --nssize>` on server
start.

.. todo make a tutorial called "how to change size of namespace file"

The :option:`--nssize <mongod --nssize>` sets the size for *new*
``<database>.ns`` files. For existing databases, after starting up the
server with :option:`--nssize <mongod --nssize>`, run the
:method:`db.repairDatabase()` command from the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
shell.

Indexes
~~~~~~~

Create indexes to support common queries. Generally, indexes and index
use in MongoDB correspond to indexes and index use in relational
database: build indexes on fields that appear often in queries and for
all operations that return sorted results. MongoDB automatically
creates a unique index on the ``_id`` field.

As you create indexes, consider the following behaviors of indexes:

- Each index requires at least 8KB of data space.

- Adding an index has some negative performance impact for write
  operations. For collections with high write-to-read ratio, indexes
  are expensive as each insert must add keys to each index.

- Collections with high proportion of read operations to write
  operations often benefit from additional indexes. Indexes do not
  affect un-indexed read operations.

See :doc:`/applications/indexes` for more information on determining
indexes. Additionally, the MongoDB :doc:`database profiler
</tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler>` may help identify
inefficient queries.

Sharding
~~~~~~~~

:term:`Sharding` allows users to :term:`partition` a
:term:`collection` within a database to distribute the collection's
documents across a number of :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances or
:term:`shards <shard>`.

The shard key determines how MongoDB distributes data among shards in
a sharded collection. Selecting the proper :ref:`shard key
<shard-key>` has significant implications for performance.

See :doc:`/core/sharded-clusters` for more information on sharding and
the selection of the :ref:`shard key <shard-key>`.

Document Growth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain updates to documents can increase the document size, such as
pushing elements to an array and adding new fields. If the document
size exceeds the allocated space for that document, MongoDB relocates
the document on disk. This internal relocation can be both time and
resource consuming.

Although MongoDB automatically provides padding to minimize the
occurrence of relocations, you may still need to manually handle
document growth. Refer to :ecosystem:`Pre-Aggregated Reports Use Case
Study </use-cases/pre-aggregated-reports>` for an example of the
*Pre-allocation* approach to handle document growth.
