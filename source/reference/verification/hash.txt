You can verify sync by comparing MD5 hashes of collections synced from the
source cluster to the destination cluster. While hash comparison ensures
that the destination cluster has received all changes from the source, the
:dbcommand:`dbHash` command locks the cluster, preventing additional writes
until it completes.  This process can also be much slower than verification 
using :ref:`document counts <c2c-verify-doc-counts>`.

About This Task
---------------

Hash comparison is not possible with sharded clusters. It also does not
work for standalone servers and replica sets that use MongoDB 4.4 or earlier
releases, since the document field order can vary.

If you need to sync a sharded cluster or an older release of MongoDB, or
if the locks are unacceptable for your application workload, use a different
:ref:`verification method <c2c-verify-method>`.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Retrieve the Source Hash

      Run the :dbcommand:`dbHash` command on the source cluster.
      In the ``collections`` field, list each collection included
      in the sync. Then, return the ``md5`` output field:

      .. io-code-block::

         .. input::
            :language: javascript

            db.runCommand({
               dbHash: 1,
               collections: [
                  "accounts.us_accounts",
                  "accounts.eu_accounts",
                  ...
               ]}).md5

         .. output::
            :language: text

            d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e

      While running this command, retrieve the destination hash.

   .. _c2c-retrieve-dest-hash:

   .. step:: Retrieve the Destination Hash

      Run the :dbcommand:`dbHash` command on the destination cluster.
      In the ``collections`` field, list each collection included
      in the sync. Then, return the ``md5`` output field:

      .. io-code-block::

         .. input::
            :language: javascript

            db.runCommand({
               dbHash: 1,
               collections: [
                  "accounts.us_accounts",
                  "accounts.eu_accounts",
                  ...
               ]}).md5

         .. output::
            :language: text

            d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e

      Note the hash.

   .. step:: Compare the Hashes

      Compare the ``md5`` values from each cluster. If both clusters return
      the same MD5 value, the sync was successful.
