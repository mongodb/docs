.. dbcommand:: setIndexCommitQuorum

   The ``setIndexCommitQuorum`` command sets minimum number of
   data-bearing members that must be prepared to commit their local
   index builds before the primary node will commit the index.

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-all.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      { 
        setIndexCommitQuorum: <string>,
        indexNames: [ <document> ],
        commitQuorum: <int> | <string>,
        comment: <any>
      }     
   )

Command Fields
--------------

The command takes the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60
 
   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
 
   * - :ref:`setIndexCommitQuorum <setIndexCommitQuorum-cmd-coll>`
     - ``string``
     - .. _setIndexCommitQuorum-cmd-coll:
       
       The name of the collection for which the indexes are being 
       built.
 
   * - :ref:`indexNames <setIndexCommitQuorum-cmd-indexNames>`
     - ``array``
     - .. _setIndexCommitQuorum-cmd-indexNames:
     
       An array of in-progress index builds to modify. Each 
       element of the array must be the *name* of the index. 
      
       The indexes specified to ``indexNames`` must be the entire set
       of in-progress builds associated to a given index builder,
       i.e. the indexes built by a single :dbcommand:`createIndexes`
       or :method:`db.collection.createIndexes()` operation.
 
   * - :ref:`commitQuorum <setIndexCommitQuorum-cmd-commitQuorum>`
     - ``int`` or ``string``
     - .. _setIndexCommitQuorum-cmd-commitQuorum:
     
       The minimum number of data-bearing replica
       set members (i.e. commit quorum), including the primary, that
       must report a successful :ref:`index build
       <index-operations-replicated-build>` before the primary
       marks the ``indexes`` as ready.
       
       Starting in MongoDB v5.0, it's possible to resume some
       :ref:`interrupted index builds <index-operations-build-failure>`
       when the commit quorum is set to ``"votingMembers"``. 
       
       To update the commitQuorum, member replica set nodes must have
       :rsconf:`members[n].buildIndexes` set to ``true``. If any voting
       nodes have ``members[n].buildIndexes`` 
       set to ``false``, you can't use the default ``"votingMembers"`` commit 
       quorum. Either configure all nodes with ``members[n].buildIndexes`` 
       set to ``true``, or select a different commit quorum. 
 
       Supports the following values:
 
       - ``"votingMembers"`` - all data-bearing voting replica set
         members (*Default*). A "voting" member is any replica set member 
         where :rsconf:`members[n].votes` is greater than ``0``.
 
       - ``"majority"`` - a simple majority of data-bearing
         replica set members.
 
       - ``<int>`` - a specific number of data-bearing 
         replica set members. Specify an integer greater than 
         ``0``.
 
       - A replica set :doc:`tag name
         </tutorial/configure-replica-set-tag-sets>`.
 
 
   * - ``comment``
     - any

Behavior
--------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-index-builds-simultaneous-fcv.rst

.. include:: /includes/indexes/commit-quorum.rst

Issuing :dbcommand:`setIndexCommitQuorum` has no effect on index builds
started with :ref:`commitQuorum <createIndexes-cmd-commitQuorum>` of
``0``. 

.. important:: 

   Replica set nodes with :ref:`buildIndexes <replica-set-configuration-buildIndexes>` 
   set to ``false`` can't be included in a commit quorum.

Commit Quorum Contrasted with Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/indexes/commit-quorum-vs-write-concern.rst


Examples
--------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-index-builds-simultaneous.rst

The following operation starts an index build of two indexes:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("examples").invoices.createIndexes(
     [
       { "invoices" : 1 },
       { "fulfillmentStatus" : 1 }
     ]
   )

By default, index builds use ``"votingMembers"`` commit quorum, or all
data-bearing voting replica set members. The following operation
modifies the index build commit quorum to ``"majority"``, or a 
simple majority of data-bearing voting members:. 

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("examples").runCommand(
     {
       "setIndexCommitQuorum" : "invoices", 
       "indexNames" : ["invoices_1", "fullfillmentStatus_1"], 
       "commitQuorum" : "majority"
     }
   )

- The indexes specified to ``indexNames`` must be the entire set
  of in-progress builds associated to a given index builder, 
  i.e. the :method:`~db.collection.createIndexes()` operation. 

- The ``indexNames`` field specifies the *names* of the indexes. Since
  the indexes were created without an explicit name, MongoDB generated
  an index name by concatenating the names of the indexed fields and the
  sort order.
