title: "Clone a repo similar to the repository you wish to create."
ref: clone-repo
content: |

  First, clone a repository that is similar to the repository you wish to create.

  For this example, we will clone the docs-meta repository. Clone the repo to the name you wish to give your new repo.

  .. code-block:: sh

     git clone git@github.com:mongodb/docs-meta.git <docs-yourrepo>


  Run:

  .. code-block:: sh

     cd <docs-yourrepo>

---
title: Delete the .git directory
ref: delete-git
content: |



  Delete the .git directory in your local, cloned version of the repository so that you can begin with your own repository.

  .. code-block:: sh

     rm -rf .git

  Check to make sure you have deleted the .git file:

  .. code-block:: sh

     git branch

  You should see the following error:

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false

     fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git


---
title: Check to make sure you have removed the .git directory
ref: check-rm
content: |
  Before you proceed, check to make sure that .git directory is gone by running ls:

  .. code-block:: sh

     ls -al

  Your output should be something like:

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false

     total 32
     drwxr-xr-x   7 you  staff   238 Mar 11 05:05 .
     drwxr-xr-x  85 you  staff  2890 Mar 11 05:02 ..
     -rw-r--r--   1 you  staff  2424 Mar 11 05:02 .gitignore
     -rw-r--r--   1 you  staff  2243 Mar 11 05:02 Makefile
     -rw-r--r--   1 you  staff  7087 Mar 11 05:02 conf.py
     drwxr-xr-x   8 you  staff   272 Mar 11 05:02 config
     drwxr-xr-x  17 you  staff   578 Mar 11 05:02 source

---
title: Reinitialize the repo
ref: git-reinit
content: |
  Run git init to reinitialize the repo:

  .. code-block:: sh

     git init

  You will see the following output:

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false

     Initialized empty Git repository in <yourdirectorystructure>/docs-yourrepo/.git/

  Check your work:

  .. code-block:: sh

     ls -al

  The new .git directory should now appear.

---
title: Create the repository on GitHub
ref: create-repo
content: |

  Create the repo you would like to use on GitHub.

  You will then need to commit some files and add your local repository to github. If you add all of the files, you will
  need to remove the ones that are not relevant to your repository later, but this is a perfectly acceptable way to start your repository.

  Make sure you add a README.md file to your repo. Add a sentence to the file to describe your project. Then save the file and run:

  .. code-block:: sh

     git add README.md
     git commit -m "first commit"
     git remote add origin git@github.com:mongodb/docs-yourrepo.git
     git push -u origin master

---

title: Fork the repo
ref: fork-repo
content: |

  Go ahead and fork the repo on github if you wish to follow the docs model of github usage. `Fork a repo <https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo>`_.

  This is not a requirement if your team follows a different workflow. If you wish to branch off the root repository, skip this step entirely.

  Add the origin remote for your forked repo:

  .. code-block:: sh

     git remote add origin https://github.com/<fork>/docs-yourrepo

  Add the upstream remote:

  .. code-block:: sh

     git remote add upstream https://github.com/<repoOwner>/<remoteRepoRoot>.git
---
title: Remove the redirects file
ref: remove-redirects
content: |

  Some of our repositories have a ``redirects`` file that redirects browsers permanently to a new location.

  Please remove the file in order to prevent inadvertant redirects on your site.

  In the config directory of your repo, run:

  .. code-block:: sh

     rm redirects


---
title: Edit conf.py
ref: edit-confpy
content: |

  Edit the conf.py as needed. ``conf.py`` is where you can add sphinx extensions and roles that you might require for your docs.

  If you'd like to accept the default ``conf.py``, that's fine too.

---
title: Edit config/sphinx_local.yaml
ref: edit-local
content: |

  In this ``config/sphinx_local.yaml`` file, you will want to change the name of the project:

  .. code-block:: sh

     project: 'mongodb-<yoursitename>'

---

title: Edit config/build_conf.yaml
ref: edit-buildconf
content: |

  In order to make sure that your builds go to the right location on staging and production, modify the ``config/build_conf.yaml`` file.

  - Modify the git/remote section to reflect your repository.
  - Modify the project name to match the name of your project.
  - Modify the url and tag in the project section.

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false

     git:
       remote:
         upstream: 'mongodb/docs-yourrepo'
         tools: 'mongodb/docs-tools'
     project:
       name: 'yourprojectname'
       tag: 'ypt'
       url: 'https://www.mongodb.com/docs/projectname'
       title: 'MongoDB Project Documentation'
       branched: false


---
title: Install Build Tools
ref: install-build
content: |

  You will need to :doc:`install the build tools </tutorials/install>` in order to build your repository.

  Once you have installed the build tools, you can attempt to build your repository.

---
title: Running a Build Locally
ref: run-build
content: |

  If you are simply planning to build locally, you can build your repository by running:

  .. code-block:: sh

     make html

  You will see output pertaining to your build in the ``build/<branch>`` directory local to your repository.
