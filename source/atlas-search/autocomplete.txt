.. expression:: autocomplete

   .. include:: /includes/fts/facts/fact-autocomplete-operator.rst

.. note:: 

   |fts| might return inaccurate results for queries with more than 
   three words in a single string.

.. _autocomplete-sample-use-cases:

Sample Use Cases 
----------------

You can use the ``autocomplete`` operator with search-as-you-type
applications to predict words with increasing accuracy as characters are
entered in your application's search field. ``autocomplete`` returns
results that contain predicted words based on the tokenization strategy
specified in the index definition for autocompletion. 

If you want to build suggestions or dropdowns using the |fts| 
``autocomplete`` operator, we recommend that you query a
collection of suggested search terms or use past search terms to
populate the dropdown. If you create a separate collection of suggested
search terms, you can :ref:`define synonym mappings in your Atlas Search index <synonyms-ref>` to search your collection for 
the exact or alternative words. You can :ref:`track <fts-tracking-ref>`
search terms and :ref:`view metrics <fts-query-analytics>` for search
terms to build your collection.

.. _autocomplete-ref-syntax:

Syntax
------

``autocomplete`` has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: json
   :linenos:

   {
     $search: {
       "index": "<index name>", // optional, defaults to "default"
       "autocomplete": {
         "query": "<search-string>",
         "path": "<field-to-search>",
         "tokenOrder": "any|sequential",
         "fuzzy": <options>,
         "score": <options>
       }
     }
   }

.. _autocomplete-ref-options:

Options
-------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20 50 10 10

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
     - Necessity
     - Default

   * - ``query``
     - string or array of strings
     - String or strings to search for. If there are multiple
       terms in a string, |fts| also looks for a match for each term
       in the string separately.
     - yes
     -

   * - ``path``
     - string
     - Indexed field to search.
       This field must be indexed as the ``autocomplete`` data type. To learn more, 
       see :ref:`How to Index Fields for Autocompletion <bson-data-types-autocomplete>`. 
       
       The ``autocomplete`` operator doesn't support the ``multi`` or ``wildcard (*)`` 
       options in the ``path`` parameter. It also doesn't support an array of fields as the ``path`` value. 
       To learn more, see :ref:`Construct a Query Path <ref-path>`.
       
       For an example of an ``autocomplete`` operator query across multiple fields, 
       see :ref:`Search Across Multiple Fields <autocomplete-compound>` 
       or the Advanced Example in :ref:`How to Use Autocomplete with Atlas Search<autocomplete-tutorial>`. 

     - yes
     -

   * - ``fuzzy``
     - object
     - Enable fuzzy search. Find strings which are similar to the
       search term or terms.
     - no
     -

   * - | ``fuzzy``
       | ``.maxEdits``
     - integer
     - Maximum number of single-character edits required to match the
       specified search term. Value can be ``1`` or ``2``.
     - no
     - ``2``

   * - | ``fuzzy``
       | ``.prefixLength``
     - integer
     - Number of characters at the beginning of each term in the result
       that must exactly match.
     - no
     - ``0``

   * - | ``fuzzy``
       | ``.maxExpansions``
     - integer
     - Maximum number of variations to generate and search for. This
       limit applies on a per-token basis.
     - no
     - ``50``

   * - ``score``
     - object
     - :ref:`Score <scoring-ref>` to assign to the matching search term
       results. Use one of the following options to modify the default
       score:

       - ``boost``: Multiply the result score by the given number.
       - ``constant``: Replace the result score with the given number.
       - ``function``: Replace the result score with the given expression.
       
       ``autocomplete`` offers less fidelity in :ref:`score <scoring-ref>` 
       in exchange for faster query execution. To learn more, see :ref:`autocomplete-ref-scores`.
       
       For information on using ``score`` in your query, see :ref:`scoring-ref`.

     - no
     -

   * - ``tokenOrder``
     - string
     - Order in which to search for tokens. Value can be one of the
       following:

       .. list-table::
          :stub-columns: 1
          :widths: 30 70

          * - ``any``
            - Indicates tokens in the query can appear in any order in
              the documents. Results contain documents where the tokens
              appear sequentially and non-sequentially. However,
              results where the tokens appear sequentially score higher
              than other, non-sequential values.

          * - ``sequential``
            - Indicates tokens in the query must appear adjacent to
              each other or in the order specified in the query in the
              documents. Results contain only documents where the
              tokens appear sequentially.

     - no
     - ``any``

.. _autocomplete-ref-scores:

Scoring Behavior  
----------------

The ``autocomplete`` operator query results that are exact matches 
receive a lower score than results that aren't exact matches. |fts| 
can't determine if a query string is an exact match for an indexed text 
if you specify just the autocomplete-indexed token substrings. To score 
exact matches higher, try the following workaround: 

.. note::
   
   The following workaround doesn't guarantee higher scores for exact 
   matches in all cases.

1. Index the field as both :ref:`autocomplete
   <bson-data-types-autocomplete>` and :ref:`string
   <bson-data-types-string>` types. 

   |fts| ``autocomplete`` boosts exact matches when an ``autocomplete`` 
   field is also indexed as a ``string``, thereby increasing the score 
   of exact matches.

#. Query using the :ref:`compound-ref` operator.

For a demonstration of this workaround, see 
:ref:`autocomplete-compound`.

.. _autocomplete-ref-egs:

Examples
--------

The following examples use the ``movies`` collection in the 
``sample_mflix`` database. If you loaded the :ref:`sample dataset 
<available-sample-datasets>` on your {+cluster+}, you can create the 
static index for :ref:`autocompletion <bson-data-types-autocomplete>` 
and run the example queries on your cluster.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following query searches for movies with the characters ``pre`` in
the ``title`` field. The query uses:

.. list-table::
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``maxEdits``
     - Indicates that only one character variation is allowed in the
       query string ``pre`` to match the query to a word in the
       documents.

   * - ``prefixLength``
     - Indicates that the first character in the query string ``pre``
       can't change when matching the query to a word in the documents.

   * - ``maxExpansions``
     - Indicates that up to two hundred and fifty six similar terms for
       ``pre`` can be considered when matching the query string to a

which specifies whether the query searches for tokens in ``any`` order 
or in ``sequential`` order.

Highlighting Example 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following query searches for the characters ``ger`` in the 
``title`` field of the ``movies`` collection, with the 
``highlight`` option enabled for the ``title`` field.

   To highlight the autocomplete indexed version of a path, the 
   :ref:`autocomplete operator <autocomplete-ref>` must be the only 
   operator that uses that path in the query.

      |fts| returns documents that contain the term ``Gravity`` in the
      ``title`` field. The ``count`` field in the results indicate the number
      of documents in the collection with the same title. In the results,
      |fts| found three documents in the collection with ``Gravity`` as its
      title, but |fts| omitted the duplicate titles and returned only one
      matching document.
