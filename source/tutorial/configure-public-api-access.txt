To access the |mms| |api| using
:ref:`applications <mms-prog-api-key>`,
generate an |api| key or service account for your organization.
To learn more, see :ref:`cm-api-auth`.

.. note::

   You can't use |api| keys or service accounts to log into the |mms| Console.

(Optional) Require an API Access List for Your Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mms| allows your {+admin-api+} keys or service accounts to make requests from
any address on the internet unless you require an IP access list for
the {+admin-api+}. If you require an IP access list, your |api|
keys or service accounts can make |api| requests only from the location-based IP or |cidr|
addresses that you specify in the IP access list. 

Each |api| key or service account has its own IP access list. If you require an IP
access list for all {+admin-api+} requests, you must define at
least one IP access list entry for the |api| key or service account before you can use it.

When you create a new organization using the |mms| UI, |mms| enables
the |api| access list requirement by default. To disable the IP
access list requirement when you :ref:`create an organization
<create-organization>`, toggle 
:guilabel:`Require IP Access List for {+admin-api+}`
to :guilabel:`OFF` when you :ref:`create an organization
<create-organization>`.

To set your organization to require IP access lists for every 
{+admin-api+} key after organization creation, follow these steps:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-org-settings.rst

   .. step:: Toggle the :guilabel:`Require IP Access List for {+admin-api+}` setting to :guilabel:`On`.

Manage Access to the API
------------------------

You can set API Keys or service accounts for an entire organization or project.
To learn more, see :ref:`mms-prog-api-key`.
