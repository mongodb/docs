You can use the {+atlas-cli+} or the {+atlas-ui+} to manage
:manual:`indexes </core/indexes>` on your collections.

Indexes support the efficient execution of queries in MongoDB and should
be considered for fields which your application reads often. To learn
more about creating effective indexes, see :manual:`Indexing Strategies
</applications/indexes/>`.

Required Roles
--------------

To :ref:`create <atlas-ui-create-an-index>`,
:ref:`drop <atlas-ui-drop-an-index>`, or :ref:`hide <atlas-ui-hide-an-index>` indexes,
you must have access provided by at least one of the following roles:

- :authrole:`Project Owner` or :authrole:`Organization Owner`
- :authrole:`Project Data Access Admin`

Considerations
--------------

By default, you can have up to three concurrent index builds. To learn  
more, see :manual:`Maximum Concurrent Index Builds
</core/index-creation/#maximum-concurrent-index-builds>`.

.. _atlas-ui-view-indexes:

View Indexes
------------

From the :guilabel:`Collections` tab, you can view index information
for a collection. To view index information for a collection:

.. include:: /includes/steps/atlas-ui-indexes.rst

.. _atlas-ui-create-an-index:

Create an Index
---------------

.. tip::

   When you create indexes, keep the ratio of reads to writes on the
   target collection in mind. Indexes come with a performance cost, but
   are more than worth the cost for frequent queries on large data sets.
   Before you create an index, review the documented
   :manual:`indexing strategies </applications/indexes/>`.

.. note::

   You can build full-text search with :ref:`Atlas Search 
   <fts-top-ref>`. |fts| offers fine-grained text indexing. To learn 
   more, see :ref:`ref-index-definitions`.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-clusters-indexes-create.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      To create an index for a collection by using the {+atlas-ui+}:

      .. Attention writers: If you make changes to the following
      .. procedure please check the related procedures in the following
      .. Server docs page(s) to see if they require changes as well: 
      .. www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/expire-data/

      .. include:: /includes/steps/atlas-ui-create-index.rst

.. _atlas-ui-drop-an-index:

Drop an Index
-------------

To drop an index from a collection by using the {+atlas-ui+}:

.. include:: /includes/steps/atlas-ui-drop-index.rst

.. important::

   You can't delete or hide the ``_id`` index. To learn more, see
   :manual:`Unique Indexes </core/index-unique/>`.

   Consider :ref:`hiding the index <atlas-ui-hide-an-index>` 
   to evaluate the impact of dropping an index before you
   drop it. To learn more, see :manual:`Hidden Indexes </core/index-hidden/>`.

.. note:: {+atlas-cli+} Limitation

   You can't drop a {+cluster+}'s index by using the {+atlas-cli+}.

.. _atlas-ui-hide-an-index:

Hide an Index
-------------

To hide an index by using the {+atlas-ui+}:

.. include:: /includes/steps/atlas-ui-hide-index.rst
