Connect to Your Cloud {+Database-Deployment+}
---------------------------------------------

In order to connect to your {+database-deployment+}, you must get your 
deployment's :manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string>`.
Once you have the connection string, you can connect to your deployment
by using the following connection methods: 

- :ref:`connect-via-driver`
- :ref:`atlas-connect-via-compass`
- :ref:`connect-mongo-shell`
- :ref:`mongodb-for-vscode`

.. note::

   To connect using |mongodump| or |mongorestore|,
   use the :ref:`Command Line Tools <command-line-tools>` tab. The tab
   creates an auto-generated template for connecting to your |service|
   {+database-deployment+} with your preferred tool.

To get your deployment's connection string, you can
use the {+atlas-cli+} or {+atlas-ui+}:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      You can use the {+atlas-cli+} to get your deployment's standard connection string.

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-clusters-connectionStrings-describe.rst

      For example, if the {+atlas-cli+} returns the following connection string:

      .. code-block::

         mongodb+srv://mycluster.abcd1.mongodb.net

      You can connect to your deployment using {+mongosh+} by including the connection string
      in the {+mongosh+} command:

      .. code-block::

         mongosh "mongodb+srv://mycluster.abcd1.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase" --apiVersion 1 --username <username>

      .. note::

         To successfully connect to |service|, you must add your username and database name
         to the connection string. In some cases, such as when you're using {+mongosh+} 
         from the terminal, |service| prompts you to enter the password for the database user.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui
