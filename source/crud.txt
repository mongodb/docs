CRUD operations *create*, *read*, *update*, and *delete* documents.

Create Operations
-----------------

Create or insert operations add new documents to a collection. If the
collection does not exist, create operations also create the
collection.

You can insert a single document or multiple documents in a single
operation.

For examples, see :ref:`mongosh-insert`.

Read Operations
---------------

Read operations retrieve documents from a collection; i.e. query a
collection for documents.

You can specify criteria, or filters, that identify the documents to
return.

For examples, see :ref:`mongosh-read`.

Update Operations
-----------------

Update operations modify existing documents in a collection. You can
update a single document or multiple documents in a single operation.

You can specify criteria, or filters, that identify the documents to
update. These filters use the same syntax as read operations.

For examples, see :ref:`mongosh-update`.

Delete Operations
-----------------

Delete operations remove existing documents from a collection. You can
remove a single document or multiple documents in a single operation.

You can specify criteria, or filters, that identify the documents to
remove. These filters use the same syntax as read operations.

For examples, see :ref:`mongosh-delete`.
