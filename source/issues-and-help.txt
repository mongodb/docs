We are lucky to have a vibrant MongoDB Go community that includes users
with varying levels of experience using the Go driver. We find the quickest
way to get support for general questions is through the `MongoDB Community Forums <https://community.mongodb.com>`_.

To learn more, refer to our `support channels <http://www.mongodb.org/about/support>`_.

Bugs / Feature Requests
-----------------------

If you think you've found a bug or want to see a new feature in the Go
driver, please open a case in our issue management tool, JIRA:

* `Create an account and log in <https://jira.mongodb.org>`_.
* Navigate to `the GODRIVER project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/GODRIVER>`_.
* Click **Create Issue**. Please provide as much information as possible
  about the issue and the steps to reproduce it.

Bug reports in JIRA for the Go driver and the Core Server (i.e. SERVER) project are **public**.

If you've identified a security vulnerability in a driver or any other
MongoDB project, please report it according to the instructions found in the
:manual:`Create a Vulnerability Report page </tutorial/create-a-vulnerability-report>`.

Pull Requests
-------------

We are happy to accept contributions to help improve the driver. We will guide
user contributions to ensure they meet the standards of the codebase. Please
ensure that any pull requests include documentation, tests, and pass the
**gradle** checks.

To get started, check out the source and work on a branch:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver.git
   $ cd mongo-go-driver
   $ git checkout -b myNewFeature

Finally, follow the `Testing/Development guidelines
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver#testing--development>`__ to
ensure your code passes any newly added and existing tests.
