You can set or change your sync client's log level to develop or debug your 
application. You might want to change the log level to log different 
amounts of data depending on the app's environment.

Set the Sync Client Log Level
-----------------------------

You can set the level of detail reported by the sync client logger to 
specify the level of output you want from the sync client. Get 
:cpp-sdk:`an instance of an App's sync manager <structrealm_1_1internal_1_1bridge_1_1sync__manager.html>`, 
and pass a :cpp-sdk:`realm::logger::level <structrealm_1_1logger.html>`
to the ``set_log_level()`` member function:
