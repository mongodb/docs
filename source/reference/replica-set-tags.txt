|service| clusters are configured with pre-defined replica set tags
for different member types in the cluster. You can utilize these
pre-defined replica set tags to direct queries from specific
applications to specific node types, regions, and availability zones. 
These pre-defined replica set tags allow you to customize :manual:`read 
preferences </core/read-preference/>` for a replica set, thus improving 
cluster performance and reliability.

.. note::

   These pre-defined replica set tags differ from the 
   :ref:`resource tags <configure-resource-tags>` that you provide 
   and manage. You can't change these replica set tags that |service| 
   provides.

To use pre-defined replica set tags in your connection string and 
direct queries to specific nodes, use the following connection string 
options:

- ``readPreference``
- ``readPreferenceTags``
- ``readConcernLevel``

For examples, see :ref:`repl-set-tag-examples`.

Use Cases and Examples
----------------------

Consider the following scenarios where utilizing pre-defined replica set
tags would be beneficial, and see the corresponding sample connection
strings.

.. important:: High Availability for Analytics Node Queries
   
   For reads targeting analytic nodes with tags like ``readPreferenceTags=nodeType:ANALYTICS``,
   resilience is crucial when node availability fluctuates. Without fallback tags, 
   queries may fail during:

   * Initial sync during data compaction
   * Disk scale-down events
   * Any |nvme| cluster tier changes

   To mitigate these risks, ensure your connection string includes *multiple read 
   preference tags* to provide fallback options so |service| can route analytic 
   reads to available nodes during such events. For example:

   .. code-block:: none

      db+srv://<db_username>:<db_password>@foo-q8x1v.mycluster.com/test?readPreference=secondary&readPreferenceTags=nodeType:ANALYTICS,priority:1&readPreferenceTags=&readConcernLevel=local

   In this example:
   
   1. The application first tries to connect to a node tagged ``nodeType:ANALYTICS``.
   2. If no such nodes are available, the final empty ``readPreferenceTags=`` 
      allows the application to connect to any available secondary node.

.. note::

   Each of the following example connection strings employ the
   ``readConcernLevel=local`` connection string option. Specifying
   a :manual:`read concern of local </reference/read-concern-local/>`
   ensures that secondary reads on sharded clusters do not
   return :term:`orphaned documents <orphaned document>`. You do not
   need to specify this option when connecting to non-sharded replica sets.

Use Analytics Nodes to Isolate Workloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an application performs complex or long-running operations, such as
:abbr:`ETL (Extract Transform Load)` or reporting, you may want to
isolate the application's queries from the rest of your operational
workload by connecting exclusively to analytics nodes.

Consider the following connection string:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb+srv://<db_username>:<db_password>@foo-q8x1v.mycluster.com/test?readPreference=secondary&readPreferenceTags=nodeType:ANALYTICS&readConcernLevel=local

The connection string options appear in the following order:

- ``readPreference=secondary``
- ``readPreferenceTags=nodeType:ANALYTICS``
- ``readConcernLevel=local``

The :manual:`readPreference </reference/read-preference>` option of
``secondary`` and :manual:`readPreferenceTag
</core/read-preference/#tag-sets>` option of
``{ nodeType : ANALYTICS }`` limit the application connections to
analytic nodes.

Isolate Normal Application Secondary Reads from Analytics Nodes
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

You may want to isolate regular application reads from the workload on 
analytics nodes.

Consider the following connection string:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb+srv://<db_username>:<db_password>@foo-q8x1v.mycluster.com/test?readPreference=secondary&readPreferenceTags=workloadType:OPERATIONAL&readConcernLevel=local

The connection string options appear in the following order:

- ``readPreference=secondary``
- ``readPreferenceTags=workloadType:OPERATIONAL``
- ``readConcernLevel=local``

The specified options prevent your application from reading from
analytics nodes. The application must read from ``operational``, or
non-analytics, nodes.

Target Local Reads for Geographically-Distributed Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use pre-defined replica set tags to target local reads to
specific regions for globally distributed applications. Prior to the
introduction of these pre-defined replica set tags, local reads for 
globally distributed applications relied on correctly calculating the
:manual:`nearest </reference/read-preference/#nearest>` read
preference. With pre-defined replica set tags, specifying appropriate
geographic tags in combination with a read preference mode of 
``nearest`` provides more consistent behavior.

The following connection string prioritizes connections to the
|aws| ``US_EAST_1`` region, followed by the ``US_EAST_2`` region:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb+srv://<db_username>:<db_password>@foo-q8x1v.mycluster.com/test?readPreference=nearest&readPreferenceTags=provider:AWS,region:US_EAST_1&readPreferenceTags=provider:AWS,region:US_EAST_2&readPreferenceTags=&readConcernLevel=local

The connection string options appear in the following order:

- ``readPreference=nearest``
- ``readPreferenceTags=provider:AWS,region:US_EAST_1``
- ``readPreferenceTags=provider:AWS,region:US_EAST_2``
- ``readPreferenceTags=``
- ``readConcernLevel=local``

|service| considers each read preference tag in the order you specify
them. After |service| matches a node to a tag, it finds all eligible
nodes that match that tag. |service| then ignores any following
``readPreferenceTags``. 

In this example, the application first tries to connect to a node in
|aws| region ``US_EAST_1``. If there no nodes in that region are
available, the application tries to connect to a node in |aws| region
``US_EAST_2``.

The final (empty) ``readPreferenceTags=`` provides a fallback option.
With an empty ``readPreferenceTags=`` option, the application can
connect to any available node regardless of provider or region.

These options help ensure that the application connects to the closest
geographic region for reduced latency and improved performance.

.. note::

   You can further target reads based on availability zones.

.. seealso::

   For additional information and use cases for various read
   preferences, refer to the
   :manual:`Read Preference page in the MongoDB Manual
   </reference/read-preference/#use-cases>`.

.. _reduce-secondary-disk-warming-example:

Reduce Secondary Disk Warming Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When |service| adds or replaces a node in your cluster, it performs
:aws:`disk pre-warming </AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-initialize.html>`
by default. During the disk pre-warming process, the newly created storage
volume undergoes a period of heavy |iops| usage. This slows down read operations
made against this node. Therefore, during the disk pre-warming process,
|service| keeps the pre-warming node hidden by default, preventing it
from participating in any read operations.

If you prefer that a newly added or replaced node becomes immediately active
and visible, you can choose to :ref:`disable fast disk pre-warming <disk-pre-warming>`
and prevent read operations on a warming node by using a connection string
as in the following example:

.. code-block:: none
   
   mongodb+srv://<db_username>:<db_password>@foo-q8x1v.mycluster.com/test?readPreference=secondary&readPreferenceTags=diskState:READY&readConcernLevel=local

The connection string options appear in the following order:

- ``readPreference=secondary``
- ``readPreferenceTags=diskState:READY``
- ``readConcernLevel=local``

The :manual:`readPreference </reference/read-preference>` option of
``secondary`` and :manual:`readPreferenceTag
</core/read-preference/#tag-sets>` option of ``{ diskState : READY }``
tells |service| to only target warm nodes.

Retrieve Availability Zones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| provides pre-defined replica set tags for availability 
zones by default. These tags include the |aws| availability zone ID,
|gcp| fully-qualified name for a zone, or |azure| zone number. You can 
check the availability zone of a node by using the :method:`rs.conf()
<rs.conf>` shell method or by viewing the last ping of the cluster 
node.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: sh
    
      ...

      "tags": {
                "availabilityZone": "use2-az2",

      ...

.. _built-in-custom-wc:

Built-In Custom Write Concerns
------------------------------

|service| provides built-in custom write concerns for multi-region
clusters. Write concern describes the level of acknowledgment requested
from MongoDB for write operations to a cluster.

|service|'s built-in custom write concerns can help improve
data consistency by ensuring your operations are propagated to a set
number of regions to succeed.

To use a custom write concern, specify the
write concern in the :manual:`write concern document
</reference/write-concern/>` of your operation.

|service| provides the following custom write concerns for multi-region
clusters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 30 30 30

   * - Write Concern
     - Tags
     - Description
   * - ``twoRegions``
     - ``{ region: 2 }``
     - Write operations must be acknowledged by at least two regions in
       your cluster.
   * - ``threeRegions``
     - ``{ region: 3 }``
     - Write operations must be acknowledged by at least three regions
       in your cluster.
   * - ``twoProviders``
     - ``{ provider: 2 }``
     - Write operations must be acknowledged by at least two regions in 
       your cluster with distinct cloud providers.

.. example::

   Consider a multi-region cluster across three regions:
   **us-east-1**, **us-east-2**, and **us-west-1**. You want to have
   write operations propagate to all three regions in your cluster
   before |service| accepts them.

   The following operation inserts a document and requires that the
   operation be propagated to all three regions due to the
   ``{ w: "threeRegions" }`` write concern object:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.employees.insertOne(
        { name: "Bob Smith", company: "MongoDB" },
        { writeConcern: { w: "threeRegions" } }
      )
