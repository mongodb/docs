.. topic:: Multiple Monitoring Agents

   You can :ref:`activate Monitoring <activate-monitoring>`
   on multiple {+mdbagent+}s to distribute monitoring assignments and
   provide failover. |mms| distributes monitoring assignments among up
   to 100 running {+mdbagent+}s. Each {+mdbagent+} running active
   Monitoring monitors a different set of MongoDB processes. One
   {+mdbagent+} running active Monitoring per project is the primary
   Monitor. The primary Monitor reports the cluster's status to |mms|.
   As {+mdbagent+}s have Monitoring enabled or disabled, |mms|
   redistributes assignments. If the primary Monitor fails, |mms|
   assigns another {+mdbagent+} running active Monitoring to be the
   primary Monitor.

   If you run more than 100 {+mdbagent+}s with active Monitoring, the
   additional {+mdbagent+}s run as standby {+mdbagent+}s. A standby
   {+mdbagent+} is idle, except to log its status as a standby and
   periodically ask |mms| if it should begin monitoring.

   To tune the frequency at which standby {+mdbagent+}s check to see if
   they should begin monitoring and the interval |mms| uses to
   determine if a standby agent should start monitoring, see
   :ref:`standby-monitoring-agent`.

   If you install multiple Monitoring Agents, ensure that *all* the
   {+mdbagent+}s with active Monitoring can reach all the |mongod|
   processes in the deployment.

   To activate Monitoring on multiple {+mdbagent+}s, repeat the
   :ref:`activation process <activate-monitoring>` on multiple
   {+mdbagent+}s.
