title: Verify that MongoDB has started successfully
stepnum: 2
ref: verify
pre: |
  Verify that the :program:`mongod` process has started successfully by
  checking the contents of the log file at

  for a line reading
action:
  language: none
  code: |
    [initandlisten] waiting for connections on port 27017
post: |
  ``<port>`` is the port the :program:`mongod` listens on. If you
  modified the :setting:`net.port` setting in the ``/etc/mongod.conf``
  configuration file, the port may differ.

  If you modified the :setting:`systemLog.path` configuration
  file option, look for the log file at the location you specified
  to that setting.

  You may see non-critical warnings in the :program:`mongod`
  output. As long as you see the log line shown above, you can safely
  ignore these warnings during your initial evaluation of MongoDB.
