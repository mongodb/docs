Edit a Replica Set
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

For MMS managed MongoDB :term:`replica sets <replica set>` you can add
and remove hosts directly in the MMS console. MMS also allows you to
change the set's configuration by adjusting the member's properties.

Procedures
----------

Add a Replica Set Member
++++++++++++++++++++++++

You must have an existing server to which to deploy the new member. The
server can exist on your own system or on Amazon Web Services (AWS). You
can use MMS to provision new server on AWS, as described in
:doc:`/tutorial/add-server`.

To add a member to an existing replica set, increase the size of the
set, as follows:

.. include:: /includes/steps/add-replica-set-member.rst

Edit a Replica Set Member
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can edit the individual members of the replica set, designating the
:manual:`type of member </core/replica-set-members>` and priority level in
:manual:`elections </core/replica-set-elections>`.

.. include:: /includes/steps/edit-replica-set-member.rst
