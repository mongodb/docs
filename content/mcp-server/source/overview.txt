The MongoDB MCP Server allows you to easily interact 
with your MongoDB data and deployments from AI clients in 
natural language. 

You can use the MongoDB MCP Server with any 
MongoDB deployment, including MongoDB Atlas, MongoDB Community Edition, 
and MongoDB Enterprise Advanced.

What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?
-------------------------------------

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by
Anthropic to standardize how LLMs connect to and interact 
with external resources and services. MCP consists of a 
client-server architecture with the following key components:

- **MCP Host**: Application or environment where you want to use MCP, 
  such as a chat interface or IDE. For example, Claude Desktop or VS Code.
- **MCP Clients**: Components within the host that handle connections to MCP servers.
  For a list of clients that support MCP, see `MCP Clients <https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients>`__.
- **MCP Servers**: Programs that expose specific capabilities to the client. For example,
  the MongoDB MCP Server.
  
  The primary way that MCP servers expose capabilities to clients is
  through `tools <https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools>`__. 
  Tools are pre-defined, executable functions that enable LLMs to perform
  specific actions, such as interacting with external data
  sources like MongoDB.

To learn more, see `MCP documentation
<https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction>`_.

What is the MongoDB MCP Server?
-------------------------------

The MongoDB MCP Server is our official MCP server implementation
that gives your AI client a set of tools that can be used
to interact with your MongoDB data and deployments. These tools include
various administrative actions, such as managing cluster resources, 
as well as database operations like querying and indexing.

Use Cases
~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB MCP Server allows you to interact with your MongoDB data and
deployments using natural language, streamlining developer workflows and 
making it easier to perform complex tasks from AI interfaces. 
For example, the MongoDB MCP Server enables the following use cases:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 40 40
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Use case
     - Description
     - Prompt example

   * - Data exploration
     - Learn and explain your database schema and relationships.
     - ``Show the schema of the 'users' collection and explain the purpose of each field.``

   * - Database operations
     - Create, read, update, and delete data in your MongoDB collections.
     - ``Find all users from the past week and update their orders to 'shipped'.``

   * - Database Management
     - Perform administrative tasks to manage your clusters, database users, and more.
     - ``Create a new database user for my Atlas cluster with read-only access.``

   * - Code generation
     - Describe the data you need, then generate relevant MongoDB queries and application code.
     - ``Review the schema for the 'users' collection, then generate a Python script that deletes profiles older than 2 years.``

For a list of the specific tools available in the MongoDB MCP Server, 
see :ref:`mcp-server-tools`.
