Sort Results
============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Use ``sort`` to change the order in which read operations return
documents. ``Sort`` tells MongoDB to order returned documents by the
values of one or more fields in a certain direction. To sort returned
documents by a field in ascending (lowest first) order, use a value of
``1``. To sort in descending (greatest first) order instead, use ``-1``.
If you do not specify a sort, MongoDB does not guarantee the order of
query results.

Follow the instructions in the examples below to insert data into
a collection and perform a sort on the results of a query.
Consider a collection containing documents that describe books. To
insert this data into a collection, run the following operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   await collection.insertMany([
     { "_id": 1, "name": "The Brothers Karamazov", "author": "Dostoyevsky", "length": 824 },
     { "_id": 2, "name": "Les Misérables", "author": "Hugo", "length": 1462 },
     { "_id": 3, "name": "Atlas Shrugged", "author": "Rand", "length": 1088 },
     { "_id": 4, "name": "Infinite Jest", "author": "Wallace", "length": 1104 },
     { "_id": 5, "name": "Cryptonomicon", "author": "Stephenson", "length": 918 },
     { "_id": 6, "name": "A Dance with Dragons", "author": "Martin", "length": 1104 },
   ]);

Pass the following sort document to a read operation to ensure that the
operation returns books with longer lengths before books with shorter
lengths:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   // define an empty query document
   const query = {};
   // sort in descending (-1) order by length
   const sort = { length: -1 };
   const cursor = collection.find(query).sort(sort);
   await cursor.forEach(console.dir);

In this case, the number ``-1`` tells the read operation to sort the
books in descending order by length. ``find()`` returns the following
documents when this sort is used with an empty query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id": 2, "title": "Les Misérables", "author": "Hugo", "length": 1462 }
   { "_id": 4, "title": "Infinite Jest", "author": "Wallace", "length": 1104 }
   { "_id": 6, "title": "A Dance with Dragons", "author": "Martin", "length": 1104 }
   { "_id": 3, "title": "Atlas Shrugged", "author": "Rand", "length": 1088 }
   { "_id": 5, "title": "Cryptonomicon", "author": "Stephenson", "length": 918 }
   { "_id": 1, "title": "The Brothers Karamazov", "author": "Dostoyevsky", "length": 824 }

Sometimes, the order of two or more documents is ambiguous using a
specified sort. In the above case, both "A Dance with Dragons" and
"Infinite Jest" have ``1104`` pages, so the order in which they are
returned is not guaranteed. To resolve ties in your sorted results in a
repeatable way, add additional fields to the sort document:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   // define an empty query document
   const query = {};
   // sort in ascending (1) order by length
   const sort = { length: 1, author: 1 };
   const cursor = collection.find(query).sort(sort);
   await cursor.forEach(console.dir);

With the addition of the ``author`` field to the sort document, the read
operation sorts matching documents first by ``length`` and, in the event
of a tie, then by ``author``. Matched document fields are compared in
the same order as fields are specified in the sort document. ``find()``
returns the following ordering of documents when this sort is used on
the documents matching the query, sorting "Martin" before "Wallace" for
the two books with the same length:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id": 1, "title": "The Brothers Karamazov", "author": "Dostoyevsky", "length": 824 }
   { "_id": 5, "title": "Cryptonomicon", "author": "Stephenson", "length": 918 }
   { "_id": 3, "title": "Atlas Shrugged", "author": "Rand", "length": 1088 }
   { "_id": 6, "title": "A Dance with Dragons", "author": "Martin", "length": 1104 }
   { "_id": 4, "title": "Infinite Jest", "author": "Wallace", "length": 1104 }
   { "_id": 2, "title": "Les Misérables", "author": "Hugo", "length": 1462 }
