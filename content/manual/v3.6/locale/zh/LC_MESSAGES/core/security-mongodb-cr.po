"``MONGODB-CR`` is a challenge-response mechanism that authenticates users"
" through passwords. ``MONGODB-CR`` verifies supplied user credentials "
"against the user's :data:`name <admin.system.users.user>`, "
":data:`password <admin.system.users.credentials>` and "
":data:`authentication database <admin.system.users.db>`. The "
"authentication database is the database where the user was created, and "
"the user's database and the user's name together serve to identify the "
