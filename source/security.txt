Secure Your {+atlas+} Deployments
----------------------------------------

{+atlas+}, the fully managed service for MongoDB deployments 
in the cloud, comes preconfigured with secure default settings.
Atlas also provides the following key security features:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Security Feature
     - Description

   * - Authentication and Authorization 
     - In Atlas, you configure database users to access your
       deployments. Atlas provides various ways to perform 
       user authentication and authorization, 
       including LDAP, OIDC, and X.509. To learn more, see 
       :atlas:`Configure Authentication and Authorization
       </security/config-db-auth/>`.
  
   * - Encryption
     - By default, Atlas encrypts all data stored in your 
       deployments and uses TLS/SSL to encrypt the connections to your 
       databases. To add another layer of security, you can configure 
       :atlas:`Encryption at Rest using Customer Key Management
       </security-kms-encryption>`.

   * - IP Access List
     - Atlas allows connections only from addresses specified in 
       the IP access list. To learn how to manage client connections
       in Atlas, see :atlas:`Configure IP Access List Entries 
       </security/ip-access-list/>`.
   
   * - Cloud Provider Support
     - Atlas supports network peering connections and private endpoints
       to secure your deployments hosted on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
       To learn more, see :atlas:`Set Up a Network Peering Connection 
       </security-vpc-peering/>` and :atlas:`Configure Private Endpoints
       </security-configure-private-endpoints/>`.

For a full list of security features in Atlas, see 
:atlas:`Security Features for Clusters </setup-cluster-security/>`.
