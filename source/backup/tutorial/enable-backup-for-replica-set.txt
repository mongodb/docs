===================================
Activate |backup| for a Replica Set
===================================

.. start-content

Overview
--------

You can start, restart, and stop backups for replica sets. As appropriate, you
also can specify which instance to use for the initial sync, exclude
namespaces, authenticate, and change the snapshot schedule. If you use
two-factor authentication for login, you also will need to authenticate to
confirm your actions.

.. note::
   The replica set must be MongoDB version 2.0 or later.

Considerations
--------------

Excluded namespaces are databases or collections that will not be backed up.
This can be useful for namespaces containing log files or caches, for instance,
as well as reduce backup time and costs.

You can take snapshots every 6, 8, 12, or 24 hours and save for 2-5 days. Daily
snapshots can be stored up to 180 days. Weekly snapshots can be stored for 52
weeks. Monthly snapshots can be stored up to 36 months.

By default, snapshots are taken every 6 hours with hourly snapshots saved for 2
days. Daily snapshots are saved for one week, weekly snapshots for one month,
and monthly snapshots for a year.
   
Changes to the snapshot schedule will affect your snapshot storage costs. The
longer your snapshot window, the longer it will take to build a point in time
restore.

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/steps/backup-activate-replica-set.rst

Your Backup agent will start polling the specified instance for this replica
set.

See the :doc:`/backup/faq/` page for more details about backup configuration,
namespaces, authentication, and snapshots.
