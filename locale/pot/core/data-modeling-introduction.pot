msgid "Data in MongoDB has a *flexible schema*. Unlike SQL databases, where you must determine and declare a table's schema before inserting data, MongoDB's :term:`collections <collection>` do not enforce :term:`document` structure. This flexibility facilitates the mapping of documents to an entity or an object. Each document can match the data fields of the represented entity, even if the data has substantial variation. In practice, however, the documents in a collection share a similar structure."

msgid "The key challenge in data modeling is balancing the needs of the application, the performance characteristics of the database engine, and the data retrieval patterns. When designing data models, always consider the application usage of the data (i.e. queries, updates, and processing of the data) as well as the inherent structure of the data itself."

# 17ee2d256e4543bebfab78e3139a1fe0
msgid "In MongoDB, write operations are atomic at the :term:`document` level, and no single write operation can atomically affect more than one document or more than one collection. A denormalized data model with embedded data combines all related data for a represented entity in a single document. This facilitates atomic write operations since a single write operation can insert or update the data for an entity. Normalizing the data would split the data across multiple collections and would require multiple write operations that are not atomic collectively."
