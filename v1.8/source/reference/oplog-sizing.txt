The :ref:`mongosync <c2c-mongosync>` program uses :ref:`change streams
<changeStreams>` to synchronize data between source and destination
clusters. ``mongosync`` does not access the :term:`oplog` directly,
but when a change stream returns events from the past, the events must
be within the ``oplog`` time range.

Monitor oplog Size Needed for Initial Sync
------------------------------------------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Determine oplog Window

      To get the difference in seconds between the first and last entry
      in the ``oplog`` run :method:`db.getReplicationInfo()`. If you
      are replicating a sharded cluster, run the command on each shard.
      
      .. code-block:: javascript
       
         db.getReplicationInfo().timeDiff
         
      The value returned is the minimum ``oplog`` window of the
      cluster. If there are multiple shards, the smallest number is the
      minimum ``oplog`` window.

   .. step:: Determine mongosync Replication Lag

      To get the ``lagTimeSeconds`` value, run the  
      :ref:`/progress <c2c-api-progress>` command. 
      The lag time is the time in seconds between the 
      last event applied by ``mongosync`` and time of the current
      latest event on the source cluster.

      It is a measure of how far behind the source cluster ``mongosync`` is.

   .. step:: Validate oplog Size

      If the lag time approaches the minimum ``oplog`` window, make 
      one of the following changes:

      - Increase the ``oplog`` window. Use :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog`
        to set ``minRetentionHours`` greater than the current ``oplog`` 
        window.

        .. note:: 

           :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` is unsupported in Atlas. To resize 
           the oplog in Atlas, see :ref:`set-oplog-min-window`.    

      - Scale up the ``mongosync`` instance. Add CPU or memory to scale
        up the ``mongosync`` node so that it has a higher copy rate.

.. note::

   The :term:`oplog` window and rate of change for replication lag may vary 
   during synchronization. Repeat these steps during a migration to monitor the 
   progress.
