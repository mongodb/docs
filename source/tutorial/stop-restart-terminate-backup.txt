====================================
Stop, Restart, or Terminate a Backup
====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Stopping the |mms| Backup Service for a replica set or sharded cluster
suspends the service for that resource. |mms| stops taking new snapshots
but retains existing snapshots until their listed expiration date.

After stopping backups, you can restart the Backup Service at any
time. Depending how much time has elapsed, the Backup Service may
perform an :term:`initial sync`.

If you **terminate** a backup, |mms| immediately **deletes all the
backup's snapshots.**
