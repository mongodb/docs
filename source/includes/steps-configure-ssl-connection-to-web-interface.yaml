  a. Upload your ``.pem`` file to each |application| host. This
     certificate must be uploaded to each |onprem| host so they can
     accept |tls| connections.

  b. Change the owner of the ``.pem`` file to the user and group that
     own the |onprem| process.

  c. Change the permissions of the ``.pem`` file so only the file
     owner can read and write the file.

        :widths: 30 70

        * - Option
          - Action

        * - :setting:`URL to Access Ops Manager`
          - Provide the full |url| for |application| including port
            ``8443`` for |https| access.

            .. example::

               .. code-block:: ini
                  :copyable: false

                  https://opsmanager.example.com:8443

        * - :setting:`HTTPS PEM Key File`
          - Type the absolute file system path where the ``.pem``
            file is located on all |onprem| hosts in this box.

        * - :setting:`HTTPS PEM Key File Password`
          - If you encrypted the |https| |pem| Key File, type the
            password needed to decrypt it in this box.

        * - :setting:`Client Certificate Mode`

            present a |tls| certificate when connecting to a
            |tls|\-enabled |onprem|. |onprem| checks for certificates
            from these client hosts when they try to connect. If you
            choose to require the client |tls| certificates, make sure
            they are valid.

            Accepted values are:

            - :guilabel:`None`
