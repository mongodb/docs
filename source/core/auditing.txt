MongoDB Enterprise includes an auditing capability for
:binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances. The auditing
facility allows administrators and users to track system activity for
deployments with multiple users and applications.

Enable and Configure Audit Output
---------------------------------

The auditing facility can write audit events to the console, the :term:`syslog`, a JSON
file, or a BSON file. To enable auditing for MongoDB Enterprise, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-auditing`.

For information on the audit log messages, see :doc:`/reference/audit-message`.

Audit Events and Filter
-----------------------

Once enabled, the auditing system can record the following operations [#transactions]_:

- schema (DDL),
- replica set and sharded cluster,
- authentication and authorization, and
- CRUD operations (requires :parameter:`auditAuthorizationSuccess` set to ``true``).

For details on audited actions, see :ref:`audit-action-details-results`.

With the auditing system, you can :ref:`set up filters <audit-filter>` to restrict the
events captured. To set up filters, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-audit-filters`.

.. [#transactions]

   Operations in an aborted transaction still generate audit events.
   However, there is no audit event that indicates that the transaction
   aborted.

Audit Guarantee
---------------

The auditing system writes every audit event [#filter]_ to an
in-memory buffer of audit events. MongoDB writes this buffer to disk
periodically. For events collected from any single connection, the
events have a total order: if MongoDB writes one event to disk, the
system guarantees that it has written all prior events for that
connection to disk.

If an audit event entry corresponds to an operation that affects the
durable state of the database, such as a modification to data, MongoDB
will always write the audit event to disk *before* writing to the
:term:`journal` for that entry.

That is, before adding an operation to the journal, MongoDB writes all
audit events on the connection that triggered the operation, up to and
including the entry for the operation.

These auditing guarantees require that MongoDB run with
:setting:`journaling <storage.journal.enabled>` enabled.

.. warning::

   MongoDB may lose events **if** the server terminates before it
   commits the events to the audit log. The client may receive
   confirmation of the event before MongoDB commits to the audit log.
   For example, while auditing an aggregation operation, the server
   might terminate after returning the result but before the audit log
   flushes.

   In addition, if the server cannot write to the audit log at the
   :option:`audit destination <mongod --auditDestination>`, the server
   will terminate.

.. [#filter] Audit configuration can include a :ref:`filter
   <audit-filter>` to limit events to audit.
