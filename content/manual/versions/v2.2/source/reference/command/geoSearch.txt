.. dbcommand:: geoSearch

   The :dbcommand:`geoSearch` command provides an interface to
   MongoDB's :term:`haystack index` functionality. These indexes are
   useful for returning results based on location coordinates *after*
   collecting results based on some other query (i.e. a "haystack.")
   Consider the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { geoSearch : "places", near : [33, 33], maxDistance : 6, search : { type : "restaurant" }, limit : 30 }

   The above command returns all documents with a ``type`` of
   ``restaurant`` having a maximum distance of 6 units from the
   coordinates ``[30,33]`` in the collection ``places`` up to a
   maximum of 30 results.

   Unless specified otherwise, the :dbcommand:`geoSearch` command
   limits results to 50 documents.
