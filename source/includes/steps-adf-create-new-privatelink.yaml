  a. From the :guilabel:`AWS Region` list, select the region where you 
     want to create the private endpoint.

     You can select one of the following regions:

  a. Enter the following details about your |aws| |vpc|:

     .. tip:: 

        You can click :guilabel:`Show instruction` for the following
        settings to display a screenshot of the |aws| console where you
        can find the value for the setting. 

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 20 80

        * - :guilabel:`Your VPC ID`
          - Unique 22-character alphanumeric string that identifies 
            the peer |aws| |vpc|. Find this value on the |vpc| 
            dashboard in your |aws| account.

        * - :guilabel:`Your Subnet IDs`
          - Unique strings that identify the subnets that your |aws| 
            |vpc| uses. Find these values on the :guilabel:`Subnet` 
            dashboard in your |aws| account.

            .. important::

               You must specify at least one subnet. If you don't, 
               |aws| won't provision an :term:`interface endpoint` in
               your |vpc|. An interface endpoint is required for 
               clients in your |vpc| to send traffic to the private 
               endpoint.

  #. Copy the command the dialog displays and run it using the |aws| 
     CLI.

     .. note::
        
        You can't copy the command until |service| finishes creating 
        |vpc| resources in the background.

     See :aws:`Creating an Interface Endpoint </vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#create-interface-endpoint>` 
     to perform this task using the |aws| CLI.

  #. Enter the 22-character alphanumeric string that identifies your 
     private endpoint in the :guilabel:`VPC Endpoint ID` field. Find 
     this value on the |aws| VPC Dashboard under 
     :guilabel:`Endpoints` > :guilabel:`VPC ID`.

  #. Enter the alpha-numeric DNS hostname associated with your private
     endpoint on |aws| in the :guilabel:`Your VPC Endpoint DNS Name`
     field. 

     If you have multiple DNS names for your private endpoint, copy and
     paste the first name from your list. To learn more, see
     :aws:`Manage DNS names for VPC endpoint services
     </vpc/latest/privatelink/manage-dns-names.html>`.

  This security group must allow inbound traffic on all ports from each 
  resource that needs to connect to your {+fdi+} using {+aws-pl+}:

  a. In the |aws| console, navigate to the :guilabel:`VPC Dashboard`. 
  
  #. Click :guilabel:`Security Groups`, then click 
     :guilabel:`Create security group`.

  #. Use the wizard to create a security group. Make sure you select 
     your VPC from the :guilabel:`VPC` list.

  #. Select the security group you just created, then click the 
     :guilabel:`Inbound Rules` tab.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Edit Rules`.

  #. Add rules to allow all inbound traffic from each resource in your
     VPC that you want to connect to your {+fdi+}.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Save Rules`.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Endpoints`, then click the endpoint for your
     VPC.

  #. Click the :guilabel:`Security Groups` tab, then click 
     :guilabel:`Edit Security Groups`.

  #. Add the security group you just created, then click 
     :guilabel:`Save`.
