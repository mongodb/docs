A database profiler gathers statistics about writes, cursors, and
commands on one running mongod instance.

|service| can collect and display statistics from any of your mongod
instances. |service| displays this data in the :guilabel:`Profiler`
section of an instance's :doc:`Metrics </monitor-cluster-metrics>`
page. To access an instance's metrics, click the :guilabel:`Metrics` button for that instance.

The :guilabel:`Profiler` displays one aspect, like *Operation Execution
Time*, that could slow database operations over a set time frame. It
displays this data in both a chart and a table that each can filter on
aspect and time frame.

Considerations
--------------

.. important:: Please read the following considerations before you enable profiling.

Security
~~~~~~~~

Profile data may include sensitive information including the content of
database queries. Ensure that exposing this data to |service| is
consistent with your information security practices.

Data Display Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| displays no more than 10,000 data points in the
:guilabel:`Profiler` charts.

Log data is processed in batches. Data can be delayed up to five minutes from realtime.

Enable and Disable Profiling
----------------------------

|service| enables Profiling by default.

To disable profiling:

1. Click :guilabel:`Project Settings` in the left navigation.
#. Toggle :guilabel:`Performance Advisor and Profiler` to
   :guilabel:`Off`.

Your mongod instance collects profile data for operations longer than
the slow operation threshold and report them to |service|. The
threshold for slow operations applies to the entire mongod instance.
|service| sets this threshold to 100 ms. You can't change this
threshold.
