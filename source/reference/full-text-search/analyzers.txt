|fts| makes text fields searchable by creating full text indexes in
MongoDB Atlas. You can control the index characteristics, such as where
to break up word groupings and whether to consider punctuation, by
specifying an analyzer to use when creating the index.

.. TODO "MongoDB looks at the specified field..." Better wording?

In order to create a |fts| index on a field, MongoDB looks at the
specified field and breaks it down into a list of searchable words.
This process is called analysis, and you can control the analysis
parameters by specifying an analyzer. |fts| has many built-in
analyzers which you can specify at the time of index creation
and/or at the time of query execution.

You can specify an analyzer to use during index creation in your
``config.json`` file. If you don't specify an analyzer, MongoDB uses
the default ``standard`` analyzer.

Built-in analyzers are available to create indexes tailored to several
languages and search configurations. If none of the built-in analyzers
suits your requirements, you can override an existing analyzer with a
custom set of parameters.
