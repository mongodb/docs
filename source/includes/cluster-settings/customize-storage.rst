Each cluster comes with a default set of resources. Clusters tier. M10 and larger 
provide the ability to customize your storage capacity.

|service| provides the following storage configuration options,
depending on the selected cloud provider and cluster tier.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 20 60
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Cluster Class
     - AWS only
     - Cluster tiers M40 and larger on AWS offer multiple options,
       including:

       - :guilabel:`Low CPU`
       - :guilabel:`General`
       - :guilabel:`Local NVMe SSD`

         Locally attached ephemeral :ref:`NVMe SSDs <nvme-storage>`
         offer the best performance.

       Select the :guilabel:`Class` box with your preferred speed.
       Changes to cluster class affect
       :ref:`cost <instance-size-costs>`.

   * - Storage Capacity
     - 
     - The size of the server data volume. To change this, either:

       - Specify the exact disk size in the text box, *or*

       - Move the slide bar until the text box displays your preferred
         disk size.

       Changes to storage capacity affect
       :ref:`cost <instance-size-costs>`.

   * - Auto-Expand Storage
     - 
     - Available on cluster tier M10 and larger. When disk usage
       reaches 90%, automatically increase storage to achieve 70%
       utilization. To enable this feature, check the box marked
       :guilabel:`Auto-expand storage when disk usage reaches 90%`.

       Changes to storage capacity affect
       :ref:`cost <instance-size-costs>`.

       Contact |service| support for guidance on oplog sizing for
       clusters with automatic storage expansion enabled. For details
       on how |service| handles reaching database storage limits, refer
       to the :ref:`FAQ page <faq-storage limit>`.

       .. note::

          AWS clusters with local :ref:`NVMe SSDs <nvme-storage>`
          cannot expand incrementally. When disk usage reaches 90%,
          NVMe clusters scale to the next available cluster tier, if
          any.

   * - |iops|
     - AWS only
     - |service| clusters on AWS of size M30 and greater allow you to
       customize the maximum |iops| rate of your cluster. To provision
       the |iops| rate of your cluster, check the box marked
       :guilabel:`Provision IOPS` and either:

       - Specify the exact |iops| rate in the text box, *or*

       - Move the slide bar until the text box displays your preferred
         |iops| rate.

       .. note::

          The available |iops| range for a cluster is tied to disk
          :ref:`storage capacity <storage-capacity-ui>`. If you modify
          your cluster's storage capacity, the range of available
          |iops| values changes as well.

          If you do not choose to provision |iops|, the default |iops|
          rate changes as the cluster's storage capacity changes.

          Changes to |iops| provisioning affect
          :ref:`cost <instance-storage-speed>`.

.. important::

   For cluster tiers up to and including M40, |service| enforces a
   50:1 ratio of disk storage to RAM to facilitate consistent
   performance of clusters with large datasets. For cluster tier
   M50 and higher, the enforced ratio is 100:1. 

   .. example::

      To support 3 TB of disk storage you must select a cluster 
      with at least 32 GB of RAM (M50 or higher).

   |service| has a 4 TB disk storage limit on all replica sets and
   shards, regardless of cluster. To expand total cluster
   storage beyond 4 TB, enable :ref:`sharding
   <cluster-option-sharding>`.

   For clusters with :guilabel:`Auto-Expand Storage` enabled,
   |service| respects the calculated maximum storage for the
   selected cluster. Users whose disk storage reaches the
   allowable limit receive notification by email.
