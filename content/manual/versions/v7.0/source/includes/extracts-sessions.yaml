ref: sessions-options

   Starting in 3.6, MongoDB drivers associate all operations with a server
   session, with the exception of unacknowledged writes. The following
   options are available for all commands to support association with a
   server session:

   .. important::
      
      :binary:`~bin.mongosh` and the drivers assign these options
      to the commands in the session.

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 15 15 50

      * - Option
        - Type
        - Description

      * - ``lsid``
        - Document

        - The document that specifies the unique ID of the session
          associated with the command. If the ``txnNumber`` is
          specified, the ``lsid`` is required.

      * - ``txnNumber``

        - 64-bit integer

        - A strictly increasing non-negative number that uniquely
          identifies the command in the command's session.

          If specified, the command must also include the ``lsid``
          option.

   For the :dbcommand:`delete`, :dbcommand:`insert`, and :dbcommand:`update`
   commands that take an array of statements, the following option is also
   available:

   .. important::

      Do not manually set ``stmtIds``. MongoDB sets the ``stmtIds``
      to be strictly increasing non-negative numbers.

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 15 15 50

      * - Option
        - Type
        - Description

      * - ``stmtIds``

        - Array of 32-bit integers

        - Array of numbers that uniquely identify their respective
          write operations within the write command.

   The following commands can be used to list, manage, and kill server
   sessions throughout MongoDB clusters:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 15 50

      * - Commands
        - Descriptions

      * - :dbcommand:`endSessions`

        - Expires specified server sessions.

      * - :dbcommand:`killAllSessions`

        - Kills all server sessions.

      * - :dbcommand:`killAllSessionsByPattern`

        - Kills all server sessions that match the specified pattern.

      * - :dbcommand:`killSessions`

        - Kills specified server sessions.

      * - :dbcommand:`refreshSessions`

        - Refreshes idle server sessions.

      * - :dbcommand:`startSession`

        - Starts a new server session.

ref: sessions-external-username-limit
content: |

   To use :ref:`sessions` with ``$external`` authentication users
   (Kerberos, LDAP, or X.509 users), usernames cannot be greater
   than 10k bytes.

ref: sessions-cursor-timeout
content: |

   MongoDB drivers and :binary:`~bin.mongosh`
   associate all operations with a :doc:`server session
   </reference/server-sessions>`, with the exception of unacknowledged
   write operations. For operations not explicitly associated with a
   session (i.e. using :method:`Mongo.startSession()`), MongoDB drivers
   and ``mongosh`` create an implicit session and associate it
   with the operation.
   
   If a session is idle for longer than 30 minutes, the MongoDB server
   marks that session as expired and may close it at any time. When the
   MongoDB server closes the session, it also kills any in-progress
   operations and open cursors associated with the session. This
   includes cursors configured with :method:`~cursor.noCursorTimeout` or
   a :method:`~cursor.maxTimeMS` greater than 30 minutes.
