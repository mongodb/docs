   If you want to combine two or more data sources, you must create an {+adf+}.

.. _add-data-source:
.. _connect-data-source:

Connect a Data Source to |charts-short|
---------------------------------------

Connect to a specific data source to |charts-short| to use its data 
in your charts.

When you connect a data source, |charts-short| grants the default
:ref:`permissions <permission-model>` to |charts-short| users. To
customize the permissions for a data source, see
:ref:`mod-data-source-permissions`.

|charts-short| connects to all deployments and data sources by default.
To learn about data sources and deployments, see :ref:`data-sources`.
To learn how to connect or disconnect a deployment, see :ref:`manage-deployment`.

To connect a data source to |charts-short|:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Connect your deployment. 

      To learn more, see :ref:`connect-deployment`.

   .. step:: In the :guilabel:`Data Access` section, select the database that contains the data source.

      Select the database that contains the data source you want to
      connect. The database's data sources display, including 
      :ref:`charts views <charts-views>`.

      If the database is disconnected:
      
      a. Click the :guilabel:`Connect` button next to the database.
      b. In the :guilabel:`Reconnect Database` dialog box, click :guilabel:`Reconnect`.

      |charts-short| displays the following information about the data source:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 38 72

         * - Column
           - Description

         * - :guilabel:`Data Source`
           - Human-readable label that identifies the data source and
             its chart views.

         * - :guilabel:`Organization`
           - Label that indicates whether you've enabled 
             :ref:`organization-wide sharing <org-sharing-data-source>`.

         * - :guilabel:`External Users`
           - Label that indicates whether: 
           
             - You enabled external user access.
             - The external user connection method is
               :guilabel:`Authenticated` or :guilabel:`Unauthenticated`.

         * - :guilabel:`Status`
           - Label that indicates whether you connected the 
             data source to |charts|.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Manage` next to the data source's information.

      The data source's details page displays the following
      information:

      .. list-table::

         :widths: 38 72

         * - Field
           - Description

         * - :guilabel:`Data Source Name`
           - Human-readable label that identifies the data source in 
             |service|.
     
         * - :guilabel:`Data Source Connection Status`
           - Label that indicates whether you connected the 
             data source to |charts|.

      To learn more about the other information that displays on the
      data source's details page, see
      :ref:`manage-existing-data-sources`.

   .. step:: Check the connection status and connect the data source.

      If the data source connection status is :guilabel:`Connected`,
      you already connected this data source to |charts|. The
      :guilabel:`Data Access` section displays.
      
      If the data source connection status is :guilabel:`Disconnected`: 
        
      a. Click the connect icon :icon-fa5:`link` next to the data
         source connection status.
      #. Click :guilabel:`Reconnect` on the modal that displays. 
        
      The data source connects and the :guilabel:`Data Access`
      section displays.

      To learn more about the other information that displays in the
      data source's :guilabel:`Data Access` section, see
      :ref:`manage-existing-data-sources`.

.. _disconnect-data-source:

Disconnect a Data Source or Database from |charts|
--------------------------------------------------

Disconnect a data source or database from |charts-short| to remove its data from
your charts. If you disconnect a data source:

- Any charts you built that use the data source no longer
  render and display an error.
- Any charts that use :pipeline:`$lookup` to access data in the data
  source no longer render and display an error.
- You can't use the data source to build new charts.

If you disconnect a database, |charts-short| disconnects 
all of the data sources in the database. You can :ref:`reconnect
<connect-data-source>` a data source or database later to 
resume rendering charts that use its data.

You can also :ref:`disconnect a deployment <disconnect-deployment>`.
To delete a charts view, see :ref:`charts-views`.

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/sample-data-source-description.rst

To disconnect a data source or database from |charts-short|:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Disconnect Data Source
      :tabid: disconnect-data-source

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. include:: /includes/steps-access-deployment.rst

         .. step:: In the :guilabel:`Data Access` section, select the database that contains the data source.

            Select the database that contains the data source you want to
            disconnect. The database's data sources display.

         .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Manage` next to the data source's information.

            The data source's details page displays.

         .. step:: Check the connection status and disconnect the data source.

            If the data source connection status is :guilabel:`Disconnected`,
            the data source is already disconnected from |charts|.
            
            If the data source connection status is :guilabel:`Connected`:
         
            a. Click the disconnect icon :icon-fa5:`unlink` next to the data
               source connection
               status. The :guilabel:`Disconnect Data Source` modal appears.
            #. Click :guilabel:`Check for connected charts` to
               learn whether any charts use the
               data source.
            #. Click :guilabel:`Disconnect`.
         
            The data source disconnects from |charts-short|.

   .. tab:: Disconnect Database
      :tabid: disconnect-database

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

               in the database.
            #. Click :guilabel:`Disconnect` to confirm your selection.

.. _access-data-source-settings-page:

Access Data Source Settings
---------------------------

To access the data source's settings page:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/steps-access-deployment.rst

   .. step:: In the :guilabel:`Data Access` section, under :guilabel:`Deployment`, click the name of the database that contains the data source.

      The data source's details page displays.

   .. step:: Check the connection status and connect the data source.

      If the data source connection status is :guilabel:`Connected`,
      you already connected this data source to |charts|. The
      :guilabel:`Data Access` section displays.

      If the data source connection status is :guilabel:`Disconnected`: 

      a. Click the connect icon :icon-fa5:`link` next to the data
         source connection status.
      #. Click :guilabel:`Reconnect` on the modal that displays. 

      The data source connects and the :guilabel:`Data Access`
      section displays.

.. _data-source-embedding:
.. _mod-data-source-permissions:

Modify Data Source Permissions
------------------------------

If you have the :authrole:`Project Owner` role, you can control who can see charts that use the data source.

.. _org-sharing-data-source:

Enable Organization-Wide Sharing for a Data Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-org-wide-sharing.rst

To enable organization-wide sharing for a specific data source:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Access the data source's settings page.

      To learn more, see :ref:`access-data-source-settings-page`.

   .. step:: Turn on organization-wide sharing.
    
      In the :guilabel:`Organization` subsection of the 
      :guilabel:`Data Access` section, toggle 
      :guilabel:`All users in the organization can view data in this data source` to :guilabel:`ON`.

Enable External Sharing for a Data Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

External sharing grants others the ability to either:

- :ref:`Embed charts <embedding-charts>` to use the data source in
  external web pages.
- View charts when given a link to that chart.

To share a chart externally via embed or link, you must enable external
sharing both on the data source and the individual chart.

|charts-short| disables external sharing by default for all data
sources. 

To enable external sharing for a data source:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Access the data source's settings page.

      To learn more, see :ref:`access-data-source-settings-page`.

   .. step:: Turn on external sharing.

      In the :guilabel:`External Users` subsection of the :guilabel:`Data Access` section, toggle 
      :guilabel:`External users can view data in this data source` to
      :guilabel:`ON`.

   .. step:: Select your authentication settings.
   
      Select either:

      a. :guilabel:`Allow authenticated external data access`.

         Any chart that uses this data source requires authentication through an
         :abbr:`SSO (Single Sign-On)` provider for external viewing. Authentication
         providers add an extra layer of security to your data.

         To learn how to configure an embedding authentication provider,
         see :doc:`/configure-auth-providers`.

         Users can view charts that use this data source on dashboards when they are logged into |charts|. They can't view the charts on dashboards shared via a public link.

      #. :guilabel:`Allow unauthenticated external data access`.

         Any chart that uses this data source does **not** require authentication for external viewing. Though less
         difficult to implement, allowing unauthenticated external data access is less secure. Use this option only for charts
         that display non-sensitive data.

         - Embedded charts can render using both unauthenticated and
           authenticated requests.

         - Any charts using this data source can be viewed on
           :ref:`dashboards shared via a link <dashboard-access-link>`.

After you enable external sharing for a data source, you can enable external sharing for individual charts that use that data source.

.. note::

   If you turn off external sharing for a data source, all charts which 
   use that data source stop rendering immediately.

Disable External Sharing for a Data Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To disable external sharing for a data source:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Access the data source's settings page.

      To learn more, see :ref:`access-data-source-settings-page`.

   .. step:: Turn off external sharing.

      In the :guilabel:`External Users` subsection of the :guilabel:`Data Access` section, toggle 
      :guilabel:`External users can view data in this data source` to
      :guilabel:`OFF`.

.. _permission-model:
.. _data-source-set-permissions:
.. _data-source-specific-access:
.. _data-source-access-everyone:

Modify Role Permissions for Data Sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have the :authrole:`Project Owner` role, you can modify data source permissions for :guilabel:`Non-Data` roles. Data source permissions determine whether 
a user can view charts created using data in this data source.

.. note::

   |charts-short| automatically assigns project roles to users based on
   their |service| :atlas:`user role </reference/user-roles>`.

To modify permissions for :guilabel:`Non-Data` project roles:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Access the data source's settings page.

      To learn more, see :ref:`access-data-source-settings-page`.

   .. step:: Change the data source permissions for Non-Data roles.

      You can select or clear the :guilabel:`Can view charts with data in this data source` option to allow :guilabel:`Non-Data` roles to view charts for the data source:

      Hover over a project role to learn which :atlas:`Atlas user roles </reference/user-roles>` correspond to that project role.

      |charts-short| already authorizes data source permissions to view and create charts for :authrole:`Project Owner`, and :guilabel:`Data` roles. 


.. _modify-data-source-read-preference:

Modify Data Source Read Preference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To modify a data source's read preference, you must modify the read preference for its deployment. To learn more, see
:ref:`manage-deployment`.

Modify Data Source Pipeline
---------------------------

You can modify a chart view's pipeline by 
:ref:`accessing the data source's settings page
<access-data-source-settings-page>` and clicking the
:guilabel:`Pipeline` tab. To learn more, see
:ref:`data-sources-pipeline`.

The :guilabel:`Pipeline` is dimmed for collections. To create a
pipeline based on a collection, :ref:`create a charts view
<charts-views>`.
