How many collections can a single |service| cluster have?
---------------------------------------------------------

While there is no hard limit on the number of collections in a single 
cluster, the performance of a cluster may degrade if it serves larger 
numbers of collections and indexes. Larger collections have a greater 
impact on performance.

The recommended maximum number of collections and indexes by |service| 
cluster are as follows:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Cluster tier
     - Recommended maximum

   * - :guilabel:`M10`
     - 5,000 collections and indexes

   * - :guilabel:`M20 / M30`
     - 10,000 collections and indexes

   * - :guilabel:`M40+`
     - 100,000 collections and indexes

Which versions of MongoDB do |service| clusters use?

When does MongoDB upgrade the database version of free and shared tier clusters?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

|service| upgrades free and shared tier clusters to the newest MongoDB
version after several patch versions become available for that version.
To learn more about how MongoDB versions its software, see
:manual:`MongoDB Versioning </reference/versioning>`.

What happens to |service| clusters using a MongoDB version nearing end of life?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. admonition:: Unsupported MongoDB Versions in |service|
   :class: note

   |service| no longer supports MongoDB {+latest-mongodb-eol+} and
   earlier.

MongoDB sends you an email notification at least six months before the
MongoDB version reaches end of life. A few months after you receive
this notification, |service|:

- Stops allowing you to deploy new clusters using the end of life
  version.

- Notifies you of the version cut-off date. After the cut-off date,
  |service| upgrades your clusters to the next MongoDB version unless
  you request and receive approval for an extension.

.. example::
   When MongoDB 3.4 reaches end of life, |service|
   upgrades each of your clusters running MongoDB 3.4 to
   MongoDB 3.6.

This upgrade happens within your maintenance window if you
:ref:`configured one in your project settings <atlas-modify-project-settings>`.

In most cases, this upgrade won't cause downtime or negatively affect
your applications. You should :doc:`upgrade your cluster </tutorial/major-version-change>` before the cut-off date to ensure that your
services and applications experience no downtime or other issues due to
incompatibilities with the new MongoDB version.

To learn about potential issues for the cluster when
upgrading MongoDB versions, see ``Compatibility Changes`` in the
:manual:`MongoDB Release Notes </release-notes>` for the next MongoDB
version.

.. seealso:: To review the end of life date for each MongoDB Server
   release, see ``MongoDB Server`` in the
   :website:`MongoDB Support Policy </support-policy>`.
