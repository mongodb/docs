Install MMS On-Prem for Testing
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MMS On-Prem is a service to monitor and backup MongoDB clusters. The
service uses the components described in :doc:`/core/system-overview`. In
a test deployment, the components can run on a single server, as shown in
the :ref:`on-prem-minimal-deployment-diagram` diagram.

The minimal deployment is for testing only. Running on a single server is
**not** suitable for production deployments.
