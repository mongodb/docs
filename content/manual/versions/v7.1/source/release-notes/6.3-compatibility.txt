This page describes changes introduced in MongoDB 6.3 that can affect
compatibility with older versions of MongoDB.

Time Series Collections
-----------------------

The following changes to :ref:`time series collections <manual-timeseries-landing>`
can affect compatibility with older versions of MongoDB.

Granularity Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.3, you can configure time series bucket 
granularity using the new ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds`` and
``bucketRoundingSeconds`` custom bucketing parameters. To downgrade
below 6.3, you must either drop all collections with these parameters,
or modify them to use the corresponding ``granularity``. For details,
see :dbcommand:`collMod`.

Not all ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds`` and ``bucketRoundingSeconds`` values
correspond to a ``granularity`` value. In such cases, you must drop the
collection. 

Partial TTL Indexes for Time Series Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.3, you can create partial :ref:`Time To
Live (TTL) <index-feature-ttl>` indexes on time series collections. To 
downgrade below 6.3, you must remove all partial TTL indexes from your
time series collections.
