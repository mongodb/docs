msgid "Data in MongoDB has a *flexible schema*. Unlike SQL databases, where you must determine and declare a table's schema before inserting data, MongoDB's :term:`collections <collection>` do not enforce :term:`document` structure. This flexibility facilitates the mapping of documents to an entity or an object. Each document can match the data fields of the represented entity, even if the data has substantial variation. In practice, however, the documents in a collection share a similar structure."

msgid "The key challenge in data modeling is balancing the needs of the application, the performance characteristics of database engine, and the data retrieval patterns. When designing data models, always consider the application usage of the data (i.e. queries, updates, and processing of the data) as well as the inherent structure of the data itself."

msgid "The key decision in designing data models for MongoDB applications revolves around the structure of documents and how the application represents relationships between data. There are two tools that allow applications to represent these relationships: *references* and *embedded documents*."

msgid "Embedded documents capture relationships between data by storing related data in a single document structure. MongoDB documents make it possible to embed document structures as sub-documents in a field or array within a document. These *denormalized* data models allow applications to retrieve and manipulate related data in a single database operation."

# 2b5f7fa06c134d58a21f05d851353ee4
msgid "In MongoDB, write operations are atomic at the :term:`document` level, and no single write operation can atomically affect more than one document or more than one collection. A denormalized data model with embedded data combines all related data for a represented entity in a single document. This facilitates atomic write operations since a single write operation can insert or update the data for an entity. Normalizing the data would split the data across multiple collections and would require multiple write operations that are not atomic collectively."

msgid "Some updates, such as pushing elements to an array or adding new fields, increase a :term:`document's <document>` size. If the document size exceeds the allocated space for that document, MongoDB relocates the document on disk. The growth consideration can affect the decision to normalize or denormalize data.
