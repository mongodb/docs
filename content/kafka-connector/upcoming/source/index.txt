Overview
--------

The `{+connector-long+} <https://www.mongodb.com/kafka-connector>`__ is
a Confluent-verified connector that persists data from {+kafka+} topics as a
data sink into MongoDB and publishes changes from MongoDB into Kafka
topics as a data source.

We recommend that you use one of the following MongoDB partner service
offerings to host your {+kafka+} cluster and {+connector+}:

- `Confluent Cloud <https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/?utm_campaign=tm.pmm_cd.2023_partner_cwc_mongodb_generic&utm_source=mongodb&utm_medium=partnerref/>`__

  - Register to learn more about the `MongoDB Source Connector <https://confluent.cloud/go/new-source-connector/MongoDbAtlasSource?utm_campaign=tm.partner_cd.cwc-mongodb&utm_medium=partnerref>`__,
    or read the `documentation <https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-mongo-db-source.html>`__.
  - Register to learn more about the `MongoDB Sink Connector <https://confluent.cloud/go/new-sink-connector/MongoDbAtlasSink?utm_campaign=tm.partner_cd.cwc-mongodb&utm_medium=partnerref>`__,
    or read the `documentation <https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-mongo-db-sink.html>`__.

- `Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) <https://aws.amazon.com/msk/>`__
- `Redpanda Cloud <https://redpanda.com/redpanda-cloud>`__

  - To learn more about the MongoDB Source Connector, read the `documentation <https://docs.redpanda.com/current/deploy/deployment-option/cloud/managed-connectors/create-mongodb-source-connector/>`__.
  - To learn more about the MongoDB Sink Connector, read the `documentation <https://docs.redpanda.com/current/deploy/deployment-option/cloud/managed-connectors/create-mongodb-sink-connector/>`__.
