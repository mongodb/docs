Overview
--------
 
|service| users manage |service| groups. Creating a new user in a group
grants that user access to that group. Users can belong to any number 
of |service| groups.

.. _atlas_roles:

Roles
-----

When you create a user, you assign the user a role in the group. A role 
determines the actions the user can perform and the data the user can 
access. 

The roles available in |service| are :guilabel:`Owner` and 
:guilabel:`Read Only`. The following :ref:`Add Users <atlas_add_users>` 
section provides details on the roles available and their access levels.

.. important::

   |service| users are separate from MongoDB users. MongoDB users can
   access MongoDB databases, while |service| users can access the
   |service| application itself.

View Users
----------

To view users, click :guilabel:`Users`. The page lists users who belong 
to this |service| group. |service| provides the following information 
for each user:
  - Username
  - Role 
  - Date created 
  - Last login
  - Timezone
  - Available actions (Edit and Delete)

On the Users page, users are ordered by status. They appear in the 
following sequence:
  1. Users currently in your group.
  #. Users with pending invitations to join your group.
  #. Users requesting to join your group.

A user can request to join a group when first registering for |service|.

View Invitations
----------------

When you invite a user to join a group, if the user exists in |service|
they are added to the group automatically. If the user does not exist in
|service|, |service| sends an email to the prospective user inviting
them to join your group. 

To view any unaccepted invitations, click :guilabel:`Users`. The 
invitee's role appears as :guilabel:`--invite sent--`. To cancel an 
invitation, click :guilabel:`Cancel Invite`.

Remove Users
------------

.. important::

   You cannot delete the last user in a group. You must instead 
   *close the group*. To close your group:
   
   1. Click :guilabel:`Settings`.
   #. Click :guilabel:`Billing/Subscriptions`.
   #. Click :guilabel:`Close Group` at the bottom of the page.
    
   You cannot delete the last user with an :guilabel:`Owner` role from a
   group. You must first assign the role to at least one other user 
   before deleting the original user.

Assign Roles to Users
---------------------

Assign roles to |service| users to enable them to perform actions and
view data in a group. For information on the roles available in
|service|, see :ref:`Roles <atlas_roles>`.

To assign roles to users in a group, you must have the :guilabel:`Owner`
role in the group. The user who creates a group is automatically 
assigned :guilabel:`Owner` role.

To assign roles inside of |service|:
