.. dbcommand:: replSetFreeze

   The :dbcommand:`replSetFreeze` command prevents a replica set
   member from seeking election for the specified number of
   seconds. Use this command in conjunction with the
   :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` command to make a different node in
   the replica set a primary.

   The :dbcommand:`replSetFreeze` command uses the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetFreeze: <seconds> }

   If you want to unfreeze a replica set member before the specified number
   of seconds has elapsed, you can issue the command with a seconds
   value of ``0``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetFreeze: 0 }

   Restarting the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process also unfreezes a replica
   set member.

   :dbcommand:`replSetFreeze` is an administrative command, and you
   must issue it against the :term:`admin database`.
