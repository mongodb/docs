Overview
--------

MongoDB supports two types of clusters: :term:`replica sets
<replica set>` and :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`.
A sharded cluster can contain replica sets within it: each shard can be a
replica set and the config server can also be a replica set.
These relationships are reflected in the
way |mms| models clusters, and it might lead to unexpected results from
the **Clusters** resource. As an example, consider a deployment with one
sharded cluster containing four shards, and each shard is a three-node
replica set. In this scenario, the **Clusters** resource will return
five entities: one that represents the sharded cluster, and four to
represent the replica sets (shards). However, if each shard in this
fictitious deployment was a standalone :program:`mongod` instead of a
replica set, then the **Clusters** resource would only return one entity
representing the sharded cluster.

Endpoints
---------

Get All Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get all clusters in a group.

.. code-block:: http

   GET /groups/GROUP-ID/clusters

Use the ``parentClusterId`` query parameter to get all clusters with the
specified parent cluster ID. The list of entities is sorted in ascending
order by the date that |mms| discovered the cluster.

Get a Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get a single cluster by ID.

.. code-block:: http

   GET /groups/GROUP-ID/clusters/CLUSTER-ID

Update a Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update a cluster by ID. The only property that you may modify is the
``clusterName``, since |mms| discovers all other cluster properties.
This operation is only available on clusters of
type ``SHARDED`` and ``SHARDED_REPLICA_SET``.

.. code-block:: none

   PATCH /groups/GROUP-ID/clusters/CLUSTER-ID

Sample Entity
-------------

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "id": "yyy",
     "groupId": "xxx",
     "typeName": "REPLICA_SET",
     "clusterName": "Cluster 0",
     "shardName": "shard001",
     "replicaSetName": "rs1",
     "lastHeartbeat": "2014-02-26T17:32:45Z",
     "links" : []
   }

Entity Fields
-------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 10 80
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Name
     - Type
     - Description
   * - id
     - string
     - Unique identifier.
   * - groupId
     - string
     - Unique identifier of the group that owns this cluster.
   * - typeName
     - string
     - Specifies what kind of cluster this is. Possible values are:

       - ``REPLICA_SET``

       - ``SHARDED``: a sharded cluster where each shard is a :term:`standalone` instance. No shards
         are replica sets.

       - ``SHARDED_REPLICA_SET``: a sharded cluster that contains at least one shard that is a replica set.

       - ``CONFIG_SERVER_REPLICA_SET``: config servers deployed as a replica set.

       - ``MASTER_SLAVE``

   * - clusterName
     - string
     - Display name of the cluster. Only applies to sharded clusters. Note that
       ``mongod`` itself doesn't allow you to name a cluster; this name is
       supplied by (and editable within) |mms|. For a replica set within a sharded
       cluster, the cluster name is the name of its parent cluster.
   * - shardName
     - string
     - Name of the shard. Only present for a cluster of type ``SHARDED`` or
       ``REPLICA_SET`` that is part of a sharded cluster.
   * - replicaSetName
     - string
     - Name of the replica set. Only present for a cluster of type
       ``REPLICA_SET`` or ``CONFIG_SERVER_REPLICA_SET``.
   * - lastHeartbeat
     - date
     - The approximate last time |mms| processed a ping from this cluster.

Links
-----

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Relation
     - Description
   * - self
     - Me
   * - ``http://mms.mongodb.com/parentCluster``
     - The parent cluster. Only present if the type is ``SHARDED`` or
       ``REPLICA_SET`` within a sharded cluster.
   * - ``http://mms.mongodb.com/group``
     - The group that this cluster belongs to.
   * - ``http://mms.mongodb.com/clusters``
     - The member shards that belong to this cluster. Only present if the type
       is ``SHARDED_REPLICA_SET``.
   * - ``http://mms.mongodb.com/hosts``
     - The member hosts that belong to this cluster. Present for all types
       except ``SHARDED_REPLICA_SET``. Note: to get the hosts of a sharded
       cluster, follow the ``clusters`` link and get the ``hosts`` for each
       shard.
