   Views exhibit the following behavior:

   Read Only
   ~~~~~~~~~

   Views are read-only; write operations on views will error.
   
   The following read operations can support views:
      
   - :method:`db.collection.find()`
   - :method:`db.collection.findOne()`
   - :method:`db.collection.aggregate()`
   - :method:`db.collection.count()`
   - :method:`db.collection.distinct()`

   Index Use and Sort Operations
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - Views use the indexes of the underlying collection.

   - As the indexes are on the underlying collection, you cannot
     create, drop or re-build indexes on the view directly nor get a
     list of indexes on the view.

   - .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-unsupported-natural-sort.rst

     For example, the following operation is *invalid*:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.view.find().sort({$natural: 1})
   
   Projection Restrictions
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-unsupported-projection-operators.rst

   Immutable Name
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-unsupported-rename.rst

   View Creation
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
   - Views are computed on demand during read operations, and MongoDB
     executes read operations on views as part of the underlying
     aggregation pipeline. As such, views do not support operations
     such as:

     - :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()`,

     - :query:`$text` operator, since ``$text`` operation in
       aggregation is valid only for the first stage,

     - :dbcommand:`geoNear` command and :pipeline:`$geoNear` pipeline stage.

   - If the aggregation pipeline used to create the view suppresses the
     ``_id`` field, documents in the view do not have the ``_id`` field.

   Sharded View
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
   Views are considered sharded if their underlying collection is
   sharded. As such, you cannot specify a sharded view for the ``from``
   field in :pipeline:`$lookup` and :pipeline:`$graphLookup` operations.

   Views and Collation
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ref: views-collation-behavior
content: |

   - You can specify a default :doc:`collation </reference/collation>`
     for a view at creation time. If no collation is specified, the
     view's default collation is the "simple" binary comparison
     collator. That is, the view does not inherit the collection's
     default collation.

   - String comparisons on the view use the view's default collation.
     An operation that attempts to change or override a view's default
     collation will fail with an error.

   - If creating a view from another view, you cannot specify a
     collation that differs from the source view's collation.

   - .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-collation-agg.rst

ref: views-collation-agg
content: |

   If performing an aggregation that involves multiple views, such as
   with :pipeline:`$lookup` or :pipeline:`$graphLookup`, the views must
   have the same :doc:`collation  </reference/collation>`.
---
ref: views-public-definition
content: |
   The view definition is public; i.e. :method:`db.getCollectionInfos()`
   and ``explain`` operations on the view will include the pipeline that
   defines the view. As such, avoid referring directly to sensitive fields
   and values in view definitions.
