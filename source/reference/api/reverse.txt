Description
-----------

Reverses the direction of a committed sync operation.

For example:

- You have a ``COMMITTED`` sync operation.

- ``cluster0`` is the source and ``cluster1`` is the destination.

- After the sync operation is ``COMMITTED``, new writes occur only on
  the destination cluster. The source cluster will not accept new
  writes.

In this scenario, you can use the ``reverse`` endpoint to sync writes
from ``cluster1`` to ``cluster0``.

Requirements
------------

To use the ``reverse`` endpoint:

- ``mongosync`` must be configured when the initial sync begins. The
  call to the :ref:`/start <c2c-api-start>` API endpoint must set:
  
  - ``reversible`` to ``true``
  - ``enableUserWriteBlocking`` to ``true``
  
  You cannot update these options after the sync starts.
- ``mongosync`` must be in the ``COMMITTED`` state.
- Source and destination clusters must be MongoDB 6.0 or later.
- :ref:`index-type-unique` require proper formatting.  Collections with indexes
  initially created on MongoDB 4.2 may not have the proper formatting. 
  
  To validate that collection indexes use the proper formatting, see
  :ref:`c2c-validate-unique-index`.

Validate Unique Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to reverse direction, ``mongosync`` requires that all
:ref:`unique <index-type-unique>` indexes use the correct formatting. 
Clusters that began with MongoDB 4.2 or older and were since
upgraded may include unique indexes that are not properly formatted.

To correct indexes, you can :ref:`resync <resync-replica-member>` all nodes
in the original source cluster.  To resync all nodes: 

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Resync all secondaries, one by one. 

      For a tutorial on resyncing nodes, see :ref:`Resync a Member of a
      Replica Set <resync-replica-member>`. 

   .. step:: Step down the primary node and step up one of the secondary nodes.
   
   .. step:: Resync the old primary node from the new primary node. 

Alternatively, to avoid resyncing, you can use the
:method:`db.collection.validate` method with ``full = false`` on each
collection with unique indexes on all nodes to determine whether each
collection contains improperly formatted unique indexes. If
:method:`db.collection.validate` does not return a warning about a
unique index, you can skip resyncing. 

Request

.. code-block:: http
   :copyable: false

   POST /api/v1/reverse 

Request Body Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: includes/api/facts/no-body-parameters.rst

Response
--------

.. include:: /includes/api/tables/basic-response.rst

Example
-------

The following example reverses the direction of a committed sync operation.

Request
~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: /includes/api/requests/reverse.sh
   :language: shell

Response
~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: /includes/api/responses/success.json
   :language: json
   :copyable: false

Behavior
--------

If the ``reverse`` request is successful, ``mongosync`` enters the
``RUNNING`` state. The synchronization continues in the reverse
direction from the original sync job. You do not need to restart the
entire sync process to copy the original data.

To view the mapping direction for the synchronization of the source and
destination clusters, use the :ref:`progress <c2c-api-progress>`
endpoint and check the ``directionMapping`` object.
