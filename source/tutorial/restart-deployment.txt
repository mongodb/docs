If |a-mms|-managed MongoDB process isn't currently running, restart it
from the |mms| console.

To restart a running :term:`standalone` process, :term:`replica set`,
or :term:`sharded cluster`, see :doc:`Restart a Running Deployment
</tutorial/restart-running-deployment>`.

.. note::

   If |mms| Automation manages a |mongos| process and that process
   remains unreachable for 30 days, |mms| removes that process from the
   :guilabel:`Deployment` tab view. If you restart the |mongos|
   process, |mms| detects it again. To learn more, see the
   :alert:`host is down <HOST_DOWN>` alert.
