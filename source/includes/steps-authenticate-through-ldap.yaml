title: Authenticate the user in the ``mongo`` shell.
stepnum: 1
ref: authenticate
pre: |
  To perform the authentication in the :program:`mongo` shell, use the
  :method:`db.auth()` method in the ``$external`` database.
action:
  pre: |
    Specify the value ``"PLAIN"`` in the ``mechanism`` field, the user and
    password in the ``user`` and ``pwd`` fields respectively, and the
    value ``false`` in the ``digestPassword`` field. You **must** specify
    ``false`` for ``digestPassword`` since the server must receive an
    undigested password to forward on to ``saslauthd``, as in the
    following example:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    db.getSiblingDB("$external").auth(
       {
         mechanism: "PLAIN",
         user: <username>,
         pwd:  <cleartext password>,
         digestPassword: false
       }
    )
post:
  The server forwards the password in plain text. In general, use only on
  a trusted channel (VPN, SSL, trusted wired network).
