title: Configure the package management system (``zypper``).
stepnum: 1
ref: config-yum
pre: |
  Add the repository so that you can install MongoDB using ``zypper``.
action:
  - pre: |
      Use the following command to specify the *latest* stable release of MongoDB.
    language: sh
    code: |
      zypper addrepo --no-gpgcheck https://repo.mongodb.org/zypper/suse/11/mongodb-org/3.0/x86_64/ mongodb
  - pre: |
      This repository only offers the ``3.0`` MongoDB release.  If you'd like
      to install MongoDB packages from a previous :ref:`release
      series <release-version-numbers>`, such as 2.6, you can
      specify the release series in the repository configuration. For
      example, to restrict your system to the 2.6 release series,
      use the following command:
    language: sh
    code: |
      zypper addrepo --no-gpgcheck http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/suse/os/x86_64/ mongodb
---
title: Install the MongoDB packages and associated tools.
stepnum: 2
ref: install
pre: |
  When you install the packages, you choose whether to install the current
  release or a previous one. This step provides the commands for both.
action:
  - pre: |
      To install the latest stable version of MongoDB, issue the following
      command:
    language: sh
    code: |
      sudo zypper install mongodb-org
  - pre: |
      To install a specific release of MongoDB, specify each
      component package individually and append the version number to the
      package name, as in the following example:

      .. include:: /includes/release/pin-repo-suse.rst
  - pre: |
      You can specify any available version of MongoDB. However ``zypper``
      will upgrade the packages when a newer version becomes available. To
      prevent unintended upgrades, pin the packages by running the following
      command:

      .. include:: /includes/release/pin-repo-suse-lock.rst
post: |
  Previous versions of MongoDB packages use a different repository location.
  Refer to the version of the documentation appropriate for
  your MongoDB version.
