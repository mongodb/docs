Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: distinct

   Finds the distinct values for a specified field across a single
   collection. :dbcommand:`distinct` returns a document that contains
   an array of the distinct values. The return document also contains
   a subdocument with query statistics and the query plan.

   When possible, the :dbcommand:`distinct` command uses an index to
   find documents and return values.

   The command takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { distinct: "<collection>", key: "<field>", query: <query> }

   The command contains the following fields:

   .. include:: /reference/command/distinct-field.rst

Examples
--------

Return an array of the distinct values of the field ``ord_dt`` from all
documents in the ``orders`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand ( { distinct: "orders", key: "ord_dt" } )

Return an array of the distinct values of the field ``sku`` in the
subdocument ``item`` from all documents in the ``orders`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand ( { distinct: "orders", key: "item.sku" } )

Return an array of the distinct values of the field ``ord_dt`` from the
documents in the ``orders`` collection where the ``price`` is greater
than ``10``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand ( { distinct: "orders", 
                     key: "ord_dt",
                     query: { price: { $gt: 10 } }
                   } )

.. note::

   MongoDB also provides the shell wrapper method
   :method:`db.collection.distinct()` for the :dbcommand:`distinct`
   command. Additionally, many MongoDB :term:`drivers <driver>` also
   provide a wrapper method. Refer to the specific driver
   documentation.
