What You Need
-------------

Before you can use {+csfle-abbrev+}, you must set up the following items
in your development environment:

.. tabs-selector:: drivers

.. tabs-drivers::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: java-sync

      .. include:: /includes/set-up/cross-driver-steps.rst

      - Install `mongodb-crypt <https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mongodb/mongodb-crypt>`__.
        The ``mongodb-crypt`` library contains bindings to communicate
        with the native library that manages the encryption.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: nodejs

      .. include:: /includes/set-up/cross-driver-steps.rst

      - Install `mongodb-client-encryption <https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb-client-encryption>`__,
        a Node.js wrapper for the ``libmongocrypt`` encryption library.
        The ``libmongocrypt`` library contains bindings to communicate
        with the native library that manages the encryption.

      .. include:: /includes/in-use-encryption/node-mongodb-client-encryption-note.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: python

      .. include:: /includes/set-up/cross-driver-steps.rst

      - Install `pymongocrypt <https://pypi.org/project/pymongocrypt/>`__, a Python
        wrapper for the ``libmongocrypt`` encryption library.
        The ``libmongocrypt`` library contains bindings to communicate
        with the native library that manages the encryption.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: csharp

      .. include:: /includes/set-up/cross-driver-steps.rst

      - Ensure that you're using an x64 operating system. {+csfle-abbrev+} requires
        x64 support.

      .. include:: /includes/installation/libmongocrypt-csharp.rst
    
   .. tab::
      :tabid: go

      .. include:: /includes/set-up/cross-driver-steps.rst

      - Install :ref:`libmongocrypt <csfle-reference-libmongocrypt>`.
        The ``libmongocrypt`` library contains bindings to communicate
        with the native library that manages the encryption.
