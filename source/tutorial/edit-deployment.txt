You can modify a deployment's configuration and topology, including its
MongoDB versions, storage engines, and numbers of hosts or shards. You
can make modifications at all levels of a deployment's topology from a
top-level :manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>` or
:manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` to lower levels, such as a replica set within a
sharded cluster, or an individual process within a replica set. You can
also modify :term:`standalone <standalone>` processes.

Considerations
--------------

- You can't change individual members of a replica set or sharded cluster.
  You can change only the whole set or cluster.

- If a setting isn't available for a MongoDB resource, you can make changes
  using only the :opsmgr:`Ops Manager </>` or :cloudmgr:`Cloud Manager </>` application.

- You can configure certain settings using only the |k8s-op-short|. To
  review the list of settings, see :doc:`/reference/k8s-op-exclusive-settings`.
