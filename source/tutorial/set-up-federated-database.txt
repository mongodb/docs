This page guides you through the steps for creating a federated 
database instance for you {+dl+} dataset.

Prerequisites 
-------------

Before you begin, you must have the following: 

- An {+adl+} dataset in the same project where you intend to create the 
  federated database instance.
- :authrole:`Project Owner` role for the project where you want to 
  create the federated database instance.

Procedure 
---------

.. procedure:: 

   .. step:: Navigate to {+adf+} in the |service| UI. 

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/ui-nav-adf.rst 

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Create Federated Database`.

   .. step:: Select the configuration method. 

      - For a guided experience, enable :guilabel:`Visual Editor`. (Default)
      - To edit the raw |json|, disable :guilabel:`Visual Editor`.

   .. step:: Create virtual databases, collections, and views and map them to your {+dl+} dataset.

      Follow the steps in the tab below for your preferred Editor view 
      in the UI.

      .. tabs:: 

         .. tab:: Visual Editor 
            :tabid: visual

            a. (Optional) Click the :icon-fa4:`pencil` for the:
  
               - :guilabel:`Federated Database Instance` to specify a 
                 name for your federated database instance. Defaults to 
                 ``FederatedDatabaseInstance[n]``. 

               - Database to edit the database name. Defaults to 
                 ``Database[n]``. 

                 Corresponds to ``databases.[n].name`` |json| 
                 configuration setting.
          
               - Collection to edit the collection name. Defaults to 
                 ``Collection[n]``. 
       
                 Corresponds to ``databases.[n].collections.name`` 
                 |json| configuration setting.
     
               - View to edit the view name. 
            
               You can click: 
     
               - :guilabel:`Add Database` to add databases and 
                 collections. 
               - :icon-fa4:`plus` associated with the database to 
                 add collections to the database. 
               - :icon-fa4:`plus` associated with the collection to 
                 add :manual:`views </core/views/>` on the 
                 collection. To create a view, you must specify: 
       
                 - The name of the view.
                 - The :manual:`pipeline </core/aggregation-pipeline/#std-label-aggregation-pipeline>` 
                   to apply to the view.

                   .. note:: 

                      The view definition pipeline can't include the 
                      ``$out`` or the ``$merge`` stage. If the view 
                      definition includes nested pipeline stages such 
                      as ``$lookup`` or ``$facet``, this restriction 
                      applies to those nested pipelines as well.

                   To learn more about views, see: 

                   - :manual:`Views </core/views/>`
                   - :manual:`db.createView </reference/method/db.createView/>`
               
                 - :icon-fa4:`trash-o` associated with the database, 
                   collection, or view to remove it.

               .. note:: 

                  The :ref:`sample queries <adl-run-queries>` that you 
                  can run later in this tutorial use the names 
                  ``Database0`` for the virtual database name and 
                  ``Collection0`` for the virtual collection name. If 
                  you modify the names here, make sure to modify the 
                  names in the sample queries also before you run them.

            #. Drag and drop the :guilabel:`Data Lake Dataset` to map  
               with the collection.

               .. example:: 
                 
                  If you are creating a {+fdi+} for 
                  the {+adl+} dataset that you created for the sample 
                  data using the examples in :ref:`adl-add-pipeline`: 
                  
                  i. Under :guilabel:`Datasets`, select 
                     :guilabel:`Ingestion Pipeline` from the dropdown 
                     if it isn't already selected. 
                  #. Under :guilabel:`Data Lake Dataset` section, drag 
                     the dataset named ``sample_mflix.movies`` and drop 
                     it under the collection.
             
               Corresponds to 
               ``databases.[n].collections.[n].dataSources`` |json| 
               configuration setting.

         .. tab:: JSON Editor 
            :tabid: json

            a. Define your dataset as a data store in your {+fdi+} 
               storage configuration.

               Edit the |json| configuration settings shown in the UI 
               for ``stores``. Your ``stores`` cofiguration setting 
               should resemble the following:

               .. code-block:: json 

                  {
                    "stores": [
                      {
                        "name": "<store-name>",
                        "provider": "<cloud-storage-provider-name>",
                        "region": "<cloud-storage-provider-region>"
                      }
                    ]
                  }

               To learn more about these settings, see :atlas:`Storage 
               Configuration For Atlas Data Lake Datasets 
               </data-federation/config/config-adl-datasets/#stores>`.

               .. example:: 
                 
                  If you are creating a {+fdi+} for 
                  the {+adl+} pipeline that you created for the sample 
                  data using the examples in :ref:`adl-add-pipeline`, 
                  replace the ``stores`` in the |json| configuration 
                  settings shown in the UI with the following: 

                  .. code-block:: json

                           "region": "US_EAST_1"
                         }
                       ]
                     }

            #. Define virtual databases, collections, and views for 
               your dataset in the {+adf+} storage configuration.

                              }
                            ]

Now that you've created a {+fdi+} for your {+dl+} 
dataset, proceed to :ref:`adl-connect-federated-db-instance`.
