Overview 
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to specify a query in the MongoDB Java
driver.

Most CRUD operations allow you to narrow the set of matched documents by
specifying matching criteria in a **query filter**. Query filters
contain one or more query operators that apply to specific fields which
determine which documents to include in the result set. 

In this page, we cover the following query operators with
examples on how to use them: 

- :ref:`Comparison Operators <query-comparison>`
- :ref:`Logical Operators <query-logical>`
- :ref:`Array Operators <query-arrays>`
- :ref:`Element Operators <query-elements>`
- :ref:`Evaluation Operators <query-evaluation>`

The examples in this guide use the following documents in the
``paint_purchases`` collection: 

.. code-block:: json

    { "_id": 1, "color": "red", "qty": 9, "vendor": ["A", "E"] }
    { "_id": 2, "color": "purple", "qty": 8, "vendor": ["B", "D", "F"], "rating": 5 } 
    { "_id": 3, "color": "blue", "qty": 5, "vendor": ["A", "E"] }
    { "_id": 4, "color": "white", "qty": 6, "vendor": ["D"], "rating": 9 }
    { "_id": 5, "color": "yellow", "qty": 4, "vendor": ["A", "B"] }
    { "_id": 6, "color": "pink", "qty": 3, "vendor": ["C"] }
    { "_id": 7, "color": "green", "qty": 8, "vendor": ["C", "E"], "rating": 7 }
    { "_id": 8, "color": "black", "qty": 7, "vendor": ["A", "C", "D"] }
       
.. _query-comparison:

Comparison Operators
--------------------

Comparison operators query data based on comparisons with values in a
collection. Common comparison operators include ``gt()`` for "greater
than" comparisons, ``lte()`` for "less than or equal to" comparisons,
and ``ne()`` for "not equal to " comparisons. 

The following example uses the ``Filters.gt()`` method to match all
documents where the value of ``qty`` is greater than ``7`` in the
``paint_purchases`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Query.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin comparisonFilter
   :end-before: end comparisonFilter

The following shows the output of the preceding query:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

    { "_id": 1, "color": "red", "qty": 9, "vendor": ["A", "E"] }
    { "_id": 2, "color": "purple", "qty": 8, "vendor": ["B", "D", "F"], "rating": 5 }
    { "_id": 7, "color": "green", "qty": 8, "vendor": ["C", "E"], "rating": 7 }

.. _query-logical:

Logical Operators
-----------------

Logical operators query data using logic applied to the results of
field-level operators. Common logical operators include ``and()`` where
all operators must be true, and ``or()`` where at least one of the
operators must be true.

The following example uses the ``Filters.and()`` method to match
documents where the value of ``qty`` is less than or equal to ``5`` and
the value of ``color`` is not ``"pink"`` in the ``paint_purchases``
collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Query.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin logicalFilter
   :end-before: end logicalFilter

The following shows the output of the preceding query:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

    { "_id": 3, "color": "blue", "qty": 5, "vendor": ["A", "E"] }
    { "_id": 5, "color": "yellow", "qty": 4, "vendor": ["A", "B"] }

.. _query-arrays:

Array Operators
---------------

Array operators query data based on the value or quantity of elements in
an array field. 

The following example uses the ``Filters.size()`` method to match
documents where the size of the ``vendor`` list is ``3`` in the
``paint_purchases`` collection: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Query.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin arrayFilter
   :end-before: end arrayFilter

The following shows the output of the preceding query:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

    { "_id": 2, "color": "purple", "qty": 8, "vendor": ["B", "D", "F"], "rating": 5 }
    { "_id": 8, "color": "black", "qty": 7, "vendor": ["A", "C", "D"] }

.. _query-elements:

Element Operators
-----------------

Element operators query data based on the presence or type of a field.  

The following example uses the ``Filters.exists()`` method to match
documents that have a ``rating`` in the ``paint_purchases`` collection: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Query.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin elementFilter
   :end-before: end elementFilter

The following shows the output of the preceding query:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

    { "_id": 2, "color": "purple", "qty": 8, "vendor": ["B", "D", "F"], "rating": 5 }
    { "_id": 4, "color": "white", "qty": 6, "vendor": ["D"], "rating": 9 }
    { "_id": 7, "color": "green", "qty": 8, "vendor": ["C", "E"], "rating": 7 }

.. _query-evaluation:

Evaluation Operators
--------------------

Evaluation operators query data on higher level logic, like regex
and text searches. 

The following example uses the ``Filters.regex()`` method to match
documents that have a ``color`` ending with the letter ``"k"`` in the
``paint_purchases`` collection:  

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Query.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin evaluationFilter
   :end-before: end evaluationFilter

The following shows the output of the preceding query:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

    { "_id": 6, "color": "pink", "qty": 3, "vendor": ["C"] }
    { "_id": 8, "color": "black", "qty": 7, "vendor": ["A", "C", "D"] }
