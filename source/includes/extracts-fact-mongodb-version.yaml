   |service| supports MongoDB 3.2 and MongoDB 3.4 with the
   :ref:`WiredTiger storage engine <storage-wiredtiger>`. By default,
   |service| uses MongoDB 3.4.  You can specify the MongoDB version when
   you :doc:`create a cluster <create-new-cluster>`. If a created
   cluster uses MongoDB 3.2, you can upgrade to MongoDB 3.4 when you
   :doc:`scale a cluster <scale-cluster>`.

   As new maintenance releases become available, |service|
   automatically upgrades to these releases via a rolling process to
   maintain cluster availability.
