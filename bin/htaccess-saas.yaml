# - 'all': Generates redirects for all published branches, but *not* 'manual'.
#
# - 'before-<branch>': generates redirects for all branches that

#
# - 'after-<branch>': generates redirects for all branches that
#   reflect releases after the specified branch. (Non-inclusive.)

# All paths are relative to the ``source/`` directory.
