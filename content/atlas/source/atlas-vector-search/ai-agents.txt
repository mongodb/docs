What is an AI agent?
--------------------

In the context of generative AI, an AI agent 
typically refers to a system that can complete a task 
autonomously or semi-autonomously by combining 
AI models such as |llm|\s with a set of 
pre-defined tools.

AI agents can use tools to gather context, 
interact with external systems, and perform actions.
They can define their own execution flow (planning) 
and remember previous interactions to inform their responses 
(memory). Therefore, AI agents are best suited for complex
tasks that require reasoning, planning, and decision-making.

Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~

An AI agent typically includes a combination 
of the following components:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80

   * - **Perception**
     - Your input for the agent.
       Text inputs are the most common perception 
       mechanism for AI agents, but inputs can also be audio, 
       images, or multimodal data.

   * - **Planning**
     - How the agent determines what to do next.
       This component typically includes LLMs and prompts, using 
       feedback loops and various `prompt engineering techniques 
       <https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques>`__ such as chain-of-thought and 
       reAct, to help the LLM reason through complex tasks.

       AI agents can consist of a single LLM as the decision maker, 
       LLM with multiple prompts, multiple LLMs working together,
       or any combination of these approaches.

   * - **Tools**
     - How the agent gathers context for a task. Tools allow
       agents to interact with external systems and perform actions
       such as vector search, web search, or calling APIs
       from other services.

   * - **Memory**
     - A system for storing agent interactions, so
       the agent can learn from past experiences to inform its responses.
       Memory can be *short-term* (for the current session) or *long-term*
       (persisted across sessions).

.. note::

   AI agents vary in design pattern, function, and complexity.

Build AI Agents with MongoDB
----------------------------

MongoDB supports the following components
for building AI agents:

- :ref:`Tools <avs-agent-tools>`: Leverage MongoDB search features as 
  tools for your agent to retrieve relevant information and implement agentic RAG.
- :ref:`Memory <avs-agent-memory>`: Store agent interactions in MongoDB collections
  for both short and long-term memory.

.. _avs-agent-tools:


Agent Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. collapsible::
   :heading: What is a tool?
   :expanded: false

   In the context of AI agents, a tool is anything that can be programmatically defined 
   and invoked by the agent. Tools extend the agent's capabilities beyond generating text, 
   allowing it to interact with external systems, retrieve information, and take actions.
   Tools are typically defined with a specific interface that includes:

   - A name and description that help the agent understand when to use the tool.
   - Required parameters and their expected formats.
   - A function that performs the actual operation when invoked.

   The agent uses its reasoning capabilities to determine which tool to use, when to use it, 
   and what parameters to provide, based on the user's input and the task at hand.
      
In addition to standard MongoDB queries, MongoDB provides several 
search capabilities that you can implement as tools for your agent.

- **{+avs+}**: Perform vector search to retrieve relevant context based on
  semantic meaning and similarity. To learn more, see :ref:`avs-overview`.
- **{+fts+}**: Perform full-text search to retrieve relevant context based on
  keyword matching and relevance scoring. To learn more, see
  :ref:`atlas-search`.
- **Hybrid Search**: Combine {+avs+} with |fts| to leverage the strengths of
  both approaches. To learn more, see :ref:`as_hybrid-search`.

You can define tools manually or by using :ref:`frameworks <ai-integrations>`
such as LangChain and LangGraph, which provide built-in abstractions for tool
creation and calling.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Tool definition
      :tabid: tool-def

      Tools are defined as functions that the agent can call to perform specific tasks.
      For example, the following syntax illustrates how you might define a 
      tool that runs a :ref:`vector search query <return-vector-search-results>`:

      .. tabs-drivers::
        
         .. tab::
            :tabid: python
    
            .. code-block:: python

               def vector_search_tool(query: str) -> str:
                  pipeline = [
                      {
                          "$vectorSearch": {
                              # Vector search query pipeline...
                          }
                      }
                  ]
                  results = collection.aggregate(pipeline)

                  array_of_results = []
                  for doc in results:
                      array_of_results.append(doc)
                  return array_of_results
        
         .. tab::
            :tabid: nodejs

            .. code-block:: javascript

               async function vectorSearchTool(query) {  
                  const pipeline = [  
                      {  
                          $vectorSearch: {  
                              // Vector search query pipeline...  
                          }  
                      }       
                  ];  

                  const results = await collection.aggregate(pipeline).toArray();  
                  return results;  
              }

   .. tab:: Tool call
      :tabid: tool-call

      Tool calls are what the agent uses to execute the tools. You can define
      how to process tool calls in your agent, or 
      use a framework to handle this for you. These are typically defined 
      as JSON objects that include the tool name and other arguments to pass to the 
      tool, so the agent can call the tool with the appropriate parameters. 
      For example, the following syntax illustrates how an agent might call the 
      vector search tool:
    
      .. code-block:: none

         {
          "tool": "vector_search_tool",
          "args": { "query": "What is MongoDB?" },
          "id": "call_H5TttXb423JfoulF1qVfPN3m"
         }


.. _agentic-rag:

Agentic RAG
```````````

By using MongoDB as a vector database, you can create retrieval tools
that implement agentic RAG, which is an advanced form of :ref:`RAG
<avs-rag>` that allows you to dynamically orchestrate the retrieval and
generation process through an AI agent.

.. figure:: /images/avs/agentic-rag-diagram.svg
   :alt: Diagram showing an agentic RAG architecture with MongoDB
   :figwidth: 100%

This approach enables more complex workflows and user interactions. For
example, you can configure your AI agent to determine the optimal
retrieval tool based on the task, such as using {+avs+} for semantic
search and {+fts+} for full-text search. You can also define different
retrieval tools for different collections to further customize the agent's
retrieval capabilities.

.. _avs-agent-memory:

Agent Memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. collapsible::
   :heading: What is memory?
   :expanded: false

   Memory for agents involves storing information about previous
   interactions, so that the agent can learn from past experiences and
   provide more relevant and personalized responses. This is particularly
   important for tasks that require context, such as conversational
   agents, where the agent needs to remember previous turns in the
   conversation to provide coherent and contextually relevant responses.
   There are two primary types of agent memory:

   - **Short-term Memory**: Stores information for the current session, 
     like recent conversation turns and active task context.
   - **Long-term Memory**: Persists information across sessions, 
     which can include past conversations and personalized preferences
     over time.

Since MongoDB is also a document database, you can
implement memory for agents by storing its interactions 
in a MongoDB collection. The agent can then query or update
this collection as needed. There are several ways to implement 
agent memory with MongoDB:

- For short-term memory, you might include a ``session_id`` field
  to identify a specific session when storing interactions, and then 
  query for interactions with the same ID to pass to the agent as context.

- For long-term memory, you might process several interactions with an LLM
  to extract relevant information such as user preferences or
  important context, and then store this information in a separate
  collection that the agent can query when needed.

- To build robust memory management systems that enable 
  more efficient and complex retrieval of conversation histories, 
  leverage :ref:`{+fts+} <atlas-search>` or :ref:`{+avs+} <avs-overview>`
  to store, index, and query important interactions across sessions.

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Short-term memory
      :tabid: short-term

      A document in a collection that stores short-term memory might 
      resemble the following:
      
      .. code-block:: none

        {
          "session_id": "123",
          "user_id": "jane_doe",
          "interactions": 
          [ 
            {
              "role": "user",
              "content": "What is MongoDB?",
              "timestamp": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z"
            },
            {
              "role": "assistant",
              "content": "MongoDB is the world's leading modern database.",
              "timestamp": "2025-01-01T12:00:05Z"
            }
          ]
        }

  .. tab:: Long-term memory
      :tabid: long-term

      A document in a collection that stores long-term memory might 
      resemble the following:
          
      .. code-block:: none

        {
          "user_id": "jane_doe",
          "last_updated": "2025-05-22T09:15:00Z",
          "preferences": {
            "conversation_tone": "casual",
            "custom_instructions": [
              "I prefer concise answers."
            ],
          },
          "facts": [
            {
              "interests": ["AI", "MongoDB"],
            }
          ]
        }
