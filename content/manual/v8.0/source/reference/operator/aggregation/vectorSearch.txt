$vectorSearch (aggregation)
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Definition
----------

.. important:: 

   The ``$vectorSearch`` aggregation pipeline stage is only available
   for collections hosted on :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>` cluster tiers 
   running MongoDB version 6.0.11 or later. To learn more, see 
   :atlas:`Atlas Vector Search
   </atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/>`. 

.. expression:: $vectorSearch

   ``$vectorSearch`` performs a semantic search on data in your Atlas
   cluster. 
   
   If you store vector embeddings on your Atlas cluster, you can
   seamlessly index the vector data along with your other collection
   data. You can use the :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` stage to pre-filter
   your data and perform semantic search against the indexed fields. 

   Your vector data must be less than or equal to 4096 dimensions in
   width.

Behavior
--------

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, you can use a ``$vectorSearch`` stage in a
:pipeline:`$unionWith` stage. 

Limitations
-----------

You cannot use a ``$vectorSearch`` stage in a :pipeline:`$facet`
stage or a :pipeline:`$lookup` stage.
