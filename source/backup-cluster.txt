|service| continuously backs up your data, ensuring your backups are
typically just a few seconds behind the operational system. 

For each |service| project, the first cluster you enable backups for
dictates the backup method for all subsequent clusters in the
project. You cannot change the backup method without first deleting
all clusters *and*  snapshots in the project.

|service| supports two backup methods:

:doc:`/backup/continuous-backups`
  |service| uses incremental snapshots to continuously back up your 
  data. Continuous backup snapshots are typically just a few seconds 
  behind the operational system.

  |service| ensures point-in-time backup of replica sets and consistent,
  cluster-wide snapshots of sharded clusters. 

  For each |service| project with continuous snapshots enabled, 
  |service| stores the continuous backup snapshots in *one* backup data 
  center location dictated by the *first* backup-enabled cluster created 
  in that project. 

  Continuous snapshots support restoring from the full snapshot
  or from a point-in-time between snapshots. You can also
  :doc:`query a continuous snapshot </query-backup>`.

:doc:`/backup/cloud-provider-snapshots`
  .. important::

     :ref:`Azure <microsoft-azure>`-backed replica set clusters only.

  |service| takes full-copy snapshots of cluster data every 24 hours.

  |service| cloud provider snapshots are stored in the same region as
  the corresponding cluster. For multi-region clusters, snapshots are
  stored in the cluster's preferred region.
