.. dbcommand:: compact

   .. versionadded:: 2.0

   The :dbcommand:`compact` command rewrites and defragments a single
   collection. Additionally, the command drops all indexes at the
   beginning of compaction and rebuilds the indexes at the end.
   :dbcommand:`compact` is conceptually similar to
   :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`, but works on a single collection rather
   than an entire database.

   The command has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { compact: <collection name> }

   You may also specify the following options:

   :param force:

      .. versionchanged:: 2.2
         :dbcommand:`compact` blocks activities only for the database
         it is compacting.

      The ``force`` specifies whether the :dbcommand:`compact` command
      can run on the primary node in a :term:`replica set`. Set to
      ``true`` to run the :dbcommand:`compact` command on the primary
      node in a :term:`replica set`. Otherwise, the
      :dbcommand:`compact` command returns an error when invoked on a
      :term:`replica set` primary because the command blocks all other
      activity.

   :param paddingFactor:

      .. versionadded:: 2.2

      *Default:* ``1.0``

      *Minimum:* ``1.0`` (no padding.)

      *Maximum:* ``4.0``

      The ``paddingFactor`` describes the :term:`record size`
      allocated for each document as a factor of the document size,
      for all records compacted during the :dbcommand:`compact`
      operation. ``paddingFactor`` does not affect the padding of
      subsequent record allocations after :dbcommand:`compact`
      completes.

      If your updates increase the size of the documents,
      padding will increase the amount of space allocated to each
      document and avoid expensive document relocation operations
      within the data files.

      You can calculate the padding size by subtracting the document
      size from the record size or, in terms of the ``paddingFactor``,
      by subtracting ``1`` from the ``paddingFactor``:

      .. code-block:: none

         padding size = (paddingFactor - 1) * <document size>.

      For example, a ``paddingFactor`` of ``1.0`` specifies a padding
      size of ``0`` whereas a ``paddingFactor`` of ``1.2`` specifies a
      padding size of ``0.2`` or 20 percent (20%) of the document
      size.

      With the following command, you can use the ``paddingFactor``
      option of the :dbcommand:`compact` command to set the record
      size to ``1.1`` of the document size, or a padding factor of 10
      percent (10%):

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.runCommand ( { compact: '<collection>', paddingFactor: 1.1 } )

      :dbcommand:`compact` compacts existing documents, but does not
      reset ``paddingFactor`` statistics for the collection. After the
      :dbcommand:`compact` MongoDB will use the existing
      ``paddingFactor`` when allocating new records for documents in
      this collection.

   :param paddingBytes:

      .. versionadded:: 2.2

      The ``paddingBytes`` sets the padding as an absolute number of
      bytes, for all records compacted during the :dbcommand:`compact`
      operation. After running :dbcommand:`compact`, ``paddingBytes``
      does not affect the padding of subsequent record allocations.

      Specifying ``paddingBytes`` can be useful if your
      documents start small but then increase in size
      significantly.  For example,if your documents are initially
      40 bytes long and you grow them by 1KB, using
      ``paddingBytes: 1024`` might be reasonable since using
      ``paddingFactor: 4.0`` would specify a record size of 160
      bytes (``4.0`` times the initial document size), which would
      only provide a padding of 120 bytes (i.e.  record size of
      160 bytes minus the document size).

      With the following command, you can use the ``paddingBytes``
      option of the :dbcommand:`compact` command to set the
      padding size to ``100`` bytes on the collection named by
      ``<collection>``:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.runCommand ( { compact: '<collection>', paddingBytes: 100 } )

   .. warning:: Always have an up-to-date backup before performing
      server maintenance such as the :dbcommand:`compact` operation.

   Note the following behaviors:

   - :dbcommand:`compact` blocks all other activity. In MongoDB 2.2,
     :dbcommand:`compact` blocks activities only for its database. You
     may view the intermediate progress either by viewing the
     :binary:`~bin.mongod` log file, or by running the
     :method:`db.currentOp()` in another shell instance.

   - :dbcommand:`compact` compacts existing documents in the
     collection. However, unlike :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`,
     :dbcommand:`compact` does not reset ``paddingFactor`` statistics
     for the collection.  MongoDB will use the existing
     ``paddingFactor`` when allocating new records for documents in
     this collection.

   - :dbcommand:`compact` generally uses less disk space than
     :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` and is faster. However,the
     :dbcommand:`compact` command is still slow and does block other
     database use. Only use :dbcommand:`compact` during scheduled
     maintenance periods.

   - If you terminate the operation with the
     :method:`db.killOp() <db.killOp()>` method or restart the
     server before it has finished:

     - If you have journaling enabled, the data remains consistent and
       usable, regardless of the state of the :dbcommand:`compact`
       operation. You may have to manually rebuild the indexes.

     - If you do not have journaling enabled and the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
       or :dbcommand:`compact` terminates during the operation, it's
       impossible to guarantee that the data is in a consistent
       state.

     - In either case, much of the existing free space in the
       collection may become un-reusable. In this scenario, you should
       rerun the compaction to completion to restore the use of this free
       space.

   - :dbcommand:`compact` may increase the total size and number of our
     data files, especially when run for the first time. However, this
     will not increase the total collection storage space since storage
     size is the amount of data allocated within the database files,
     and not the size/number of the files on the file system.

   - :dbcommand:`compact` requires a small amount of additional disk
     space while running but unlike :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` it does
     *not* free space on the file system.

   - You may also wish to run the :dbcommand:`collStats` command before and
     after compaction to see how the storage space changes for the
     collection.

   - :dbcommand:`compact` commands do not replicate to secondaries in
     a :term:`replica set`:

     - Compact each member separately.

     - Ideally, compaction runs on a secondary. See option
       ``force:true`` above for information regarding compacting the
       primary.

     .. warning::

        If you run :dbcommand:`compact` on a secondary, the secondary
        will enter a ``RECOVERING`` state to prevent clients from
        sending read operations during compaction. Once the operation
        finishes the secondary will automatically return to
        ``SECONDARY`` state.  See :data:`~replSetGetStatus.members.state`
        for more information replica set member states. Refer to the
        "`partial script for automating step down and compaction`_"
        for an example of this procedure.

   - :dbcommand:`compact` is a command issued to a :binary:`~bin.mongod`.
     In a sharded environment, run :dbcommand:`compact` on each shard
     separately as a maintenance operation.

     .. important:: You cannot issue :dbcommand:`compact` against a
        :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

   - It is not possible to compact :term:`capped collections <capped
     collection>` because they don't have padding, and documents cannot
     grow in these collections. However, the documents of a
     :term:`capped collections <capped collection>` are not subject to
     fragmentation.

   - :dbcommand:`compact` removes extra padding added to collections
     that have the :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` flag set. See
     :issue:`SERVER-4018` for more information.
