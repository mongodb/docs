===============================
Upgrade MongoDB Version and FCV
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can upgrade the major, minor, and/or feature compatibility versions
of your MongoDB resource. These settings are configured in your
resource's |k8s-configmap|.

- To upgrade your resource's major and/or minor versions, set the
  :setting:`spec.version` setting to the desired MongoDB version.

- To modify your resource's
  :manual:`feature compatibility version </reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/>`,
  set the :setting:`spec.featureCompatibilityVersion` setting to the
  desired version.

.. note::

   If you update ``spec.version`` to a later version, consider setting
   :setting:`spec.featureCompatibilityVersion` to the current working
   MongoDB version to give yourself the option to downgrade if
   necessary.

   To learn more about feature compatibility, see
   :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` in the MongoDB Manual.

Example
-------

Consider the following |k8s-configmap| for a standalone resource:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   apiVersion: mongodb.com/v1
   kind: MongoDB
   metadata:
     name: my-standalone-downgrade
   spec:
     version: "4.0.14-ent"
     type: Standalone
     project: my-project
     credentials: my-credentials
     persistent: false
   ...

This resource has a MongoDB version of {+old-version-val+}. The
following steps upgrade the deployment's MongoDB version to ``4.2.2-ent``:
