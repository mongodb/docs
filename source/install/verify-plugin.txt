The MongoDB release team digitally signs |vsce| releases to certify that
the plugin is a valid and unaltered MongoDB release. You can use the
digital signature to validate the plugin and ensure that it is a trusted
installation.

Before you Begin
----------------

If you don't have |vsce| installed, download the |vsce| plugin from the
`GitHub Releases page <https://github.com/mongodb-js/vscode/releases>`__
or the Visual Studio Code extension marketplace.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Download the |vsce| signature file

      Go to the `MongoDB VS Code Releases page
      <https://github.com/mongodb-js/vscode/releases>`__ and download
      the ``.sig`` file for your version of |vsce|.

   .. step:: Import the |vsce| public key

      .. code-block:: sh

         curl https://pgp.mongodb.com/mongodb-vscode.asc | gpg --import

      If the key imports successfully, the command returns:

      .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: false

         gpg: key A8130EC3F9F5F923: public key "MongoDB VS Code Signing Key <vscode@mongodb.com>" imported
         gpg: Total number processed: 1
         gpg:               imported: 1

      If you have previously imported the key, the command returns:

      .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: false

         gpg: key A8130EC3F9F5F923: public key "MongoDB VS Code Signing Key <vscode@mongodb.com>" not changed
         gpg: Total number processed: 1
         gpg:              unchanged: 1
   
   .. step:: Verify the plugin

      .. code-block:: sh

         gpg --verify <path_to_signature_file> <path_to_plugin_vsix_file>
         
      If the plugin is signed by MongoDB, the command returns:
      
      .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: false

         gpg: Signature made Mon Jan  8 19:30:04 2024 CET
         gpg:                using RSA key A505CECC78EC9A688A4811505D55DCA8B92B7040
         gpg: Good signature from "MongoDB VS Code Signing Key <vscode@mongodb.com>" [unknown]
         
      If the package is signed but the signing key is not added to your
      local ``trustdb``, the command returns:

      .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: false

         gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
         gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
         
      If the package is not signed properly, the command returns an
      error message:

      .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: false

         gpg: Signature made Mon Jan 22 10:22:53 2024 CET
         gpg:                using RSA key AB1B92FFBE0D3740425DAD16A8130EC3F9F5F923
         gpg: BAD signature from "MongoDB VS Code Signing Key <vscode@mongodb.com>" [unknown]
