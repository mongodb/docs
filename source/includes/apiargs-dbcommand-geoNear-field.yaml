  The point for which to find the closest documents.

  If using a :doc:`2dsphere </core/2dsphere>` index, you can specify
  the point as either a GeoJSON point or legacy coordinate pair.

  If using a :doc:`2d </core/2d>` index, specify the point as a legacy
  coordinate pair.

- GeoJSON point

  Determines how MongoDB calculates the distance between two points: 
  
  - When ``true``, MongoDB uses :query:`$nearSphere` semantics and
    calculates distances using spherical geometry.
  
  - When ``false``, MongoDB uses :query:`$near` semantics:
    spherical geometry for :doc:`2dsphere </core/2dsphere>`
    indexes and planar geometry for :doc:`2d </core/2d>` indexes.

  *Default: false.*

  The maximum number of documents to return. The default value is ``100``.
  See also the ``num`` option.
interface: command
name: limit
operation: geoNear
optional: true
position: 4
type: number

arg_name: field
description: |
  The ``num`` option provides the same function as the ``limit`` option.
  Both define the maximum number of documents to return. If both options
  are included, the ``num`` value overrides the ``limit`` value.

name: num
operation: geoNear
optional: true
position: 5
type: number

arg_name: field
description: |
  The minimum distance from the center point that the documents *must*
  be. MongoDB filters the results to those documents that are *at
  least* the specified distance from the center point.

  Specify the distance in meters if the specified point is
  :term:`GeoJSON` and in radians if the specified point is
  :term:`legacy coordinate pairs <legacy coordinate pairs>`.

  The maximum distance from the center point that the documents *can*
  be. MongoDB limits the results to those documents that fall within
  the specified distance from the center point.

  Specify the distance in meters if the specified point is
  :term:`GeoJSON` and in radians if the specified point is
  :term:`legacy coordinate pairs <legacy coordinate pairs>`.

  Limits the results to the documents that match the query. The query
  syntax is the usual MongoDB :ref:`read operation query
  <read-operations-query-argument>` syntax.

  The factor to multiply all distances returned by the query. For
  example, use the ``distanceMultiplier`` to convert radians, as
  returned by a spherical query, to kilometers by multiplying by the
  radius of the Earth.
interface: command
name: distanceMultiplier
operation: geoNear
optional: true
position: 9
type: number

arg_name: field

  If this is ``true``, the query
  returns the location of the matching documents in the results. The
  default is ``false``. This option is useful when a location field
  contains multiple locations. To specify a field within an
  embedded document, use :term:`dot notation`.
interface: command
name: includeLocs
operation: geoNear
optional: true
position: 10
type: boolean

  If this value is ``true``, the query returns a matching document once,
  even if more than one of the document's location fields match the
  query.

  Specify the geospatial index to use when calculating the distance.
  If your collection has multiple geospatial indexes, you **must**
  use the ``key`` option to specify the indexed field path to use.
  {{example}} provides a full example.
  
  If you do not specify the field over which to perform the search with
  ``key``, MongoDB will attempt to look for a usable ``2d`` or
  ``2dsphere`` index, in that order. If there is more than one ``2d``
  index or more than one ``2dsphere`` index, MongoDB will return an
  error.
