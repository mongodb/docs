  To install all MongoDB binaries, including MongoDB Compass, to the
  default installation directory, go to the directory containing the
  ``.msi`` installation binary and invoke:

  .. include:: {{release_specification_default}}

  To specify a different installation location for the executables, 
  add the ``INSTALLLOCATION`` value.

  .. include:: {{release_specification_addlocation}}

  By default, this method installs all MongoDB binaries. To install 
  specific MongoDB component sets, you can specify them in the 
  ``ADDLOCAL`` argument using a comma-separated list including one or 
  more of the following component sets:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 20 80

     * - Component Set
       - Binaries
     * - ``Server``
       - ``mongod.exe``
     * - ``ServerService``
       - Set up ``mongod.exe`` as a service.
         Use in conjunction with ``Server`` to install and set up MongoDB as a service.
     * - ``Router``
       - ``mongos.exe``
     * - ``Client``
       - ``mongo.exe``
     * - ``MonitoringTools``
       - ``mongostat.exe``, ``mongotop.exe``
     * - ``ImportExportTools``
       - ``mongodump.exe``, ``mongorestore.exe``, ``mongoexport.exe``, ``mongoimport.exe``
     * - ``MiscellaneousTools``
       - ``bsondump.exe``, ``mongofiles.exe``

  To install just the MongoDB server and set up as a service and the
  ``mongo.exe`` shell, invoke:

  .. include:: {{release_specification_service}}

  To install *only* the MongoDB utilities, invoke:

  .. include:: {{release_specification_addlocal}}

  If you do *not* wish to install 
  :ref:`MongoDB Compass <compass-index>`
  at this time, include the ``SHOULD_INSTALL_COMPASS="0"`` argument.

  .. include:: {{release_specification_nocompass}}
