Documents are individual records in a MongoDB collection and are the 
basic unit of data in MongoDB.

You can use a MongoDB Playground to perform CRUD (create, read, update,
and delete) operations on documents in a collection on a 
:doc:`connected deployment </connect>`.

Use the :manual:`MongoDB CRUD Operators </crud>` and 
:manual:`shell methods </reference/method>` to interact with your 
databases in MongoDB Playgrounds.

.. note::

   You can also use your application to perform CRUD operations on 
   documents using the appropriate :driver:`driver </>`. Playgrounds are
   meant to help you prototype database operations as you develop your 
   application.
