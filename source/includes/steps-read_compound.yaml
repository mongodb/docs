title: Write an Implied AND Query

  There are two ways to write compound queries with AND as the logical operator in MongoDB. The first,
  and most popular way to do this is to simply list multiple fields in your JSON find document. The second
  is to use the ``$and`` operator. While both are valid, the implied method is more common, and so
  that's what you will use for this example.
  
  The following example retrieves all documents in the ``inventory``
  collection where the ``status`` equals ``"A"`` **and** ``qty`` is less
  than (:query:`$lt`) ``30``:

  If you have loaded data into your test database, you will see one or
  more JSON documents returned. Your results should look something like
  the JSON below. Note that the record below has a ``status`` of ``"A"``
  and a ``qty`` less than ``30`` per the criteria in the compound query.

title: Write an $or Query
ref: query-or

  Using the :query:`$or` operator, you can specify a compound query
  that joins each clause with a logical ``OR`` conjunction so that the
  query selects the documents in the collection that match at least one
  condition.
  
  The following example retrieves all documents in the collection where
  the ``status`` equals ``"A"`` **or** ``qty`` is less than
  (:query:`$lt`) ``30``:

  .. include:: /includes/driver-example-query-12.rst

  If you have loaded data into your test database, you will see one or
  more JSON documents returned. Note that the record has a ``status`` of ``"A"``
  but a ``qty`` of more than ``30``, which is acceptable according to
  the :query:`$or` criteria.
