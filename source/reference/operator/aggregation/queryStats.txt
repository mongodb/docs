.. pipeline:: $queryStats

.. include:: /includes/aggregation/queryStats/unsupported-warning.rst

.. include:: /includes/aggregation/queryStats/description.rst

``$queryStats`` collects and reports metrics for
:method:`~db.collection.aggregate()`, :method:`~db.collection.find()`,
and :method:`~db.collection.distinct()` queries. ``$queryStats`` does
not collect information for queries that use :ref:`{+qe+}
<qe-manual-feature-qe>`.

Requirements
------------

The ``$queryStats`` stage is enabled on deployments hosted on
:atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>` with a cluster tier of at least M10.

To run the ``$queryStats`` stage, your pipeline must meet the following
requirements:

- The pipeline must be run on the ``admin`` database.

- ``$queryStats`` must be the first stage in the pipeline.

Syntax
------

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( {
      aggregate: 1,
      pipeline: [
         {
            $queryStats: {
               transformIdentifiers: {
                  algorithm: <string>,
                  hmacKey: <binData> /* subtype 8 - used for sensitive data */
               }
            }
         }
      ],
      cursor: { }
    } )

.. important::

   You cannot run ``$queryStats`` on a specific collection. For complete
   examples, see :ref:`queryStats-examples`.

Command Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``$queryStats`` takes the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 10 10 20

   * - Field
     - Necessity
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``transformIdentifiers``
     - Optional
     - Document
     - Specifies additional transformation options for the
       ``$queryStats`` output.
   
   * - | ``transformIdentifiers``
       | ``.algorithm``
     - Required if specifying the ``transformIdentifiers`` object
     - String
     - The type of hash transformation applied to namespace information
       and field names in output. The only currently supported
       ``algorithm`` value is ``hmac-sha-256``.

   * - | ``transformIdentifiers``
       | ``.hmacKey``
     - Required if specifying the ``transformIdentifiers`` object
     - binData
     - The private key input in the HMAC transformation.

Access Control
--------------

If your deployment enforces access control, the user running
``$queryStats`` must have the following permissions:

- To run ``$queryStats`` without the ``transformIdentifiers`` option,
  the user must have the :authaction:`queryStatsRead` privilege action.

- To run ``$queryStats`` with the ``transformIdentifiers`` option, the
  user must have the both the :authaction:`queryStatsRead` and
  :authaction:`queryStatsReadTransformed` privilege actions.
 
The built-in :authrole:`clusterMonitor` role provides the
``queryStatsRead`` and ``queryStatsReadTransformed`` privileges. The
following example grants the ``clusterMonitor`` role on the ``admin``
database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.grantRolesToUser(
      "<user>",
      [ { role: "clusterMonitor", db: "admin" } ]
   )

Behavior 
--------

The following sections describe behavioral details of the
``$queryStats`` stage.

How $queryStats Tracks Query Statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Statistics for the ``$queryStats`` stage are tracked in a virtual
collection that is stored in-memory. The memory limit for the virtual
collection is 1% of the system's total memory.

How $queryStats Groups Returned Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``$queryStats`` groups queries with common properties into the same
output document. The resulting document is called a **query stats
entry**.

``$queryStats`` groups similar queries together by normalizing
user-provided field values to their data types. For example, a filter
specified as ``{ item: 'card' }`` is normalized to ``{ item :
'?string'}``. ``$queryStats`` also normalizes the values of some query
options like ``hint`` and ``comment``.

``$queryStats`` preserves literal values for options like
``readConcern`` and ``readPreference``.

For the complete list of options included in a query stats entry, see
:ref:`queryStats-find-query-shape`.

How $queryStats Transforms Data Using transformIdentifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an HMAC key is specified to the ``transformIdentifiers`` option,
``$queryStats`` uses the HMAC key to apply an HMAC-SHA-256 hash function
on the following data:

- Document field names

- Collection names

- Database names

``$queryStats`` **does not** apply the HMAC transformation to the
following data:

- MQL keywords such as operator names (for example, ``$gte``).

- Parameter names such as the ``partitionBy`` parameter in
  :pipeline:`$setWindowFields`.

- Field values. ``$queryStats`` normalizes field values in a query to
  their data types (such as number or string) when the query is
  recorded. ``$queryStats`` never stores field values that contain user
  data.

For an example of transformed output, see
:ref:`queryStats-example-transformed`.

$queryStats Log Entries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |queryStats| replace:: ``$queryStats``

.. include:: /includes/aggregation/queryStats/logging-intro.rst

To learn how to control ``$queryStats`` logging behavior, see
:ref:`queryStats-toggle-logging`.

.. _queryStats-change-stream-behavior:

Change Streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Query stats for :ref:`change streams <changeStreams>` are updated when
one of these events occur:

- A cursor is created
- A :dbcommand:`getMore` operation completes
- A cursor closes

Query stats reported for change streams have these behaviors:

- Execution metrics such as ``totalExecMicros`` contain information for
  the most recent operation (cursor creation, ``getMore``, or cursor close).

- Internal ``getMore`` operations increment the ``execCount`` metric.

- ``firstResponseExecMicros`` and ``totalExecMicros`` are always the
  same because stats are collected and updated for each ``getMore``
  operation.

- When the cursor closes, ``lastExecutionMicros`` is 0.

Output
------

``$queryStats`` returns an array of query stats entries. Some query
stats entry properties contain literal values, and some properties are
normalized to group common queries.

Query stats entries contain the following top-level documents:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20

   * - Document
     - Description

   * - ``key``
     - The unique combination of attributes that define an entry in the
       query stats output. The ``key`` contains attributes such as:

       - :ref:`Query shape <query-shapes>`
       - Client information
       - Read concern
       - :ref:`Collection type <queryStats-collectionType>`
       
       Each unique combination of attributes creates a separate
       entry in the ``$queryStats`` virtual collection.

   * - ``asOf``
     - The UTC time when ``$queryStats`` read this entry from the
       ``$queryStats`` virtual collection. ``asOf`` does not necessarily
       return the same UTC time for each result. Internally, the data
       structure is partitioned, and each partition will be read at an
       individual point in time.

   * - ``metrics``
     - Contains aggregated runtime metrics associated with each query
       stats entry. Each query stats entry records statistics for each
       query that shares the same key.

Each document in the output array contains the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

Supplemental Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Query stats entries may contain a ``metrics.supplementalMetrics`` document that
provides additional information about your queries. 

.. _queryStats-vectorSearch:

$vectorSearch Metrics
`````````````````````

If your query shape contains :pipeline:`$vectorSearch`, ``$queryStats``
outputs the following supplemental metrics:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 25 55

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - | ``metrics``
       | ``.supplementalMetrics``
       | ``.vectorSearch``
     - Document
     - Supplemental metrics about a ``$vectorSearch`` aggregation stage

   * - | ``metrics``
       | ``.supplementalMetrics``
       | ``.vectorSearch``
       | ``.limit``
     - Document
     - Metrics related to the ``limit`` value of the ``$vectorSearch`` aggregation stage

   * - | ``metrics``
       | ``.supplementalMetrics``
       | ``.vectorSearch``
       | ``.numCandidatesLimitRatio``
     - Document
     - Metrics related to the ``numCandidates`` value of the ``$vectorSearch``
       aggregation stage. ``$queryStats`` expresses these metrics as a ratio of
       ``numCandidates`` divided by the ``limit`` value.

     
.. _queryStats-examples:

Examples
--------

To run the examples in this section, start with the following data:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.insertMany(
     [
       { item: "card", qty: 15 },
       { item: "envelope", qty: 20 },
       { item: "stamps" , qty: 30 }
     ]
   )

Then, run these commands:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.find( { item: "card" } )

   db.products.aggregate( [
      {
         $match: { qty: { $gt: 20 } }
      }
   ] )


The following examples show the output of ``$queryStats`` using
different types of data transformation:

- :ref:`queryStats-example-untransformed`

- :ref:`queryStats-example-transformed`

The example ``$queryStats`` output in the following sections may vary
based on the execution of other commands.

MongoDB Atlas Data Collection
-----------------------------

MongoDB Atlas periodically uses ``$queryStats`` to collect anonymized
data about your queries, which helps improve MongoDB products. Your data
may also be used to make feature suggestions based on usage. MongoDB
retains the data it collects with ``$queryStats`` for four years.

When Atlas runs ``$queryStats`` on your deployment, it uses a unique
HMAC key per Atlas organization to transform your data and avoid
collecting sensitive information.
