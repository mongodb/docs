If you use any of the following |service| features, you might have to
add |service| IP addresses to your network's IP access list:

- :ref:`Alert Webhooks <third-party-integrations>`
- :ref:`security-kms-encryption`

  .. note:: 

     If you enable the :ref:`Encryption at Rest <scale-cluster-enable-encryption>`
     feature, you must allow access from public IPs for all your hosts
     in your deployment, including :ref:`CSRS (Config Server Replica
     Sets) <replset-config-servers>` if you are using :term:`sharded
     clusters <sharded cluster>`.

Fetch |service| Control Plane IP Addresses
-------------------------------------------

Send a GET request to the ``returnAllControlPlaneIPAddresses`` endpoint 
to fetch the current |service| control plane IP addresses. The :oas-atlas-op:`API endpoint </returnAllControlPlaneIPAddresses>` 
returns a list of inbound and outbound |service| control plane IP addresses in |cidr| notation 
categorized by cloud provider and region, similar to the following:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "controlPlane": {
       "inbound": {
         "aws": { // cloud provider
           "us-east-1": [ // region
             "3.92.113.229/32",
             "3.208.110.31/32",
             "107.22.44.69/32"
             ...,
           ],
           ...
          }
        },
        "outbound": {
          "aws": { // cloud provider
            "us-east-1": [ // region
              "3.92.113.229/32",
              "3.208.110.31/32",
              "107.22.44.69/32"
              ...,
            ],
            ...
           }
         }
     },
     "data_federation": {
       "inbound": {},
       "outbound" {}
     },
     "app_services": {
       "inbound": {},
       "outbound" {}
     },
     ...
   }

To add the returned IP addresses to your cloud provider's KMS IP access list, 
see the prerequisites for managing customer keys with :ref:`AWS <aws-ksm-prereqs>`, 
:ref:`Azure <azure-kms-prereqs>`, and :ref:`GCP <gcp-kms-prereqs>`.

Required Outbound Access
------------------------

.. note::

   The following IP addresses are subject to change. We recommend that you 
   :ref:`use the Atlas Admin API <atlas-fetch-control-plane-ips>` 
   to fetch the current inbound and outbound |service| control plane IP addresses.

If your network allows outbound HTTP requests only to specific IP
addresses, you must allow access to the following IP addresses so that
your API requests can reach the |service| control plane:

Required Inbound Access

.. note::

   The following IP addresses are subject to change. We recommend that you

   to fetch the current inbound and outbound |service| control plane IP addresses.

If your network allows inbound HTTP requests only from specific IP
addresses, you must allow access from the following IP addresses so that
|service| can communicate with your webhooks and |kms|:
