title: Generate your schema definition file.
ref: generate-schema
level: 4
pre: |
  Provide a MongoDB server hostname, replace ``dbname`` with the name of your
  database, and optionally replace ``collname`` with the name of a collection.
  If you do not specify a collection, :program:`mongodrdl` will generate a
  schema from all collections in ``dbname``.
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongodrdl --host example.com -d dbname [-c collname] -o schema.drdl
