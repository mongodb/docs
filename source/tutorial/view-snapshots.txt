Overview
--------

By default, |mms| takes a base snapshot of a backed-up deployment every 6
hours and retains snapshots as described in
:ref:`snapshot-frequency-and-retention`. Administrators can change the
frequency and retention settings.

You can view all available snapshots, as described here.

On-Demand Snapshots
-------------------

By default, |mms| takes on-demand snapshots with the same retention that you 
configured on the :ref:`snapshot settings <edit-snapshot-schedule>` for the 
daily snapshot. An on-demand snapshot doesn't alter the existing snapshot 
schedule. You can view on-demand snapshots on your :guilabel:`View All Snapshots` 
page.

.. note::

   When you add or remove a shard from your cluster, |mms| initiates an on-demand 
   snapshot.
