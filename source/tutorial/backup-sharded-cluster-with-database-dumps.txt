   Starting in MongoDB 3.2, the following procedure can be used with the
   :doc:`MMAPv1 </core/mmapv1>` and the :doc:`WiredTiger
   </core/wiredtiger>` storage engines. With previous versions of
   MongoDB, the procedure applied to :doc:`MMAPv1 </core/mmapv1>` only.

Overview
--------

This document describes a procedure for taking a backup of all
components of a :term:`sharded cluster`. This procedure
uses :binary:`~bin.mongodump` to create dumps of the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances. 

You may alternatively use :doc:`file system snapshots
</tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-filesystem-snapshots>` to capture
the backup data. File system snapshots may be more efficient in some
situations if your system configuration supports them.

For more information on backups in MongoDB and backups of sharded
clusters in particular, see :doc:`/core/backups` and
:doc:`/administration/backup-sharded-clusters`.

Access Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :authrole:`backup` role provides the required privileges to perform
backup on a sharded cluster that has access control enabled.

Consideration
-------------

To create backups of a sharded cluster, you will stop the
cluster balancer, take a backup of the :term:`config database`,
and then take backups of each shard in the cluster using
:binary:`~bin.mongodump` to capture the backup data. To capture a more
exact moment-in-time snapshot of the system, you will need to stop all
application writes before taking the filesystem snapshots; otherwise
the snapshot will only approximate a moment in time.

For approximate point-in-time snapshots, you can minimize the impact on
the cluster by taking the backup from a secondary member of each
replica set shard.
