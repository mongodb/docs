You add shards to a :term:`sharded cluster` after you create the cluster
or any time that you need to add capacity to the cluster. If you have not
created a sharded cluster, see :ref:`sharding-procedure-setup`.

In production environments, all shards should be :term:`replica sets
<replica set>`.

Capacity Planning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When adding a shard to a cluster, always ensure that the cluster has
enough capacity to support the migration required for balancing the
cluster without affecting legitimate production traffic.

Add a Shard to a Cluster
------------------------

You interact with a sharded cluster by connecting to a :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instance.

1. From a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, connect to the :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   instance. For example, if a :binary:`~bin.mongos` is accessible at
   ``mongos0.example.net`` on port ``27017``, issue the following
   command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mongo --host mongos0.example.net --port 27017

#. Add a shard to the cluster using the :method:`sh.addShard()`
   method, as shown in the examples below. Issue :method:`sh.addShard()`
   separately for each shard. If the shard is a replica set, specify the
   name of the replica set and specify a member of the set. In
   production deployments, all shards should be replica sets.

   .. note:: Optional
   
      You can instead use the :dbcommand:`addShard` database
      command, which lets you specify a name and maximum size for the
      shard. If you do not specify these, MongoDB automatically assigns
      a name and maximum size. To use the database command, see
      :dbcommand:`addShard`.

   The following are examples of adding a shard with
   :method:`sh.addShard()`:

   - To add a replica set shard named ``rs1`` with a member
     running on port ``27018`` on ``mongodb0.example.net``, issue the
     following command:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        sh.addShard( "rs1/mongodb0.example.net:27018" )

   - To add a standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod` shard running on port
     ``27018`` of ``mongodb0.example.net``, issue the following command:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        sh.addShard( "mongodb0.example.net:27018" )

   .. note:: It might take some time for :term:`chunks <chunk>` to
      migrate to the new shard.
