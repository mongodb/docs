      * - Read Preference
        - Selection Process

      * - :readmode:`primary` (Default)

        - #. The {{actor}} selects the primary.

      * - :readmode:`secondary`

        - #. The {{actor}} assembles a list of eligible secondary members.
             :ref:`maxStalenessSeconds

             sets </tutorial/configure-replica-set-tag-sets>` can further
             restrict the eligibility of the members.

          #. If the list of eligible members is not empty, the {{actor}}
             determines which eligible member is the "closest" (i.e. the
             member with the lowest average network round-trip-time) and
             calculates a latency window by adding the average
             round-trip-time of this "closest" server and the
             {{threshold}}. The  {{actor}} uses this latency window to
             pare down the list of eligible members to those members that
             fall within this window.

          #. From this list of eligible members that fall within the
             latency window, the  {{actor}} randomly chooses an eligible member.

      * - :readmode:`nearest`

        - #. The {{actor}} assembles a list of eligible members (primary and
             secondaries). :ref:`maxStalenessSeconds
             <replica-set-read-preference-max-staleness>` and :doc:`tag sets
             </tutorial/configure-replica-set-tag-sets>`
             can further limit the
             eligibility of the members.

          #. If the list of eligible members is not empty, the {{actor}}
             determines which eligible member is the "closest" (i.e. the
             member with the lowest average network round-trip-time) and
             calculates a latency window by adding the average
             round-trip-time of this "closest" server and the
             {{threshold}} [#default-threshold]_. The {{actor}} uses
             this latency window to pare down the list of eligible members
             to those members that fall within this window.

          #. From this list of eligible members that fall within the
             latency window, the {{actor}} randomly chooses an eligible member.


      * - :readmode:`primaryPreferred`

        - #. If the primary is available, {{actor}} selects the primary.

          #. Otherwise, server selection follows the process for the read
             preference ``secondary``.

      * - :readmode:`secondaryPreferred`

        - #. Following the server selection process for the read
             preference ``secondary``, if a list of eligible secondary
             members is non-empty, {{actor}} chooses an eligible secondary member.

          #. Otherwise, if the list is empty, {{actor}} selects the primary.
