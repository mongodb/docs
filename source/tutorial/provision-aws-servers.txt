=========================
Provision a Server on AWS
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MMS integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) so that you can provision EC2
servers directly from the MMS interface. When you provision an EC2 server
from MMS, MMS automatically installs the Automation Agent to the
server and is ready to deploy manged MongoDB instances on this
system.

Prerequisites
-------------

To provision EC2 servers through MMS, you must have an Amazon Web Services
account that meets the prerequisites described in :ref:`aws-checklist`.

You must also configure the MMS :guilabel:`AWS Settings` in MMS, as in
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-aws-settings`.

AWS Machine Size
----------------

In general, provision one machine per MongoDB instance. Make sure the
machines have sufficient capacity in terms of memory (RAM) and
storage. The root volume should have at least 25 gigabytes.

MMS does not allow selection of AWS instances smaller than the ``m1.large``
instance. MMS currently supports the AWS Linux and Ubuntu
operating systems.

   Next Steps
   ----------

   Once you have successfully deployed automation, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/manage-deployments-with-automation` to begin using
   Automation to manage MongoDB deployments.
