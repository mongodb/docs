=============================
Change the Version of MongoDB
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

For MongoDB deployments managed by |mms|, |mms| supports safe automatic upgrade and
downgrade operations between releases of MongoDB while maximizing the
availability of your deployment. |mms| supports upgrade and downgrade
operations for :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`,
:term:`replica sets <replica set>`, and :term:`standalone MongoDB
instances <standalone>`.

:doc:`/tutorial/configure-available-mongodb-version` describes how
to choose which versions of MongoDB are available to |mms|.

If your deployment is not managed by |mms|, you will need to manually
change the version of MongoDB. The MongoDB Manual provides upgrade
tutorials with each release. For example, see: :manual:`Upgrade MongoDB
to 3.0 </release-notes/3.0-upgrade>` for upgrading to MongoDB 3.0 from
an earlier version.
