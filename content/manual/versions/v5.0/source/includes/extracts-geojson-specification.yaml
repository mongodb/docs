   To specify GeoJSON data, use an embedded document with:

   - a field named ``type`` that specifies the GeoJSON object
     type, and

   - a field named ``coordinates`` that specifies the object's
     coordinates. 

   .. code-block:: javascript

      <field>: { type: <GeoJSON type> , coordinates: <coordinates> }

   MongoDB geospatial queries on GeoJSON objects calculate on a sphere;
   MongoDB uses the :term:`WGS84` reference system for geospatial
   queries on GeoJSON objects.

   For example, to specify a :ref:`GeoJSON Point <geojson-point>`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      location: {
            type: "Point",
            coordinates: [-73.856077, 40.848447]
      }

   examples, see :doc:`GeoJSON objects </reference/geojson>`.
