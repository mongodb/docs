When MongoDB returns text search results, it assigns a **score** to each
returned document. The score indicates the relevance of the document to
a given search query. You can sort returned documents by score to have
the most relevant documents appear first in the result set.

If you have a :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` with multiple
text index keys, you can specify different **weights** for each indexed
field. The weight of an indexed field indicates the significance of the
field relative to the other indexed fields, with higher weights
resulting in higher text search scores.

For example, you can emphasize search matches on a ``title`` field if
you know users are likely to search for titles, or if ``title`` contains
more relevant search terms compared to other document fields.

The default weight for indexed is 1 for the indexed fields. To adjust
the weights for the indexed fields, include the weights option in the
:method:`db.collection.createIndex()` method, as seen in this example:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 8-12

   db.<collection>.createIndex(
      {
        <field1>: "text",
        <field2>: "text",
        ...
      },
      {
        weights: {
          <field1>: <weight>,
          <field2>: <weight>,
          ...
        },
        name: <indexName>
      }
    )

.. important::

   If you change the weights in your index after it is created, MongoDB
   needs to reindex the collection. Reindexing can negatively impact
   performance, especially on large collections. For more information,
   see :ref:`index-creation-background`.

About this Task
---------------

You have a ``blog`` collection that contains documents for individual
blog posts. Each document contains:

- The content of the post.
- The topic that the post covers.
- A list of keywords related to the post.

You want to create a text index so users can perform text searches on
blog posts. Your application supports searches on content, topics, and
keywords.

You want to prioritize matches on the ``content`` field over other
document fields. Use index weights to assign greater importance to
matches on ``content`` and sort query results so ``content`` matches
appear first.

Before You Begin
----------------

.. include:: /includes/indexes/text-search-blog-example-documents.rst

Procedure
---------

Create a ``text`` index with different weights for each indexed field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.blog.createIndex(
      {
        content: "text",
        keywords: "text",
        about: "text"
      },
      {
        weights: {
          content: 10,
          keywords: 5
        },
        name: "BlogTextIndex"
      }
    )

The ``text`` index has the following fields and weights:

- ``content`` has a weight of 10.

- ``keywords`` has a weight of 5.

- ``about`` has the default weight of 1.

These weights indicate the relative significance of the indexed fields
to each other.

Results
-------

The following examples show how different weights for indexed fields
affect result scores. Each example sorts results based on the
``textScore`` of each document. To access documents' ``textScore``
attributes, use the :expression:`$meta` operator.

Matches in ``content`` and ``about`` Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following query searches documents in the ``blog`` collection for
the string ``ice cream``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.blog.find(
      {
         $text: { $search: "ice cream" }
      },
      {
         score: { $meta: "textScore" }
      }
   ).sort( { score: { $meta: "textScore" } } )

Output:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false
   
   [
     {
       _id: 2,
       content: 'Who likes chocolate ice cream for dessert?',
       about: 'food',
       keywords: [ 'food', 'poll' ],
       score: 12
     },
     {
       _id: 3,
       content: 'My favorite flavors are strawberry and coffee',
       about: 'ice cream',
       keywords: [ 'food', 'dessert' ],
       score: 1.5
     }
   ]

The search string ``ice cream`` matches:

- The ``content`` field in the document with ``_id: 2``.
- The ``about`` field in the document with ``_id: 3``.

A term match in the ``content`` field has ``10`` times the impact
(``10:1`` weight) as a term match in the ``keywords`` field.

Matches in ``keywords`` and ``about`` Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following query searches documents in the ``blog`` collection for
the string ``food``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.blog.find(
      {
         $text: { $search: "food" }
      },
      {
         score: { $meta: "textScore" }
      }
   ).sort( { score: { $meta: "textScore" } } )

Output:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   [
     {
       _id: 3,
       content: 'My favorite flavors are strawberry and coffee',
       about: 'ice cream',
       keywords: [ 'food', 'dessert' ],
       score: 5.5
     },
     {
       _id: 2,
       content: "Who likes chocolate ice cream for dessert?",
       about: 'food',
       keywords: [ 'poll' ],
       score: 1.1
     }
   ]

The search string ``food`` matches:

- The ``keywords`` field in the document with ``_id: 3``.
- The ``about`` field in the document with ``_id: 2``.

A term match in the ``keywords`` field has ``5`` times  the impact
(``5:1`` weight) as a term match in the ``about`` field.

Multiple Matches in a Single Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following query searches documents in the ``blog`` collection for
the string ``coffee``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.blog.find(
      {
         $text: { $search: "coffee" }
      },
      {
         score: { $meta: "textScore" }
      }
   ).sort( { score: { $meta: "textScore" } } )

Output:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   [
     {
       _id: 1,
       content: 'This morning I had a cup of coffee.',
       about: 'beverage',
       keywords: [ 'coffee' ],
       score: 11.666666666666666
     },
     {
       _id: 3,
       content: 'My favorite cake flavors are strawberry and coffee',
       about: 'ice cream',
       keywords: [ 'food', 'dessert' ],
       score: 6
     }
   ]

The search string ``coffee`` matches:

- The ``content`` and ``keywords`` fields in the document with ``_id:
  1``.

- The ``content`` field in the document with ``_id: 3``.

To calculate the ``score`` when a search string matches multiple fields,
MongoDB multiplies the number of matches by the weight for the
corresponding field and sums the results.

   For data hosted on MongoDB Atlas,
   :atlas:`Atlas Search </atlas-search>` provides more robust custom
   scoring than ``text`` indexes. To learn more, see the Atlas Search
