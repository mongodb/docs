Sync Changes in the Background
------------------------------

If you want your app to update data in the background (while the app is
minimized), iOS requires you to implement :apple:`Background App Refresh
<documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes/preparing_your_ui_to_run_in_the_background/updating_your_app_with_background_app_refresh>`.
Enabling Background App Refresh minimizes the time it takes for the user
to see the most recent data; without Background App Refresh, Realm
updates the data when the user launches the app, potentially resulting
in noticeable lag.

To use the realm while the device is locked, you must adjust the
file protection settings. See
:ref:`use-realm-when-the-device-is-locked`.

For an example of how to sync changes in the background using the 
SwiftUI ``BackgroundTask`` API, see: :ref:`Sync Data in the Background with 
SwiftUI <swiftui-background-sync>`.
