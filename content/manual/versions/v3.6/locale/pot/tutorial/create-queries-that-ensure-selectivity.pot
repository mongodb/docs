msgid "Selectivity is the ability of a query to narrow results using the index. Effective indexes are more selective and allow MongoDB to use the index for a larger portion of the work associated with fulfilling the query."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/create-queries-that-ensure-selectivity.txt:19
msgid "To ensure selectivity, write queries that limit the number of possible documents with the indexed field. Write queries that are appropriately selective relative to your indexed data."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/create-queries-that-ensure-selectivity.txt:26
msgid "Suppose you have a field called ``status`` where the possible values are ``new`` and ``processed``. If you add an index on ``status`` you've created a low-selectivity index. The index will be of little help in locating records."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/create-queries-that-ensure-selectivity.txt:31
msgid "A better strategy, depending on your queries, would be to create a :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` that includes the low-selectivity field and another field. For example, you could create a compound index on ``status`` and ``created_at.``"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/create-queries-that-ensure-selectivity.txt:36
msgid "Another option, again depending on your use case, might be to use separate collections, one for each status."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/create-queries-that-ensure-selectivity.txt:41
msgid "Consider an index ``{ a : 1 }`` (i.e. an index on the key ``a`` sorted in ascending order) on a collection where ``a`` has three values evenly distributed across the collection:"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/create-queries-that-ensure-selectivity.txt:57
msgid "If you query for ``{ a: 2, b: \"no\" }`` MongoDB must scan 3 :term:`documents <document>` in the collection to return the one matching result. Similarly, a query for ``{ a: { $gt: 1}, b: \"tv\" }`` must scan 6 documents, also to return one result."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/create-queries-that-ensure-selectivity.txt:62
msgid "Consider the same index on a collection where ``a`` has *nine* values evenly distributed across the collection:"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/create-queries-that-ensure-selectivity.txt:77
msgid "If you query for ``{ a: 2, b: \"cd\" }``, MongoDB must scan only one document to fulfill the query. The index and query are more selective because the values of ``a`` are evenly distributed *and* the query can select a specific document using the index."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/create-queries-that-ensure-selectivity.txt:82
msgid "However, although the index on ``a`` is more selective, a query such as ``{ a: { $gt: 5 }, b: \"tv\" }`` would still need to scan 4 documents."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/create-queries-that-ensure-selectivity.txt:88
msgid "If overall selectivity is low, and if MongoDB must read a number of documents to return results, then some queries may perform faster without indexes. To determine performance, see :ref:`indexes-measuring-use`."
