:ref:`mongosync <c2c-mongosync>` maintains a running log of events, 
including entries such as the copying collections and indexes, change stream 
events, and API calls.

Destination
-----------

``mongosync`` can write log messages to stdout or 
to file.

Standard Output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, ``mongosync`` outputs log messages to stdout:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/reference/logging/1.sh
   :language: shell

Example output:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/reference/logging/2.json
   :language: json
   :copyable: false

Log to File
^^^^^^^^^^^

To output log messages to file, start ``mongosync`` with the 
:option:`--logPath` option or set the :setting:`logPath` setting
in the configuration file.

When logging to file, ``mongosync`` writes logs to a file in the configured
directory.  The directory is created if it does not exist.  If a ``mongosync.log``
file already exists in the directory, ``mongosync`` rotates the log files to
preserve the old logs as it begins a new file.

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/reference/logging/3.sh
   :language: shell

For example: 

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/reference/logging/4.txt
   :language: text
   :copyable: false

The currently active log file is ``mongosync.log``.  The other files are older
logs that ``mongosync`` has rotated.

Verbosity
---------

``mongosync`` supports user-defined verbosity to 
increase or decrease the level of log messages ``mongosync`` outputs.

The verbosity level can be set using the :option:`--verbosity` option from the
command-line or the :setting:`verbosity` setting in the configuration file.

Format
------

``mongosync`` outputs log messages in structured 
JSON format. Each log message is a document that holds the key-value pairs for 
that entry. The keys label the log message elements, the values are the 
reported events.

For example:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/reference/logging/5.json
   :language: json
   :copyable: false

Examples
--------

To view log messages, check the ``mongosync.log`` file in the log directory.
You can format the log by piping its contents to ``jq`` or a similar command:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/reference/logging/6.sh
   :language: shell

Example output:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/reference/logging/7.json
   :language: json
   :copyable: false
