This page describes the conditions for which you can trigger alerts. 
You specify conditions and thresholds when :doc:`configuring alerts 
</configure-alerts>`. To learn more, see :ref:`alerts-workflow`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-free-shared-alerts.rst

Host Alerts
-----------

The conditions in this section apply if you select :guilabel:`Host` as
the alert target when configuring the alert. You can apply the
condition to all hosts or to specific type of host, such as
:term:`primaries <primary>` or
:term:`config servers <config server>`.

.. important::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-live-migration-host-alerts.rst

{+service+} triggers certain host alerts based on {+cluster+}
monitoring, and are thus subject to variations in granularity. To
learn more, see :ref:`Monitoring Data Storage Granularity
<monitoring-storage-granularity>`.

Advisor
~~~~~~~

.. alert:: Host has index suggestions

   Raised if :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>`
   has index suggestions for the host.

   If the :ref:`query targeting ratio <query-targeting-resolution>` for
   a host is greater than 8000 and if Performance Advisor determines
   that the host benefits from one or more indexes to improve
   performance of inefficient queries, this alert triggers and directs
   you to create the suggested indexes. 

   This alert is only available for ``M10+`` clusters, and is enabled
   by default for ``M10+`` clusters that have
   :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>` enabled. This alert
   does not trigger for clusters where Performance Advisor is disabled.

Asserts
~~~~~~~

The following alert conditions measure the rate of asserts for a
MongoDB process, as collected from the MongoDB ``serverStatus``
command's :serverstatus:`asserts` document. You can view asserts
through :doc:`cluster monitoring </monitor-cluster-metrics>`.

.. alert:: Asserts: Msg is

   Raised if the rate of message asserts meets the specified
   threshold. Message asserts are internal server errors. Stack traces
   are logged for these.

.. alert:: Asserts: Regular is

   Raised if the rate of regular asserts meets the specified
   threshold.

.. alert:: Asserts: User is

   Raised if the rate of errors generated by users meets the
   specified threshold.

.. alert:: Asserts: Warning is

   Raised if the rate of warnings meets the specified
   threshold.

.. _alert-conditions-autoscaling:

~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure alerts for the following {+cluster+} events.
:ref:`View the activity feed <view-activity-feed>` to review all
auto-scaling events that occurred.

For each event in this section, to receive alerts, you must first configure
an alert to notify you or members of your organization of this type of
an auto-scaling event.

   Raised if |service| couldn't start compute auto-scaling for any of the
   :term:`operational nodes <operational node>` in your dedicated {+cluster+}

   Raised if |service| couldn't start compute auto-scaling for any of the
   :term:`analytics nodes <analytics node>` in your dedicated {+cluster+}
   as the configured storage size isn't supported by the target {+cluster+} tier.

.. alert:: Auto-scaling: Compute auto-scaling didn't initiate for base tier due to maximum configured cluster tier

   Raised if |service| couldn't scale up an :term:`operational node <operational node>`
   because your {+cluster+} reached a maximum {+cluster+} tier configured for auto-scaling.

.. alert:: Auto-scaling: Compute auto-scaling didn't initiate for analytics tier due to maximum configured cluster tier

   Raised if |service| couldn't scale up an :term:`analytics node <analytics node>`

   for auto-scaling.

.. alert:: Auto-scaling: Compute auto-scaling didn't initiate for base tier due to insufficient oplog size

   Raised if |service| couldn't scale up an :term:`operational node <operational node>`

   *Applicable when the EC2 cluster credit balance is exhausted.*

   The percentage by which the CPU usage exceeds the guaranteed
   baseline CPU credit accumulation rate. CPU credits are units of CPU
   utilization that you accumulate. The credits accumulate at a
   constant rate to provide a guaranteed level of performance. These
   credits can be used for additional CPU performance. When the credit
   balance is exhausted, only the guaranteed baseline of CPU
   performance is provided, and the amount of excess is shown as steal
   percent.

   .. note::

      |service| triggers this alert only for AWS EC2 clusters that
      support :aws:`Burstable Performance </AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html>`.
      Currently, these are ``M10`` and ``M20`` cluster types.

Restarts
~~~~~~~~

.. alert:: Restarts in Last Hour is

   Raised if the number of times a host restarts within the
   previous hour exceeds the specified threshold.

Host Down
~~~~~~~~~

.. alert:: Host is Down
   
   Raised if |service| is unable to reach a host for several
   minutes.

   .. important::

      You should only configure this alert if you depend on secondary
      reads. For more information on secondary reads, see
      :ref:`replica-set-tags` and :ref:`replica-set-read-preference`.

   This alert is generally triggered by one of the following
   conditions:

   - The cluster has experienced a failure and is being auto-healed.
   - The cluster could not be reached because of a network issue.

   |service-fullname| checks that the downtime did not occur because of
   your actions, such as :manual:`rolling index builds
   </tutorial/build-indexes-on-replica-sets/>`. If |service-fullname| confirms
   that the downtime was not intentional, |service-fullname| attempts to replace
   the affected node. If failures occur, |service| clusters maintain node
   availability for both reads and writes as long as a majority of nodes are
   running. To learn more, see :ref:`How does MongoDB Atlas deliver high
   availability? <high-availability>`.

.. _alert-conditions-push-based-log-export:
