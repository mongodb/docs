  This is particularly useful for a :binary:`~bin.mongos` if you have a client
  that creates a number of connections but allows them to timeout rather
  than close the connections. When you set this option, ensure the value
  is slightly higher than the size of the connection pool or the total
  number of connections, to prevent erroneous connection spikes from
  propagating to the members of a sharded cluster.

     * - PLAIN

       - External authentication using LDAP. You can also use ``PLAIN``
         for authenticating in-database users. ``PLAIN`` transmits

  .. versionadded:: 2.4

  .. versionchanged:: 2.6 
     Starting in MongoDB 2.6, the default value for {{role}} is ``true``.

  When {{role}} is ``true``, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance saves all
  documents migrated from the shard to the ``moveChunk`` directory of
  the :setting:`storage.dbPath`. MongoDB does not delete data stored in
  ``moveChunk``.

description: |
  Enables or disables the automatic splitting of chunks for
  :term:`sharded collections <sharding>`. If {{role}} is ``false`` on
  all {{program}} instances, MongoDB does not create new chunks as the
  data in a collection grows. 
  
  Because any {{program}} in a cluster can create a split,
  to totally disable splitting in a cluster, you must set {{role}}
  to ``false`` on all {{program}}.

  .. warning::

     With auto-splitting disabled, the data in your sharded
     cluster may become imbalanced over time. Disable with caution.

  Do **not** disable data file preallocation in production systems. Only
  use this option for testing and with small data sets where you
  frequently drop databases.
