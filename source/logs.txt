|mdb-shell| uses `Newline delimited JSON
<https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec>`__ to store session logs.
Starting in :binary:`mongosh` version 1.0.5, the log |mdb-shell| format
is updated to match the MongoDB server log format. For details, see
:ref:`log-messages-ref`. 

You can view or tail the logs for a |mdb-shell| session based on its
log ID.
