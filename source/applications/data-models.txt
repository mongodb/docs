.. /tutorial/model-tree-structures.txt is just a composite page that
   includes all the tree structure pages for easy overview.

The following documents provide overviews of various data modeling
patterns and common schema design considerations:

:doc:`/applications/data-models-relationships`
   Examples for modeling relationships between documents.

   :doc:`/tutorial/model-embedded-one-to-one-relationships-between-documents`
      Presents a data model that uses :ref:`embedded documents
      <data-modeling-embedding>` to describe one-to-one relationships
      between connected data.

   :doc:`/tutorial/model-embedded-one-to-many-relationships-between-documents`
      Presents a data model that uses :ref:`embedded documents
      <data-modeling-embedding>` to describe one-to-many
      relationships between connected data.

   :doc:`/tutorial/model-referenced-one-to-many-relationships-between-documents`
      Presents a data model that uses :ref:`references
      <data-modeling-referencing>` to describe one-to-many
      relationships between documents.

:doc:`/applications/data-models-tree-structures`
   Examples for modeling tree structures.

   :doc:`/tutorial/model-tree-structures-with-parent-references`
      Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
      structure by storing :ref:`references
      <data-modeling-referencing>` to "parent" nodes in "child"
      nodes.

   :doc:`/tutorial/model-tree-structures-with-child-references`
      Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
      structure by storing :ref:`references
      <data-modeling-referencing>` to "child" nodes in "parent"
      nodes.

   See :doc:`/applications/data-models-tree-structures` for additional
   examples of data models for tree structures.

:doc:`/applications/data-models-applications`
   Examples for models for specific application contexts.

   :doc:`/tutorial/model-data-for-atomic-operations`
      Illustrates how embedding fields related to an atomic update
      within the same document ensures that the fields are in sync.

   :doc:`/tutorial/model-data-for-keyword-search`
      Describes one method for supporting keyword search by storing
      keywords in an array in the same document as the text field.
      Combined with a multi-key index, this pattern can support
      application's keyword search operations.
