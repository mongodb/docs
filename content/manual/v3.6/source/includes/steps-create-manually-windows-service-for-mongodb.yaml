title: "Create the database and log directories."
stepnum: 1
ref: create-directories
content: |
 
  If you have not created the data and log directories for your MongoDB
  server, you must create them before running MongoDB |edition| Edition
  as a Windows service.

  From the :guilabel:`Command Interpreter`, create the following directories:

  .. code-block:: bat

     cd C:\
     md "\data\db" "\data\log"

---
title: Create a MongoDB configuration file.
stepnum: 2
ref: create-configuration-file
content: |
  Create a MongoDB configuration
  file:

  .. code-block:: none

     C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\mongod.cfg

  .. note::
     MongoDB configuration files use the
     `YAML <http://yaml.org>`__ file format. Per the `YAML 1.2
     specification <http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2777534>`__,
     all indents must use spaces to maintain portability. To ensure no
     parsing errors, enclose all values in double quotation marks
     (``"``) and escape any backslash characters (``\``).

  Set the :setting:`storage.dbPath` and :setting:`systemLog.path`. Include additional
  :doc:`configuration options </reference/configuration-options>` as
  needed:

  .. code-block:: yaml

     systemLog:
       destination: "file"
       path: "c:\\data\\log\\mongod.log"
     storage:
       dbPath: "c:\\data\\db"

title: Create the MongoDB service.
stepnum: 3
ref: create-mongodb-service
content: |

  Invoke the following command in the :guilabel:`Command Interpreter` 
  to create the service:  
  
  .. code-block:: bat

      sc.exe create MongoDB binPath= "\"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\bin\mongod.exe\" ^
        --service --config=\"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\mongod.cfg\"" DisplayName= "MongoDB" start= auto

  .. note::
      ``sc.exe`` requires a space between "``=`` " and the 
      configuration values (i.e. ``binPath= `` ) as well as using
      `` "\"`` and ``\""`` to escape a double-quoted string.
  
  If successfully created, the following message is written to the 
  log:
  
  .. code-block:: bat
     :copyable: false

      [SC] CreateService SUCCESS

  Check your MongoDB log file for the following line:

  You may see non-critical warnings in the process
  output. As long as you see this message in the MongoDB log, you can 
  safely ignore these warnings during your initial evaluation of 
  MongoDB.

title: Connect to the MongoDB server.
stepnum: 6
ref: connect
content: |
  To connect to MongoDB through the :binary:`mongo.exe <bin.mongo>`
  shell, open another :guilabel:`Command Interpreter`.
  
  .. code-block:: bat

     "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\bin\mongo.exe"
