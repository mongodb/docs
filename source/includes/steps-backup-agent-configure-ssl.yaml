title: Configure the agent with the trusted CA certificate used to sign certificates of MongoDB instances.
stepnum: 1
ref: certificate
content: |
  In the agent's install directory, edit the ``local.config`` file and set
  the ``sslTrustedServerCertificates`` field to the path of a file
  containing one or more certificates in PEM format.

  By default, the agent connects to MongoDB instances using a trusted
  certificate. For testing purposes, you can set the
  ``sslRequireValidServerCertificates`` setting to ``False`` to bypass
  this check. This configuration is NOT recommended for production use as
  it makes the connection insecure.

  For reference information on both settings, see :ref:`backup-mongodb-ssl-settings`.
