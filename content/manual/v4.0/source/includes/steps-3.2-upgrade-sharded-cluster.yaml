title: Upgrade the shards.
level: 4
ref: 3.2-upgrade-shards
content: |
   Upgrade the shards one at a time. If the shards are replica sets,
   for each shard:

   a. Upgrade the :ref:`secondary <replica-set-secondary-members>`
      members of the replica set one at a time:

      - Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and replace the 3.0
        binary with the 3.2 binary.

      - Restart the member and wait for the member to recover to
        ``SECONDARY`` state before upgrading the next secondary member.
        To check the member's state, issue :method:`rs.status()` in the
        :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

   #. Step down the replica set primary.

      Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the primary and use
      :method:`rs.stepDown()` to step down the primary and force an
      election of a new primary:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         rs.stepDown()

   #. When :method:`rs.status()`
      shows that the primary has stepped down and another member
      has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, upgrade the stepped-down primary: 

      - Shut down the stepped-down primary and replace the
        :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary with the 3.2 binary.

      - Restart.

title: "Upgrade the config servers."
level: 4
ref: 3.2-upgrade-upgrade-config-servers
content: |  
  Upgrade the config servers one at a time in reverse order of the
  :setting:`~sharding.configDB` or :option:`--configdb <mongos --configdb>` setting for the
  :binary:`~bin.mongos`. That is, if the :binary:`~bin.mongos` has the
  following :option:`--configdb  <mongos --configdb>` listing:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongos --configdb confserver1:port1,confserver2:port2,confserver3:port2

  Upgrade first ``confserver3``, then ``confserver2``, and lastly
  ``confserver1``.

  Starting with the last config server listed in the
  :setting:`~sharding.configDB` setting:

  a. Stop the config server and replace with the 3.2 binary.

  #. Start the 3.2 binary with both the ``--configsvr`` and
     ``--port`` options:

     .. code-block:: sh

        mongod --configsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path>

     If using a :doc:`configuration file
     </reference/configuration-options>`, specify
     :setting:`sharding.clusterRole: configsvr <sharding.clusterRole>`
     and :setting:`net.port` in the file:

     .. code-block:: yaml

        sharding:
           clusterRole: configsvr
        net:
           port: <port>
        storage:
           dbpath: <path>

  Repeat for the config server listed *second* in the
  :setting:`~sharding.configDB` setting, and finally the config server
  listed *first* in the :setting:`~sharding.configDB` setting.
