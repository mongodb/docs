Use the {+atlas-cli+} to work with |service|, including using |fts| 
and {+avs+}, throughout the entire software development lifecycle from 
your local environment to the cloud.

With the ``atlas deployments`` commands, you can perform the following
actions:

- Create and manage local |service| deployments. Local |service| 
  deployments reside on your computer and provide a non-production 
  environment for development.
- Create and manage |service| cloud deployments. Cloud |service| 
  deployments reside in the cloud for non-production and production use.
- Manage |fts| and {+avs+} indexes for your local and cloud |service| 
  deployments.

.. note::

   For local |service| deployments, you can manage only deployments that
   you created with the ``atlas deployments`` command. If you created a 
   local |service| deployment without using the {+atlas-cli+}, you can't
   manage that deployment with the {+atlas-cli+}.

You can use only ``atlas deployments`` {+atlas-cli+} commands with 
local |service| deployments. You can use all {+atlas-cli+} 
commands, including ``atlas deployments`` commands,  with cloud 
|service| deployments.

Supported Actions
-----------------

You can perform the following actions with the ``atlas deployments`` 
command  for local and cloud |service| deployments including, but not limited to:

- :ref:`Set up a new Atlas deployment 
  <atlas-cli-deploy-local-setup>`.
   
- :ref:`List Atlas deployments <atlas-cli-deploy-local-manage>`.
  
- :ref:`Connect <atlas-cli-deploy-local-manage>` with {+mongosh+} or 
  :compass:`Compass </>`, or return the 
  connection string for an |service| deployment.

- :ref:`Pause or start an Atlas deployment 
  <atlas-cli-deploy-local-manage>`.
  
- :ref:`Delete an Atlas deployment <atlas-cli-deploy-local-manage>`.
  
- :ref:`Create or manage Atlas Search indexes 
  <atlas-cli-deploy-fts>` to run a full-text search on an 
  |service| deployment.
 
- :ref:`Create or manage {+avs+} indexes <atlas-cli-deploy-local-avs>` 
  to run a semantic search on an |service| deployment.

   * - :ref:`atlas-cli-deploy-local`
     - Use the ``atlas deployments`` command to create a local |service|
       deployment. This tutorial deploys a single-node replica set on
       your local computer.

   * - :ref:`atlas-cli-deploy-docker`
     - Use the ``atlas deployments`` command to create a local |service|
       deployment with Docker.

   * - :ref:`atlas-cli-deploy-fts`
     - Use the ``atlas deployments search indexes create`` command to 
       manage |fts| indexes and work with {+avs+} locally and in the 
       cloud.
