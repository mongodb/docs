All Flutter SDK objects are **live objects**, which means they
automatically update whenever they're modified. The SDK emits a
notification event whenever any property changes.

When a user adds a new item to a list, you may want to update the UI, show a
notification, or log a message. When someone updates that item, you may want to
change its visual state or fire off a network request. Finally, when someone
deletes the item, you probably want to remove it from the
UI. The SDK's notification system allows you to watch for and react to changes
in your data, independent of the writes that caused the changes.

You can subscribe to changes on the following events:

- :ref:`Query on collection <flutter-query-change-listener>`
- :ref:`Realm object <flutter-realm-object-change-listener>`
- :ref:`Collections in a Realm object <flutter-realm-list-change-listener>`
- :ref:`User instance <flutter-user-change-listener>`

About the Examples on This Page
-------------------------------

The examples in this page use two object types, ``Character`` and
``Fellowship``:

Additionally, the examples have this sample data:
