   :description: Configure Oracle database prerequisites for migration with Relational Migrator, including setting user permissions and enabling archive and supplemental logging.

When you migrate data from an Oracle source database, Relational Migrator 
automatically checks your database for needed configuration changes and 
generates a SQL script to implement them. Have a Database Administrator (DBA)
review the script and run the commands on the database server.

Oracle configuration depends on the type of migration job:

.. include:: /includes/fact-short-sync-job-desc.rst

For details on supported versions of Oracle, see 
:ref:`supported-databases`.

About this Task
---------------

- If you're migrating from an Oracle 12c instance, you must run commands as 
  the SYSDBA role.
- Oracle 12c introduced the concept of a pluggable database (PDB). Some
  commands can be run on a PDB, while commands like enabling ``ARCHIVELOG``
  must be run on the container/master database (CDB). For details on each
  architecture, see `Overview of Container Databases and Pluggable Databases <https://oracle-base.com/articles/12c/multitenant-overview-container-database-cdb-12cr1>`__.
- Some commands differ based on whether the database is single or
  multi-tenant. In a multi-tenant database, permissions must
  include the suffix ``CONTAINER=ALL``.
- You can't run a continuous migration job against Oracle Database Express 
  Edition (XE), because XE doesn't support the necessary logs.

Steps
-----

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Snapshot Jobs
      :tabid: enable-snapshot-jobs

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Set up user permissions

            .. include:: /includes/fact-data-prep-oracle-step1.rst

   .. tab:: Continuous Jobs
      :tabid: enable-continuous-jobs

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Set up user permissions

            .. include:: /includes/fact-data-prep-oracle-step1.rst

            d. Grant additional permissions to the service account 
               to run continuous migration jobs. 
               
               Append ``CONTAINER=ALL`` if you're migrating a multi-tenant container database.

               .. code-block:: sql
                  :copyable: true

                  GRANT SET CONTAINER TO <user>;
                  GRANT EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ANY TRANSACTION TO <user>;
                  GRANT LOGMINING TO <user>;
                  GRANT CREATE TABLE TO <user>;
                  GRANT LOCK ANY TABLE TO <user>;
                  GRANT CREATE SEQUENCE TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON DBA_TABLESPACES TO <user>; 
                  GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_LOGMNR TO <user>;
                  GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_LOGMNR_D TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON V_$LOG TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON V_$LOG_HISTORY TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON V_$LOGMNR_LOGS TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON V_$LOGMNR_CONTENTS TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON V_$LOGMNR_PARAMETERS TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON V_$LOGFILE TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON V_$ARCHIVED_LOG TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON V_$ARCHIVE_DEST_STATUS TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON V_$TRANSACTION TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON V_$MYSTAT TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON V_$STATNAME TO <user>; 

         .. step:: Turn on archive logging
            
            a. To see if archive logging is already enabled, run the following query:

               .. code-block:: sql
                  :copyable: true

                  SELECT LOG_MODE FROM V$DATABASE;

               This outputs ``ARCHIVELOG`` if logging is enabled, or
               ``NOARCHIVELOG`` if it isn't.
            
            #. If archive logging isn't already enabled,  enable it. 
            
               Relational Migrator can automatically generate code to enable
               logging. The following code is an example. If you're migrating a
               multi-tenant database, run these commands on the container/
               master database.

               .. code-block:: sql
                  :copyable: true

                  ALTER SYSTEM SET db_recovery_file_dest_size = 10G;
                  ALTER SYSTEM SET db_recovery_file_dest = '/opt/oracle/oradata/recovery_area' scope=spfile;
                  SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
                  STARTUP MOUNT
                  ALTER DATABASE ARCHIVELOG;
                  ALTER DATABASE OPEN;
    
         .. step:: Enable supplemental logging

            a. Enable supplemental logging on the database:

               .. code-block:: sql
                  :copyable: true

                  ALTER DATABASE ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA; 

            #. Enable supplemental logging for every table in the migration:

               .. code-block:: sql
                  :copyable: true

                  ALTER TABLE schemaName.tableName ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA (ALL) COLUMNS;
                  /* Additional ALTER TABLE STATEMENTS... */
