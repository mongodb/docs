|service| secures your databases through TLS/SSL, whitelists, and user
authentication and access control.

TLS/SSL
-------

|service| uses TLS/SSL to encrypt the connections to your databases.

.. _whitelist:
.. _add-to-whitelist:

Add IP Addresses to the Whitelist
---------------------------------

|service| allows client connections to the cluster only from IP
addresses on the group's whitelist; i.e. a client can connect to the
MongoDB deployment only from an IP address on this list. The whitelist
applies to all clusters in the group.

To add an IP address or an address range to the whitelist, from the
:guilabel:`Clusters` view, select the :guilabel:`Security` tab, then
click :guilabel:`IP Whitelist`, then :guilabel:`Add IP Address`.

.. include:: /includes/steps/add-to-whitelist.rst

To add more entries to the whitelist, repeat this procedure.

.. _mongodb-users:

Create a New MongoDB User for the Cluster
-----------------------------------------

Create MongoDB users to provide clients access to the clusters in your
group. A MongoDB user's access is determined by the roles assigned to
the user. 

To create a new MongoDB user, from the :guilabel:`Clusters` view,
select the :guilabel:`Security` tab, then click :guilabel:`Users`, then
:guilabel:`Add New User`.

MongoDB users are separate from |service| users. MongoDB users have
access to MongoDB databases, while |service| users access to the
|service| application itself.

.. note::

   When you create a MongoDB user, the user is added to all
   clusters in your |service| group.
