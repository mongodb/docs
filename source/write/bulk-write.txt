Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to perform multiple write operations
in a single database call by using **bulk write operations**.

Consider a scenario in which you want to insert a document into a collection,
update multiple other documents, then delete a document. If you use
individual methods, each operation requires its own database call. Instead,
you can use a bulk operation to reduce the number of calls to the database.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection in the ``sample_restaurants``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To access this collection
from your PHP application, instantiate a ``MongoDB\Client`` that connects to an Atlas cluster
and assign the following value to your ``$collection`` variable:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.php
    :language: php
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-db-coll
    :end-before: end-db-coll

To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

.. _php-bulk-operations:

Bulk Operations
---------------

To run a bulk write operation, pass an array of write operations to the
``MongoDB\Collection::bulkWrite()`` method. Use the following syntax to 
specify the write operations:

.. code-block:: php

   [
       [ 'deleteMany' => [ $filter ] ],
       [ 'deleteOne'  => [ $filter ] ],
       [ 'insertOne'  => [ $document ] ],
       [ 'replaceOne' => [ $filter, $replacement, $options ] ],
       [ 'updateMany' => [ $filter, $update, $options ] ],
       [ 'updateOne'  => [ $filter, $update, $options ] ],
   ]

.. tip::

    For more information about delete, insert, replace, and update
    operations, see the :ref:`Write operation guides <php-write>`.

When you call the ``bulkWrite()`` method, the library automatically runs the
write operations in the order they're specified in the array. To learn how to
instruct ``bulkWrite()`` to run the write operations in an arbitrary order,
see the :ref:`php-bulk-modify` section.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example runs the following write operations on the ``restaurants``
collection:

- **Insert operation** to insert a document in which the ``name`` value is 
  ``'Mongo's Deli'``

- **Update operation** to update the ``cuisine`` field of a document in
  which the ``name`` value is ``'Mongo's Deli'``

- **Delete operation** to delete all documents in which the ``borough`` value
  is ``'Manhattan'``

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.php
   :start-after: start-run-bulk
   :end-before: end-run-bulk
   :language: php
   :dedent:

.. _php-bulk-modify:

Modify Bulk Write Behavior
--------------------------

You can modify the behavior of the ``MongoDB\Collection::bulkWrite()`` method by
passing an array that specifies option values as a parameter. The following table 
describes the options you can set in the array:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Description

   * - ``bypassDocumentValidation``
     - | Specifies whether the operation bypasses document validation. This lets you 
         modify documents that don't meet the schema validation requirements, if any 
         exist. For more information about schema validation, see :manual:`Schema
         Validation </core/schema-validation/#schema-validation>` in the {+mdb-server+}
         manual.
       | Defaults to ``false``.

   * - ``codec``
     - | Sets the codec to use for encoding or decoding documents. Bulk writes 
         use the codec for ``insertOne()`` and ``replaceOne()`` operations.
         For more information, see the :ref:`php-codecs` guide.

   * - ``writeConcern``
     - | Sets the write concern for the operation.
         For more information, see :manual:`Write Concern </reference/write-concern/>`
         in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``let``
     - | Specifies a document with a list of values to improve operation readability.
         Values must be constant or closed expressions that don't reference document
         fields. For more information, see the :manual:`let statement
         </reference/command/update/#std-label-update-let-syntax>` in the
         {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``ordered``
     - | If set to ``true``: when a single write fails, the operation stops without
         performing the remaining writes and throws an exception.
       | If set to ``false``: when a single write fails, the operation continues to
         attempt the remaining write operations, if any, then throws an exception.
       | Defaults to ``true``.

   * - ``comment``
     - | Attaches a comment to the operation. For more information, see the :manual:`insert command
         fields </reference/command/insert/#command-fields>` guide in the
         {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``session``
     - | Specifies the client session to associate with the operation.

The following example calls the ``bulkWrite()`` method to perform an 
insert and delete operation and sets the ``ordered`` option to
``false``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.php
   :start-after: start-bulk-options
   :end-before: end-bulk-options
   :language: php
   :dedent:

If the library runs the insert operation first, one document is deleted.
If it runs the delete operation first, no documents are deleted. 

.. note::

   Unordered bulk operations do not guarantee order of execution. The order can
   differ from the way you list them to optimize the runtime.

.. _php-bulk-return-value:

Return Value
------------

The ``MongoDB\Collection::bulkWrite()`` method returns a ``MongoDB\BulkWriteResult``
object. This class contains the following member functions:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Function
     - Description
         
   * - ``getDeletedCount()``
     - | Returns the number of documents deleted, if any.

   * - ``getInsertedCount()``
     - | Returns the number of documents inserted, if any.

   * - ``getInsertedIds()``
     - | Returns a map of ``_id`` field values for inserted documents, if any.

   * - ``getMatchedCount()``
     - | Returns the number of documents matched during update and replace
         operations, if applicable.

   * - ``getModifiedCount()``
     - | Returns the number of documents modified, if any.

   * - ``getUpsertedCount()``
     - | Returns the number of documents upserted, if any.

   * - ``getUpsertedIds()``
     - | Returns a map of ``_id`` field values for upserted documents, if any.

   * - ``isAcknowledged()``
     - | Returns a boolean indicating whether the bulk operation was acknowledged.
