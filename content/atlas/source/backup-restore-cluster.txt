.. _backup-cluster:

Backups are copies of your data that encapsulate the state of your
cluster at a given time. Backups provide a safety measure in the
event of data loss. If you have strict data protection requirements, 
you can :ref:`enable a {+bcp+} <backup-compliance-policy>` to protect 
your backup data.

Considerations
--------------

Be aware that:

- |service| backups are not available for ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+}.
  You may use :ref:`mongodump <command-line-tools-mongodump>` to back
  up your ``M0`` cluster data and
  :ref:`mongorestore <command-line-tools-mongorestore>` to restore that
  data. To learn how to manually back up your data, see
  :doc:`Command Line Tools </command-line-tools>`.

- You can't write to your cluster while 
  a backup restore is in progress for that cluster.

- You can restore a backup only to a cluster running either:

  - The same major release version with an equal or higher minor
    version. For example, if you create a backup for a cluster running
    MongoDB 8.1.x, you can restore this backup to a cluster running
    any other 8.1.x version, or any 8.y.x version where ``y >
    1``, but you can't restore it to any 8.0.x version.

  - The next higher major release version. For example, if you create
    a backup for a cluster running MongoDB 8.y.x, you can restore this
    backup to a cluster running 9.y.x, but you can't restore it to any
    7.y.x version.

  If the backup has a pinned FCV, the major version of the target
  {+cluster+} must match the major version of that pinned FCV.

.. _cloud-backup-overview:

{+Cloud-Backup+}s
-----------------

*Available in M10+ {+Clusters+}.*

|service| backups are immutable by default. Therefore, it is not possible to modify a
snapshot. To enforce indelibility, you can enable a :ref:`Backup Compliance Policy
<configure-backup-policy>`, which prevents  **all**  users from deleting backups or
altering their retention settings, ensuring strict backup integrity.

|service| supports
:ref:`{+Cloud-Backup+}s <backup-cloud-provider>` on:

- :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>`
- :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>`
- :ref:`Google GCP <google-gcp>`

To learn more, see :ref:`backup-cloud-provider`.

To learn how to restore cluster from a {+Cloud-Backup+}, see
:ref:`restore-from-snapshot`.

Snapshots for {+Flex-Clusters+}
-------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/shared-to-atlas-flex-migration.rst

Backups are automatically enabled for {+Flex-clusters+} and can't be disabled.
|service| takes daily snapshots of your {+Flex-clusters+}, which you can
restore to {+Flex-cluster+} or ``M10`` and greater tiers.

To learn more about backing up your cluster, see :ref:`flex-snapshots`.

To learn more about restoring your cluster, see :ref:`restore-from-snapshot`.
