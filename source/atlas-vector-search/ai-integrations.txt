{+avs+} integrates with popular |llm|\s and frameworks through
their standard |api|\s. MongoDB and partners also provide 
specific product integrations to help you leverage {+avs+}
in your generative AI and AI-powered applications. 

This page highlights notable AI integrations 
that MongoDB and partners have developed. For a complete 
list of integrations and partner services, 
see :ref:`explore-ecosystem`.

Key Concepts
------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-ai-key-concepts.rst

Frameworks
----------

You can integrate {+avs+} with the following open-source |llm|
frameworks to store custom data in |service| and implement 
|rag| with {+avs+}.

LangChain
~~~~~~~~~

`LangChain <https://langchain.com/>`__ is a framework
designed to simplify the creation of |llm| applications
through the use of "chains," which are LangChain-specific
components that can be combined together for a variety of use 
cases, including |rag|.

To get started, see the following tutorials:

- :ref:`langchain`.
- :ref:`langchain-js`.

LlamaIndex
~~~~~~~~~~

`LlamaIndex <https://llamaindex.ai/>`__ is a framework designed to 
simplify how you connect custom data sources to |llm|\s. It provides
several tools to help you load and prepare vector embeddings for 
|rag| applications.

To get started, see :ref:`llamaindex`.

API Resources
-------------

Refer to the following |api| resources as you develop
with AI integrations for {+avs+}:

- `LangChain Python API Reference <https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/mongodb_api_reference.html>`__
- `LangChain JS/TS API Reference <https://api.js.langchain.com/modules/langchain_mongodb.html>`__
- `LlamaIndex API Reference <https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/api_reference/storage/vector_store/mongodb/>`__
