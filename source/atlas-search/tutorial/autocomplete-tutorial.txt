This tutorial describes how to create an |fts| index and run
autocomplete queries to return results for partial words. This is
useful to retrieve results with increasing accuracy as more characters
are entered in your application's search field. You can use the |fts|
:ref:`autocomplete-ref` operator to query field values that you index as
the |fts| :ref:`autocomplete <bson-data-types-autocomplete>` type.

Specifically, this tutorial demonstrates the following:

- How to set up an |fts| index with the :ref:`autocomplete
  <bson-data-types-autocomplete>` type for the ``sample_mflix.movies``
  collection.  

- How to run |fts| queries against the indexed fields in the
  ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection for a partial words.  

Before you begin, ensure that your |service| {+cluster+} meets the
requirements described in the :ref:`Prerequisites
<fts-tutorials-prereqs>`.

Define an Index with Autocomplete
---------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-autocomplete-field-type.rst

In this section, you create an |fts| index that indexes the ``title`` and 
``plot`` fields for autocompletion. The index definition performs the
following actions:  

- Creates indexable terms between ``2`` and ``15``
  characters long, starting from the left side of each word (``tokenization: edgeGram``). 
- Ignores diacritic marks such as accents or symbols in the index and
  query to return results with and without diacritic marks
  (``foldDiacritics: true``).  

.. |search-type| replace:: :guilabel:`Atlas Search`
.. |index-name| replace:: ``autocomplete-tutorial``
.. |database-name| replace:: ``sample_mflix`` database
.. |collection-name| replace:: ``movies`` collection
