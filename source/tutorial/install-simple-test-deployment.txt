Install a Simple Test |onprem| Installation
===========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. warning::

   This setup is not suitable for a production deployment.

To evaluate |onprem|, you can install the
:ref:`mms-application-package` and
:ref:`mms-application-database` on a single host. This setup provides
all the functionality of |onprem| monitoring and automation but
provides **no** failover or high availability.

Unlike a production installation, this test installation uses one
|mongod| for the |application| database. In production, the database
requires a dedicated :term:`replica set`.

This procedure explains how to activate the Backup feature. This
optional step requires you to install :ref:`backup-database` on the
same host as the other |onprem| components. You configure the backup
database as you would the application database, using one |mongod|
instead of a replica set.

To install and configure an evaluation version of |onprem| on hosts
running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.0:
