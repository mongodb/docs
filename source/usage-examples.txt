Overview
--------

Usage examples provide convenient starting points for popular MongoDB
operations. Each example provides the following information:

- A code snippet that shows how to perform the operation in synchronous and
  asynchronous frameworks

- A link to a fully runnable console application using the operation

- The expected result after running the example

How to Use the Usage Examples
-----------------------------

These examples use the :atlas:`sample datasets </sample-data>`
provided by Atlas. You can load them into your database on the free tier of
MongoDB Atlas by following the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas Guide </getting-started/#atlas-getting-started>`
or you can
:guides:`import the sample dataset into a local MongoDB instance
</server/import/>`.

Once you have imported the dataset, you can copy and paste a usage
example into your development environment of choice. You can follow the
:ref:`csharp-quickstart` to learn more about getting
started with the {+driver-long+}. Once you've copied a usage example,
you'll need to edit the connection URI to get the example connected to
your MongoDB instance:

.. code-block:: csharp

   // Replace the following with your MongoDB deployment's connection string.
   private static string _mongoConnectionString = "<connection string>";

For more information about connecting to your MongoDB instance, see the
:ref:`Connection Guide <csharp-connection>`.
