Synopsis
--------

:binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` is the build of the MongoDB daemon
(i.e. :binary:`~bin.mongod`) for the Windows
platform. :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` has all of the features of
:binary:`~bin.mongod` on Unix-like platforms and is completely compatible
with the other builds of :binary:`~bin.mongod`. In addition,
:binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` provides several options for interacting with
the Windows platform itself.

This document *only* references options that are unique to
:binary:`~bin.mongod.exe`. :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` supports all
:binary:`~bin.mongod` options *except* those with documented Windows
incompatibility. See the :doc:`/reference/program/mongod` and the
:doc:`/reference/configuration-options` documents for more information
on ``mongod`` options not listed here.

To install and use :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe`, read the
