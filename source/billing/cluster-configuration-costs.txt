Cloud Service Provider and Region
---------------------------------

|service| supports deploying clusters onto :ref:`Amazon Web Services
<amazon-aws>`, the :ref:`Google Cloud Platform <google-gcp>`, and
:ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>`. The choice of cloud service
provider and region or regions for the |service| project affects the
cost of running a |service| cluster.

Multi-region cluster costs depend on the number of and location of 
additional regions selected. When creating a cluster, |service|
displays the :ref:`cluster tier cost <instance-size-costs>` based on
only the :guilabel:`Preferred Region` of the cluster. You can see the
total cost of running the cluster in the :guilabel:`Cluster Overview`.

For more information on configuring your cloud provider and region, see :ref:`Cloud Providers and Regions <create-cluster-cloud-provider-region>`.

.. _instance-size-costs:

Cluster Tier
-------------

|service| provides different :ref:`cluster tiers <create-cluster-instance>`. Each cluster tier has a
default RAM capacity, storage capacity, and maximum storage speed. The 
cluster's per-hour charge includes these default values.
|service| uses the selected cluster when deploying all the
data-bearing [#data-bearing]_ servers in your cluster.

Depending on the choice of cloud service provider, |service| provides
customization options for :ref:`cluster storage capacity <storage-capacity>` and the :ref:`speed <instance-storage-speed>` of
that storage. If you add capacity or speed, you incur additional costs
on top of the base cost. For multi-region clusters, the per-cluster
cost, including any selected customizations, is relative to the
:guilabel:`Preferred Region`. The :guilabel:`Cluster Overview` box
shows your overall charges.

.. _storage-capacity:
.. _instance-storage-capacity:

Storage Capacity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| charges for :ref:`storage capacity <create-cluster-storage>`
differently depending on whether you use the cluster default or specify
a custom storage capacity. If you use the default, storage is included
in the cluster's per-hour cost. If you customize, |service| charges for
the entire amount of storage, not the difference from the default size.

For example, if the cluster default is 80 GB and if you increase
storage to 100 GB, the change in cost is the charge for 100 GB. If you
then increase storage to 120 GB, the change in cost is the charge for
20 GB.

.. note::

   Increasing storage capacity can change the max IOPS available
   with each :guilabel:`Custom Storage Speed`.

.. _storage-speed:
.. _instance-storage-speed:

Custom Storage Speed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| measures storage speed as maximum |iops|. Each |service|
:ref:`cluster tier<instance-size-costs>` offers a default storage
speed that is included in the cluster's per-hour cost. The choice of
cloud service provider and cluster affects the available storage
speed customization options, as well as the cost of selecting a custom
storage speed.

|aws|
  For most cluster types, you can increase storage speed from
  :guilabel:`Standard` to :guilabel:`Fast` or :guilabel:`Fastest`,
  which affects costs. Selecting a custom speed changes both |iops| and
  the type of storage used. The storage type changes from a
  general-purpose |ssd| to a provisioned-|iops| |ssd|. For more
  information on storage types, see
  `Amazon EBS Volume Types <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html>`_.

|gcp|
  All clusters use |ssd| persistent disks with fixed maximum |iops|
  based on the cluster storage capacity. The maximum |iops| increases
  as storage capacity increases. The cost of the increased maximum
  |iops| is included in the cost of the increased storage capacity. For
  more information on the |gcp| persistent disks, see
  `Persistent Disks <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/#pdspecs>`_.

:abbr:`Azure (Microsoft Azure)`
  All clusters use premium |ssd| disks with fixed maximum |iops| based
  on the storage capacity. The maximum |iops| increases as storage
  capacity increases. The cost of the increased maximum |iops| is
  included in the cost of the increased storage capacity. For more
  information on the Azure Premium disks, see
  `High-performance Premium Storage and managed disks for VMs <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-premium-storage>`_.

Cluster Auto-Scaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To help minimize cluster costs while retaining the flexibility to easily
scale your cluster, you can enable :ref:`Cluster Auto-Scaling
<cluster-autoscaling>`. With auto-scaling, your cluster automatically
scales its tier, storage capacity, or both in response to cluster usage.
Auto-scaling reduces the need to manually optimize your cluster to adapt to
your current workload.

Backup
------

The |service| :doc:`../backup-restore-cluster` supports
:doc:`/backup/continuous-backups` and
:doc:`/backup/cloud-provider-snapshots`. Each backup method has
its own cost calculations and considerations.

|service| charges for each replica set in a cluster. For a replica set
deployment, the backup costs are the cost to backup data for the
replica set. For a sharded cluster deployment, |service| sums the cost
to backup the data for each shard replica set *and* the config server
replica set.

|service| charges for the network transfer costs of restoring a
snapshot. See :ref:`data-transfer-costs` for more information on how
|service| charges for network data.

Continuous Backups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The backup cost for continuous backups is per GB per month
(US$2.50 / GB / month) as specified on the |service-pricing|_. The
monthly rate is annualized and then divided by 365 to arrive at a
Daily Backup Rate per GB. The first 1 GB of backup data is free.

Monthly backup costs are primarily based on the size per-gigabyte of
the data to back up. This size is roughly equivalent to the
uncompressed size of all documents and all indexes for all the
databases backed up.

To retrieve the size in gigabyte of the documents and indexes for a
given database, you can issue the
:manual:`db.stats() </reference/method/db.stats>` method and sum the
``dataSize`` and ``indexSize`` fields.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.stats(1024*1024*1024).dataSize + db.stats(1024*1024*1024).indexSize

The rate is based on your having 28 snapshots at steady state:

- The six-hour snapshots are kept for two days;

- The daily snapshots for one week,

- The weekly snapshots for one month,

- The monthly for one year.

Adding that up, you get 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 snapshots. We adjust the
backup rate daily based on the following formula:

.. code-block:: none

   backupRatePerMonth = $1.25 + snapshotAtSteadyState/28 * $1.25

Changing the snapshot frequency or retention period affects the base
rate per GB. See :ref:`modify-backup-schedule` for more information.

.. admonition:: Examples

   - For a three-member replica set with 30GB of data, |service|
     charges US$72.50 each month (using the default backup rate).

     ``(30GB - 1GB) × US$2.50 = US$72.50``

   - A sharded cluster with 3 shards contains 90GB of data, with each
     shard containing 30GB of data each. The config server replica set
     contains 5GB of data.

     For this sharded cluster, |service| charges US$227.50 per month
     (using the default backup rate).

     ``((30GB - 1GB) × US$2.50) × 3) + ((5GB - 1GB) × US$2.50) =
     US$227.50``

Cloud Provider Snapshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-cloud-providers::

     tabs:

     - id: azure
       content: |

         The backup cost for cloud provider snapshots is the *total*
         size of all snapshots per GB per month. The rate per GB
         depends on the region of the cluster. For multi-region
         clusters, the rate per GB depends on the cluster's preferred
         region.

         .. example::

            For a three member replica set deployed to the Azure
            ``useast2`` region (Virginia, USA) with three snapshots of
            10, 20, and 30GB respectively, |service| charges US$20.40.

            ``(10GB * US$0.34) + (20GB * US$0.34) + (30GB * US$0.34)``

            .. note::

               The US$0.34 rate per GB is specific to the
               :ref:`Azure <microsoft-azure>` ``useast2`` region at the
               time of writing. |service| displays the most current
               cost per GB for the cluster's selected region during
               cluster configuration.
               See :doc:`/tutorial/create-new-cluster` or :doc:`/scale-cluster`
               for more information on cluster configuration.

         When restoring a cluster using a manual download via HTTPS,
         |service| also charges per-hour that the download link remains
         active. Contact MongoDB Support for more information.
         From the |service| project or cluster view, click
         :guilabel:`Support` in the left-hand navigation bar.

         .. note::

            Backup snapshots which are :ref:`KMS encrypted
            <security-kms-encryption>` are not downloadable.

         .. include:: /includes/cps-sizing-support.rst
         
         Point-in-Time Restores
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         
         Cluster owners may opt to enable :ref:`Point-in-Time
         restores <pit-restore>` from cloud provider snapshots.
         :abbr:`PIT (Point-in-Time)` backups are billed based on the disk
         space occupied by the cluster's :term:`oplog` combined with the
         :abbr:`CPS (Cloud Provider Snapshot)` backup size. Total cost is
         calculated based on tiered pricing, which varies by region.

         Pricing by region is as follows:

         GB depends on the region of the cluster. For multi-region
         clusters, the snapshot storage location depends on the
         location of the replica set member targeted for snapshots.
         The rate per GB therefore depends on the region of the
         targeted replica set member at the time of the snapshot.

         |aws| Cloud Provider Snapshots
         supports incremental snapshots, where a new snapshot saves
         only the data that changed after your most recent snapshot.
         For example, a cluster with ``10GB`` of data and 3 snapshots
         may require less than ``30GB`` of total snapshot storage
         depending on how data changed between snapshots.

         If the existing snapshot storage volume becomes invalid,
         |service| creates a new snapshot storage volume in the same
         region as the cluster's current primary and takes a full-copy
         snapshot. |service| continues using that primary and its
         |aws| region for snapshots
         and snapshot storage. This may result in a higher invoice for
         the few days required to re-establish incremental snapshots.
         The cost per GB for snapshot storage may also change
         depending on the region of the new snapshot target.
         For more information on how |service| manages snapshot
         storage, see :ref:`backup-cloud-provider`.

         When restoring a cluster using a manual download via HTTPS,
         |service| also charges per-hour that the download link remains
         active. Contact MongoDB Support for more information.

         restores <pit-restore>` from cloud provider snapshots.
         :abbr:`PIT (Point-in-Time)` backups are billed based on the disk
         space occupied by the cluster's :term:`oplog` combined with the

backup costs.


Lowering the Monthly Rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`backup-continuous`
  Lowering snapshot frequency or lowering snapshot retention lowers the
  cost per gigabyte. Increasing the snapshot frequency or the snapshot
  retention increases the cost per gigabyte. To modify the snapshot
  frequency or retention for a cluster, see
  :ref:`modify-backup-schedule`.

:ref:`backup-cloud-provider`
  The cost of backups is dependent on the region of the replica set
  member targeted for snapshots. Modifying the
  region configuration for your cluster may reduce the cost per
  gigabyte for snapshot storage. You can change regions by
  :ref:`scaling the cluster <scale-cluster-region>`.

  as a daily uplift on the cost of the associated cluster. You can
  view the rate when :ref:`deploying your cluster <create-new-cluster>`
  or by :doc:`modifying your cluster </scale-cluster>`.

- |bic| has a sustained-usage pricing. That is, the daily rate is
  charged only up to a maximum for the month.

.. _server-number-costs:

Number of Servers
-----------------

|service| charges the cluster cost and data storage cost for each
data-bearing server [#data-bearing]_ in your cluster. For a replica
set, the number of data-bearing servers equals the replication factor.
For a sharded cluster, the number of data-bearing servers equals the
replication factor multiplied by the number of shards.

If you enable sharding, |service| also runs three
:ref:`config servers <sharding-config-server>` in addition to your
data-bearing servers. Your selections for cluster tier and data
storage do not affect the costs of the config servers. Config servers
are charged at a separate rate. Their cost is reflected in the cost of
the cluster.
