Driver Compatibility Tables
===========================

.. meta::
   :description: Explore compatibility tables for MongoDB drivers, detailing server, language, and component compatibility to ensure operational environments.
   :keywords: backwards compatibility, versions, upgrade

.. facet::
   :name: genre
   :values: reference

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 2
   :class: singlecol

The compatibility tables on this page show compatibility between different versions of
the driver, {+mdb-server+}, and the driver language or framework. You can use these
tables to ensure your environment remains operational after an upgrade.

.. note:: Minor Version Compatibility

   If a driver is compatible with a major version of {+mdb-server+}, it is also compatible
   with the minor and patch releases within that major version unless otherwise specified.

      Entity Framework Core Compatibility
      -----------------------------------

      The major version of the MongoDB Entity Framework Core Provider must match the
      major version of Entity Framework Core that your application uses. For example, if your
      application uses Entity Framework Core 8.x, you must use version 8.x of the MongoDB
      Entity Framework Core Provider.
      
      MongoDB Server Compatibility
      ----------------------------

      The Entity Framework Core Provider requires {+mdb-server+} 5.0 or later.

      .NET Compatibility
      ------------------

      The Entity Framework Core Provider requires .NET 8.0 or later.
