  In the :guilabel:`Clusters` view, click the :guilabel:`Connect`
  button for the cluster to which you want to connect.

title: "Whitelist your connection IP address."
level: 4
ref: go-clusters-whitelist-connection
content: |

  |service| only allows client connections to the cluster from entries
  in the :ref:`project's whitelist <whitelist>`. The project whitelist
  is distinct from the :ref:`API whitelist
  <whitelist-for-api-operations>`, which restricts *API* access to
  specific IP or :abbr:`CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)`
  addresses.

  .. note::

     You can skip this step if |service| indicates in the
     :guilabel:`Setup Connection Security` step that you have already
     configured a whitelist entry in your cluster. To manage the IP
     whitelist, see :ref:`Add Entries to the Whitelist <whitelist>`.

  If the whitelist is empty, |service| prompts you to add an IP
  address to the project's whitelist. You can either:

  * Click :guilabel:`Add Your Current IP Address` to whitelist your
    current IP address.

  * Click :guilabel:`Add a Different IP Address` to add a single IP
    address or a CIDR-notated range of addresses.

    For |service| clusters deployed on :ref:`amazon-aws` *and* using
    :ref:`VPC Peering <vpc-peering>`, you can add a Security Group
    associated with the peer :abbr:`VPC (Virtual Private Connection)`.

  You can provide an optional description for the newly added IP
  address or :abbr:`CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)` range.
  Click :guilabel:`Add IP Address` to add the address to the
  whitelist.

title: "Create a MongoDB User."
level: 4
ref: create-mongodb-user
content: |

  To access the cluster, you must create a MongoDB database user with
  access to the desired database(s) on the cluster.

  .. note::

     You can skip this step if |service| indicates in the
     :guilabel:`Setup Connection Security` step that you have at least
     one MongoDB database user configured in your project. To manage
     existing MongoDB database users, see :ref:`Add Database Users
     <mongodb-users>`.
     
  If the project has no MongoDB database users, |service| prompts you to
  create a new user with the :ref:`Atlas Admin <atlas-user-privileges>`
  privilege. Enter the new user's :guilabel:`Username` and
  :guilabel:`Password` and click :guilabel:`Create MongoDB User` to save
  the user. Use this user to connect to your cluster in the following
  step. 

  Once you have whitelisted an IP address and added a MongoDB database
  user, click :guilabel:`Choose Your Connection Method`.
