In a default configuration, the {+mdbagent+}\s and Backup Daemons
access MongoDB installation archives over the Internet from |company|

You can configure |onprem| to run in **Remote Mode** with the 
|k8s-op-short| if the nodes in your |k8s| cluster don't have access to
the Internet. The Backup Daemons and managed MongoDB resources download
installation archives only from |onprem|, which proxies download
requests to an HTTP endpoint on a local web server or S3-compatible 
store deployed to your |k8s| cluster.

This procedure covers deploying an Nginx HTTP server to your |k8s|
cluster to host the MongoDB installation archives.

Prerequisites and Considerations
--------------------------------

:ref:`deploy-om-container`. The following procedure shows you how to
