Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to enable network
compression. The driver provides a connection option to compress messages, which
reduces the amount of data passed over the network between MongoDB and your application.

The driver supports the following compression algorithms:

- `Snappy <https://google.github.io/snappy/>`__: Available in {+mdb-server+} v3.4 and later.
- `Zlib <https://zlib.net/>`__: Available in {+mdb-server+} v3.6 and later.
- `Zstandard <https://github.com/facebook/zstd/>`__: Available in {+mdb-server+} v4.2 and later.

The driver tests against the following versions of these libraries:

- ``{+snappyVersion+}``
- ``{+zstdVersion+}``

If you specify multiple compression algorithms, the driver selects the first one
in the list supported by your MongoDB instance.

.. note::

   Applications that require Snappy or Zstandard compression must
   add explicit dependencies for those algorithms. To learn more,
   see the :ref:`java-compression-dependencies` section of this guide.

.. _java-compression-specify:

Specify Compression Algorithms
------------------------------

You can enable compression for the connection to your MongoDB instance
by specifying the algorithms in one of the following ways: 

- Use the ``compressors`` parameter in your connection string.
- Chain the ``compressorList()`` method to the ``MongoClientSettings.builder()`` method.

Select the :guilabel:`Connection String` or :guilabel:`MongoClientSettings`
tab to see the corresponding syntax:

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Connection String
    :tabid: uri

    Include the following parameters in your connection string to enable compression:

    .. list-table:: 
       :header-rows: 1 
       :widths: 25,20,60

       * - Option Name
         - Type
         - Description

       * - ``compressors``
         - string
         - Specifies one or more compression algorithms that the driver will
           attempt to use to compress requests sent to the connected MongoDB
           instance. Possible values include: ``zlib``, ``snappy``, and
           ``zstd``. 
            
           *Default*: ``null``

       * - ``zlibCompressionLevel``
         - integer
         - Specifies the degree of compression that `Zlib <https://zlib.net/>`__
           uses to decrease the size of requests to the connected MongoDB
           instance. The level can range from ``-1`` to ``9``, with lower values
           compressing faster (but resulting in larger requests) and larger
           values compressing slower (but resulting in smaller requests). 
            
           *Default*: ``null``
   
    The following specifies the order in which the driver will attempt to
    compress requests before they are sent:

    .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/NetworkCompression.java
       :start-after: start-specify-connection-string
       :end-before: end-specify-connection-string
       :language: java
    
    For more information about these parameters, see the `ConnectionString
    <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/ConnectionString.html>`__
    API documentation.

  .. tab:: MongoClientSettings
    :tabid: mongoclientsettings

    Chain the following methods to your ``MongoClientSettings``  constructor to modify the driver's compression behavior:

    .. list-table::
       :widths: 40 60
       :header-rows:  1

       * - Method
         - Description

       * - ``compressorList()``
         - Sets the compressors to use for compressing messages to the server.

    .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/NetworkCompression.java
       :start-after: start-specify-client-settings
       :end-before: end-specify-client-settings
       :language: java

    For more information about the chained methods, see the `MongoClientSettings.Builder
    <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html>`__
    API documentation.

Compression Algorithm Dependencies
----------------------------------

The JDK natively supports `Zlib <https://zlib.net/>`__ compression. However,
Snappy and Zstandard depend on open source Java implementations. To learn more
about these implementations, see the following GitHub repositories:

- `snappy-java <https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java>`__
- `zstd-java <https://github.com/luben/zstd-jni>`__

API Documentation
-----------------

To learn more about any of the methods or types discussed in this
guide, see the following API documentation:
