Monitor CPU usage to determine whether data is retrieved from 
disk instead of memory.

If you are unable to see the usage that triggered the alert, zoom in
on the :guilabel:`Normalized System CPU` chart by clicking and dragging 
your mouse over the period of interest. With a higher-resolution view 
you may be able to identify acute spikes in CPU usage that weren't 
visible in the overview.
