         The ``mongo`` shell is packaged with the MongoDB Server
         Community and Enterprise distributions, and is also available
         for users of Atlas as a client-only download.

         MongoDB binaries are located in a directory that starts with
         "mongodb-"). You should see a file named ``mongo``, which is
         the shell executable.

         If you do not have ``mongo`` shell installed, follow the
         install directions for your environment.
