Cluster Size Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Examples
--------

The following examples <perform this action> using |service| using 
|service| :ref:`tools for automation <arch-center-automation>`.

These examples also apply other recommended configurations, including:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Dev and Test Environments
      :tabid: devtest

      .. include:: /includes/shared-settings-clusters-devtest.rst

   .. tab:: Staging and Prod Environments
      :tabid: stagingprod

      .. include:: /includes/shared-settings-clusters-stagingprod.rst

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: CLI
      :tabid: cli

      .. note::

         Before you
         can create resources with the {+atlas-cli+}, you must:

         - :atlas:`Create your paying organization 
           </billing/#configure-a-paying-organization>` and :atlas:`create an API key </configure-api-access/>` for the
           paying organization.
         - :atlascli:`Install the {+atlas-cli+} </install-atlas-cli/>` 
         - :atlascli:`Connect from the {+atlas-cli+} 
           </connect-atlas-cli/>` using the steps for :guilabel:`Programmatic Use`.

      Create the Organizations
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Run the following command for each business unit:

      For more configuration options and info about this example, 
      see :ref:`atlas-organizations-create`.

      To get the user IDs and organization IDs, see the following
      commands:

      - :ref:`atlas-organizations-list`
      - :ref:`atlas-organizations-users-list`

      Create the Projects
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Run the following command for each application and environment pair. Change the IDs and names to use your values:

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-create-projects.rst

      For more configuration options and info about this example, 
      see :ref:`atlas-projects-create`.

      To get the project IDs, see the following command:

      - :ref:`atlas-projects-list`

      Create One Deployment Per Project
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Dev and Test Environments
            :tabid: devtest

            For your development and testing environments, run the following command for each project that you created. Change
            the IDs and names to use your values:

            .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-create-clusters-devtest.rst

         .. tab:: Staging and Prod Environments
            :tabid: stagingprod

            For your staging and production environments, create the following ``cluster.json`` file for each project that you
            created. Change the IDs and names to use your values:

            .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-json-example-create-clusters.rst

            After you create the ``cluster.json`` file, run the
            following command for each project that you created. The
            command uses the ``cluster.json`` file to create a cluster.

            .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-create-clusters-stagingprod.rst 

      For more configuration options and info about this example, 
      see :ref:`atlas-clusters-create`.

   .. tab:: Terraform
      :tabid: Terraform

      .. note::

         Before you
         can create resources with Terraform, you must:

         - :atlas:`Create your paying organization 
           </billing/#configure-a-paying-organization>` and :atlas:`create an API key </configure-api-access/>` for the
           paying organization. Store your API key as environment
           variables by running the following command in the terminal:

           .. code-block::

              export MONGODB_ATLAS_PUBLIC_KEY="<insert your public key here>"
              export MONGODB_ATLAS_PRIVATE_KEY="<insert your private key here>"

      Create the Projects and Deployments
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Dev and Test Environments
            :tabid: devtest

            For your development and testing environments, create the
            following files for each application and environment 
            pair. Place the files for each application and environment
            pair in their own directory. Change the IDs and names to use your values:

            main.tf
            ```````

            .. include:: /includes/examples/tf-example-main-devtest.rst 

            variables.tf
            ````````````

            .. include:: /includes/examples/tf-example-variables.rst

            terraform.tfvars
            ````````````````

            .. include:: /includes/examples/tf-example-tfvars-devtest.rst

            provider.tf
            ```````````

            .. include:: /includes/examples/tf-example-provider.rst

            After you create the files, navigate to each application and environment pair's directory and run the following
            command to initialize Terraform:

            .. code-block::

               terraform init

            Run the following command to view the Terraform plan:

            .. code-block::

               terraform plan
            
            Run the following command to create one project and one deployment for the application and environment pair. The command uses the files and the |service-terraform| to
            create the projects and clusters:

            .. code-block::

               terraform apply

            When prompted, type ``yes`` and press :kbd:`Enter` to apply
            the configuration.

         .. tab:: Staging and Prod Environments
            :tabid: stagingprod

            For your staging and production environments, create the
            following files for each application and environment 
            pair. Place the files for each application and environment
            pair in their own directory. Change the IDs and names to use your values:

            main.tf
            ```````

            .. include:: /includes/examples/tf-example-main-stagingprod.rst 

            variables.tf
            ````````````

            .. include:: /includes/examples/tf-example-variables.rst

            terraform.tfvars
            ````````````````

            .. include:: /includes/examples/tf-example-tfvars-stagingprod.rst

            provider.tf
            ```````````

            .. include:: /includes/examples/tf-example-provider.rst

            After you create the files, navigate to each application and environment pair's directory and run the following
            command to initialize Terraform:

            .. code-block::

               terraform init

            Run the following command to view the Terraform plan:

            .. code-block::

               terraform plan
            
            Run the following command to create one project and one deployment for the application and environment pair. The command uses the files and the |service-terraform| to
            create the projects and clusters:

            .. code-block::

               terraform apply

            When prompted, type ``yes`` and press :kbd:`Enter` to apply
            the configuration.
