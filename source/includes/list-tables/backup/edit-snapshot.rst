   * - Take snapshots every ... hours and save for ... days

     - Sets how frequently, in hours, |mms| takes a base snapshot of
       the deployment and the number of days |mms| retains base
       snapshots.

          Changes to the snapshot schedule affect your
          :ref:`snapshot storage costs <backup-pricing>`.

   * - Create cluster checkpoint every ... minutes
       (Sharded Clusters only)

     - Sets how frequently, in minutes, |mms| creates a
       :ref:`checkpoint` in between snapshots of a sharded cluster.
       Checkpoints provide restore points that you can use to create
       custom *point-in-time* snapshots.

     - Sets the number of days that |mms| retains daily snapshots.

          |onprem| takes monthly snapshots every 28 days, not by calendar month.
     
   * - Day of Week for Full Snapshot

     - Sets the day of the week when |mms| takes a full snapshot. This
       ensures a recent complete backup.

       .. cond:: onprem

          |onprem| sets the default value to :guilabel:`Sunday`.

      * - Allow point-in-time restores going back

        - Sets the number of days that |mms| retains oplogs alongside
          snapshots.

             To learn how snapshots and point-in-time restores work,
             see :doc:`/tutorial/nav/restore-overview`.

      * - Reference Time of Day (UTC)

        - Sets the time of day at
          `UTC <https://www.timeanddate.com/time/aboututc.html>`_ from
          which the snapshot schedule starts. When you change the
          :guilabel:`Reference Time of Day`, snapshots that are in
          progress remain unaffected. Only snapshots taken after you
          change the reference time follow the updated schedule.

          .. note::

             Changing the reference time changes the time of the next
             scheduled snapshot:

             * If the new reference time is before the current
               reference time, the next snapshot occurs at the new
               reference time tomorrow.

             * If the new reference time is after the current reference
               time, and you make the change before the current
               reference time, the next snapshot occurs at the new
               reference time today.

             * If the new reference time is after the current reference
               time, but you make the change after the current
               reference time, the next snapshot occurs at the new
               reference time tomorrow.
