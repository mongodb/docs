You can view metrics for the |fts| query terms tracked using the
``tracking`` option in the {+atlas-ui+} :guilabel:`Query Analytics` page
for the index that you used to query for the term. To learn how to tag
search terms in your queries, see :ref:`fts-tracking-ref`. 

This page describes the metrics that |service| captures for tracked
queries and how to view the query analytics for an |fts| index in the
{+atlas-ui+}. 

.. note:: 

   You must have an ``M10`` or higher cluster running MongoDB v5.0 or
   higher to view the analytics information for the tracked search terms
   in the {+atlas-ui+}. |fts| doesn't track search terms or display
   analytics for queries on free and shared-tier clusters.

Navigate to the Query Analytics Page 
------------------------------------

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Navigate to the |fts| page for your project.

      a. If it's not already displayed, select the organization that contains your desired project from the :guilabel:`Organizations` menu in the navigation bar.

      #. If it's not already displayed, select your desired project from the :guilabel:`Projects` menu in the navigation bar.

      #. Click your cluster's name.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Atlas Search` tab.

   .. step:: Click the name of the index. 

      The page displays an overview of this index, including
      :guilabel:`Index Configurations` and :guilabel:`Field Mappings` in
      the index definition. The left-hand side of the page also provides 
      navigation options to the following pages in
      the :guilabel:`Atlas Search` tab:

      - :ref:`Index Overview <ref-index-definitions>` - View the
        configuration for this index
      - :ref:`Search Tester <searching-ref>` - Search your collection
        using this index
      - :ref:`Query Analytics <fts-tracking-ref>` - View analytics for your
        queries for tracked terms that used this index 
      - :ref:`Quick Start Tutorials <fts-tutorials>` - Access tutorials
        that can help you incorporate popular search features in your
        application

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Query Analytics` to view analytics for tracked queries run using this |fts| index.

      |service| displays query analytics for queries for tracked
      search terms that were run using only the selected index. 

View Query Analytics for Tracked Search Terms
---------------------------------------------

The :guilabel:`Query Analytics` page displays the following for a
predefined date range such as the current day, last 7 days, last 30
days, or last 90 days, or a custom range (in :abbr:`UTC (Coordinated 
Universal Time)`) that you specify, with a per day granularity:

Metrics for All Tracked $search Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section shows the following metrics: 
            
- :guilabel:`Approx # of Tracked $search Queries` - approximate count of 
  :pipeline:`$search` queries that included the ``tracking`` option.
- :guilabel:`Approx % of Top 10 Tracked Queries` - percentage 
  of :pipeline:`$search` queries with the ``tracking`` option that are
  also the top 10 queries.

The section also shows a graph of the number of tracked queries for the
selected date range.  

You can expand :guilabel:`Show Top Search Queries` below the graph to
view the following metrics:  

.. list-table:: 
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - :guilabel:`Search Terms` 
     - |fts| query terms (one per row).

   * - :guilabel:`Approx #`
     - Approximate number of all tracked :pipeline:`$search` queries for
       the term (in the same row). 
                 
   * - :guilabel:`Approx %`  
     - Approximate percentage of all tracked :pipeline:`$search` queries
       for the term (in the same row). This is the percentage of queries
       with the query term, out of the total number of queries, only on
       days when |service| captured the query during the selected date
       range. 

       .. example:: 

          Given an |fts| query for the term ``coffee``, the percentage
          is calculated as shown below: 

          - 2 queries for ``coffee`` out of a total of 8 queries on
            captured days equals to 16%. 
          - 4 queries for ``coffee`` out of a total of 8 queries on
            captured days equals to 50%.
          - 1 query for ``coffee`` out of a total of 2 queries on
            captured days equals to 50%.

   * - :guilabel:`View`
     - Link to view the following metrics over a predefined or custom
       date range for the term (in the same row): 

       - Number of queries and percentage of tracked queries for the
         term in the selected date range.  
       - Graph of the number of tracked queries for the term during the
         selected date range. 

       Click :guilabel:`View factors affecting data` to open a window
       that displays the days when there were no recorded queries for
       the search term and information about factors that affect the
       metrics that |fts| displays on the page. To learn more, see
       :ref:`fts-factors-affecting-analytics-metrics`. You can click
       :guilabel:`Close` to dismiss the window.

.. _fts-factors-affecting-analytics-metrics:

Factors That Affect Displayed Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many factors affect the metrics that are displayed on the page. 

|fts| query metrics is based on sampling, which can affect the accuracy
of all the displayed metrics. 
                       
In addition, |service| has a limit on the number of unique search terms
that |service| captures each day from tracked :pipeline:`$search`
queries. Once |service| reaches the limit, it doesn't capture new,
unique search terms. The following might be affected if |service|
reaches the limit:

- The approximate percentage of top 10 tracked queries 
- The order in which |service| displays the top search terms

Individual tracked search term metrics might be affected if |service|
stopped capturing before queries for a search term ran. On those days,
|service| doesn't display the number of searches for that search term,
resulting in a gap. 

To learn more, see :ref:`fts-tracking-behavior`.

Follow along with this video to learn how you can use query analytics to
retrieve metrics on the top 10 query terms and query terms for which
|fts| didn't return any results. Also learn how you can use
:ref:`synonyms <synonyms-ref>` to improve the search for terms for which
|fts| didn't return any results.
