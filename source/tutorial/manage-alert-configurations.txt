Default Alert Configurations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mms| creates the following alert configurations for a project automatically
upon creation of the project:

- :alert:`Users awaiting approval to join project`

- :alert:`User joined the project`

.. only:: cloud

   - :alert:`Host is exposed to the public Internet`

- :alert:`Host's SSL certificate will expire within 30 days`

- :alert:`Monitoring Agent is down`

If you enable Backup, |mms| creates the following alert configurations for the
project, if they do not already exist:

- :alert:`Backup oplog is behind`

- :alert:`Backup requires a resync`

- :alert:`Cluster is missing an active mongos`

.. only:: cloud

   If you enter a payment method, |mms| creates the following alert configuration:

   - :alert:`Credit card is about to expire`

.. _settings-for-mms-alert-notifications:

Default Settings for Notification Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Project administrators can configure default settings for the following
notification options:

- PagerDuty

- Flowdock

- HipChat

- Slack

- DataDog

- Webhook

To configure default settings for one of the above notification options,
click :guilabel:`Settings`, then :guilabel:`Project Settings`. Locate the
notification option and enter the default values.

|mms| will fill in the default values automatically when a user selects
that option when creating an alert configuration. If the key, token, or URL
that is used to send the notification becomes invalid, |mms| will send an
email to the project owner and will eventually remove the key, token, or URL.

Considerations
--------------

SMS Delivery
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many factors may affect alert delivery, including do not call lists,
caps for messages sent or delivered, delivery time of day, and message
caching.

Check with your telephone service contract for the costs associated
with receiving text messages.

If you choose SMS, |mms| sends alert text messages to all users in the
project who have filled in their mobile numbers for their accounts.

Alert Intervals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create multiple alert configurations with different
frequencies. The minimum frequency for an alert is 5 minutes. 

The time between re-notifications increases by the frequency amount
every alert cycle up to a maximum of 24 hours. For example, if the
frequency amount is 5 minutes, and the alert condition is first
triggered at 9am, subsequent alerts occur at 9:05am, 9:15am, 9:30am,
etc.

You can set the time to elapse before |mms| sends an alert after an alert
condition occurs. This helps eliminate false positives.

.. _create-alert-configuration:

Create a New Alert Configuration
--------------------------------

When you create a new alert configuration you have the option of using an
existing configuration as a template.

.. include:: /includes/steps/alert-configuration-create.rst

Modify an Alert Configuration
-----------------------------

Each alert configuration has a distribution list, a frequency for sending
the alert, and a waiting period after an alert state triggers before
sending the first alert. The minimum frequency for sending an alert is 5
minutes.

.. include:: /includes/steps/alert-configuration-edit.rst

Delete an Alert Configuration
-----------------------------

If you delete an alert configuration that has open alerts, |mms| cancels
the open alerts whether or not they have been acknowledged and sends no
further notifications.

.. include:: /includes/steps/alert-configuration-delete.rst

Disable or Enable an Alert Configuration
----------------------------------------

When you disable an alert configuration, |mms| cancels active alerts
related to the disabled configuration. The configuration remains visible
but grayed-out and can be later re-enabled. If you need to disable
an alert only for a period of time, you can alternatively :ref:`suspend
alerts <suspend-alerts-during-maintenance-window>`.

To disable or enable an alert configuration:

.. include:: /includes/steps/alert-configuration-disable-enable.rst
