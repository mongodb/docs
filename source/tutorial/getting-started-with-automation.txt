MMS Automation provides an interface for provisioning machines,
configuring MongoDB nodes and clusters, and upgrading your MongoDB
deployment. This tutorial describes configuring |automation| using
systems and infrastructure that you already have configured.

Prerequisites
-------------

Automation Agents may be deployed on a variety of Linux OS including
RHEL 6+, CentOS 6+, Amazon Linux and Ubuntu 12.04+.  To install an Automation Agent
using our RPM or DEB packages, you must have root access to the server.

Procedures
----------

1. Select the :guilabel:`Automation` tab and then select the :guilabel:`Install Agents On Existing Servers`

2. Choose your Operating System and follow the instructions to install the Automation Agent.

3. Repeat Step #2 for *every* server you wish to use in your MongoDB deployment.

4. Wait on the :guilabel:`Very Agents` page until all of your Automation Agents have contacted MMS.

Next Steps
----------

Once you have successfully deployed automation, see
:doc:`/tutorial/manage-deployments-with-automation` to begin using
Automation to manage MongoDB deployments.
