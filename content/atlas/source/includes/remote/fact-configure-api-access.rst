To access the |service| API, you must generate an API key, which gives access to the
API. Each user that will use the API must generate a key. You can have up to
ten API keys associated with your account. Each key can be either enabled or
disabled but all count toward the ten-key limit.

An API key is like a password. Keep it secret.

When accessing |service| through the API, you have the same level of access as
you do through the |service| interface. Your |service| roles apply to both the
interface and the API.

.. important::

   When you generate a key, |service| displays it **one time only**. You must
   copy it. |service| will never display the full key again.

1. On the upper-right hand corner, click on your user name and select
   :guilabel:`Account`.  Click on :guilabel:`Public API Access`.

2. In the :guilabel:`API Keys` section, click :guilabel:`Generate`.

3. Type a description and click :guilabel:`Generate`.

4. If prompted for two-factor authentication, enter the code and click
   :guilabel:`Verify`. Then click :guilabel:`Generate` again.

5. Copy and record the key.

   **Copy the key immediately**. |service| displays the full key one time
   only. You will not be able to view the full key again.

   Record the key in a secure place. After you record the key, click
   :guilabel:`Close`.
