Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to perform
**transactions**. Transactions allow you to perform a series of operations
that change data only if the entire transaction is committed.
If any operation in the transaction does not succeed, the driver stops the
transaction and discards all data changes before they ever become
visible. This feature is called **atomicity**.

In MongoDB, transactions run within logical sessions. A
session is a grouping of related read or write operations that you
want to run sequentially. Sessions enable causal consistency for a group
of operations and allow you to run operations in an **ACID-compliant**
transaction, which is a transaction that meets an expectation of
atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. MongoDB guarantees
that the data involved in your transaction operations remains
consistent, even if the operations encounter unexpected errors.

When using the {+driver-short+}, you can create a new session from a
``Client`` instance as a ``ClientSession`` type. You can improve your
app's performance by reusing your client for multiple sessions and
transactions instead of instantiating a new client each time.

.. warning::

   Use a ``ClientSession`` only in operations running on the
   ``Client`` that created it. Using a ``ClientSession`` with a
   different ``Client`` results in operation errors.

Methods
-------

Create a ``ClientSession`` by using the ``start_session()`` method on your
``Client`` instance. You can then modify the session state using the
methods provided by the ``ClientSession`` type. The following table
describes these methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :stub-columns: 1
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``start_transaction()``
     - | Starts a new transaction, configured according to an optional
         ``TransactionOptions`` parameter, on this session. The session
         must be passed into each operation within the transaction, or
         the operation will run outside of the transaction.
       |
       | Errors returned from operations run within the transaction
         might include a ``TRANSIENT_TRANSACTION_ERROR`` label, which
         indicates that the entire transaction can be ended, then retried
         with the expectation that it will succeed.
       |
       | **Parameter**: ``TransactionOptions``

   * - ``commit_transaction()``
     - | Commits the active transaction for this session. This method returns an
         error if there is no active transaction for the session or the
         transaction was previously ended.
       |
       | This method might return an error that includes an
         ``UNKNOWN_TRANSACTION_COMMIT_RESULT`` label, which 
         indicates that it is unknown if the committed transaction
         satisfies the set write concern. If you encounter this error,
         it is safe to retry the commit until the write concern is
         satisfied or the method returns an error without the label.

   * - ``abort_transaction()``
     - | Ends the active transaction for this session. This method returns an
         error if there is no active transaction for the session or if the
         transaction was committed or ended.

   * - ``with_transaction()``
     - | Starts a transaction on this session and runs the given
         callback, then commits or ends the transaction. When you use
         this method to perform a transaction, the driver automatically
         handles any errors, so you can choose to omit error handling code.
       |
       | Because the callback returns a future and can be run multiple
         times, the Rust language closure borrowing rules for captured
         values can be restrictive. So, the ``with_transaction()``
         method accepts a context parameter that is passed to the callback.
       |
       | **Parameters**: context ``C``, callback ``FnMut(&'a mut
         ClientSession, &'a mut C)``, ``TransactionOptions``

.. important:: Methods That Can Run in Transactions

   To run MongoDB tasks within transactions, you must use the
   ``_with_session()`` suffixed methods. These methods accept a
   ``ClientSession`` instance as a parameter.

   For example, to delete a document, you can generally use the
   ``delete_one()`` method. However, to delete a document within
   a transaction, you must use the ``delete_one_with_session()``
   method and pass the session as a parameter.

Example
-------

The following code defines the ``insert_media()`` callback function that
inserts data into the ``books`` and ``films`` collections:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/transaction.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-callback
   :end-before: end-callback

The following code completes the following actions to perform the
transaction:

1. Creates a session from the client by using the ``start_session()`` method.
#. Uses the ``with_transaction()`` method to start a transaction and run
   the ``insert_media()`` callback function within the transaction.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/transaction.rs
      :language: rust
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin-session
      :end-before: end-session

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Successfully committed transaction!

If you require more control over your transactions, see the `ClientSession API
documentation <{+api+}/struct.ClientSession.html#transactions>`__
to find an example that shows how to manually create and commit a transaction.
