Map-reduce is a data processing paradigm for condensing large volumes
of data into useful *aggregated* results. To perform map-reduce
operations, MongoDB provides the :dbcommand:`mapReduce` database
command.

Consider the following map-reduce operation:

.. include:: /images/map-reduce.rst

In this map-reduce operation, MongoDB applies the *map* phase to each
input document (i.e. the documents in the collection that match the
query condition). The map function emits key-value pairs. For those
keys that have multiple values, MongoDB applies the *reduce* phase, which
collects and condenses the aggregated data. MongoDB then stores the results
in a collection. Optionally, the output of the reduce function may
pass through a *finalize* function to further condense or process the
results of the aggregation.

All map-reduce functions in MongoDB are JavaScript and run
within the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process. Map-reduce operations take the
documents of a single :term:`collection` as the *input* and can perform
any arbitrary sorting and limiting before beginning the map stage.
:dbcommand:`mapReduce` can return the results of a map-reduce operation
as a document, or may write the results to collections.

.. note::

   Map-reduce is unsupported for {+atlas+} free clusters and 
   {+atlas+} serverless instances.
   
Map-Reduce JavaScript Functions
-------------------------------

In MongoDB, map-reduce operations use custom JavaScript functions to
*map*, or associate, values to a key. If a key has multiple values
mapped to it, the operation *reduces* the values for the key to a
single object.

The use of custom JavaScript functions provide flexibility to
map-reduce operations. For instance, when processing a document, the
map function can create more than one key and value mapping or no
mapping. Map-reduce operations can also use a custom JavaScript
function to make final modifications to the results at the end of the
map and reduce operation, such as perform additional calculations.

Map-Reduce Results
-------------------

In MongoDB, the map-reduce operation can write results to a collection
or return the results inline. If you write map-reduce output to a
collection, you can perform subsequent map-reduce operations on the
same input collection that merge replace, merge, or reduce new results
with previous results. See :dbcommand:`mapReduce` and
:doc:`/tutorial/perform-incremental-map-reduce` for details and
examples.

When returning the results of a map-reduce operation *inline*, the
result documents must be within the :limit:`BSON Document Size` limit,
which is currently 16 mebibytes. For additional information on limits
and restrictions on map-reduce operations, see the
:doc:`/reference/command/mapReduce` reference page.

Sharded Collections
-------------------

MongoDB supports map-reduce operations on :ref:`sharded collections
<sharding-background>`.
