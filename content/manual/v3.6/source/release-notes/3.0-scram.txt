Overview
--------

Starting in version 3.0, MongoDB includes support for the :ref:`Salted
Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM)
<authentication-scram>`, which changes how MongoDB uses and stores user
credentials.

If you are starting with a new 3.0+ deployment without any users or
upgrading from a 2.6 database that has no users, **no authentication
schema upgrade to SCRAM is required**. All newly created users will
have the correct format for SCRAM.

For 3.0+ deployments with existing MongoDB Challenge and Response
(MONGODB-CR) user data model, the following procedure upgrades the
authentication schema to SCRAM.

.. admonition:: Recommendation
   :class: important

   SCRAM represents a significant improvement in security over MongoDB
   Challenge and Response (MONGODB-CR), the previous default
   authentication mechanism. For advantages of using SCRAM over
   MONGODB-CR, see :ref:`scram-advantages`.

   As of MongoDB 3.6, MONGODB-CR authentication mechanism is
   deprecated.

   You are strongly urged to upgrade from the MONGODB-CR
   authentication schema to SCRAM. 

.. _upgrade-scram-scenarios:

Existing 2.6 User Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following information details the authentication mechanism used for
MongoDB 3.0+ deployments that contains MONGODB-CR user credentials;
that is, before upgrading the authentication schema.

If you upgraded from version 2.6 with existing user authentication data
to MongoDB 3.0 (or run MongoDB 3.0 binary against the 2.6 data files):

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - MongoDB Users

     - Credentials Stored in 3.0

     - Behavior

   * - Existing challenge-response users
     - MONGODB-CR credentials

     - .. include:: /includes/fact-mongodb-cr-users-drivers.rst

   * - New challenge-response users
     - MONGODB-CR credentials

     - .. include:: /includes/fact-mongodb-cr-users-drivers.rst

If you populated MongoDB 3.0 user data by importing the 2.6 user
authentication data:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - MongoDB Users

     - Credentials Stored in 3.0

     - Behavior

   * - Existing challenge-response users
     - MONGODB-CR credentials

     - .. include:: /includes/fact-mongodb-cr-users-drivers.rst

   * - New challenge-response users

     - SCRAM credentials

     - Requires drivers that support MongoDB 3.0+ features (see
       :ref:`compatibility-driver-versions`). Can only use SCRAM.

Considerations
--------------

Backwards Incompatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-scram-irreversible.rst

.. _considerations-scram-sha-1-drivers:

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To upgrade the authentication model, you must have a user in the
``admin`` database with the role :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase`.

Timing
~~~~~~

Because downgrades are more difficult after you upgrade the user
authentication model, once you upgrade the MongoDB binaries to
version 3.0, allow your MongoDB deployment to run for a day or two
before following this procedure.

This allows 3.0 some time to "burn in" and decreases the likelihood
of downgrades occurring after the user privilege model upgrade. The
user authentication and access control will continue to work as
it did in 2.6.

If you decide to upgrade the user authentication
model immediately instead of waiting the recommended "burn in"
period, then for sharded clusters, you must wait at least 10 seconds
after upgrading the sharded clusters to run the authentication
upgrade command.

Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a replica set, it is only necessary to run the upgrade process on
the :term:`primary` as the changes will automatically replicate to
the secondaries.

Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a sharded cluster, connect to one :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance and run the
upgrade procedure to upgrade the cluster's authentication data. By
default, the procedure will upgrade the authentication data of the
shards as well.

To override this behavior, run :dbcommand:`authSchemaUpgrade` with the
``upgradeShards: false`` option. If you choose to
override, you must run the upgrade procedure on the :binary:`~bin.mongos`
first, and then run the procedure on the :term:`primary` members of
each shard.

For a sharded cluster, do **not** run the upgrade process directly
against the :doc:`config servers
</core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>`. Instead, perform the upgrade
process using one :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance to interact with the
config database.

Upgrade Drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must upgrade all drivers used by applications that will connect to
upgraded database instances to version that support SCRAM. The minimum
driver versions that support SCRAM are:

.. |driver-compatibility-heading| replace:: Version

.. include:: /includes/list-table-3.0-driver-compatibility.rst

See the :ecosystem:`MongoDB Drivers Page </drivers>` for links to
download upgraded drivers.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before upgrading the authentication model, you should first
:doc:`upgrade MongoDB binaries to 3.0 </release-notes/3.0-upgrade>`.
For sharded clusters, ensure that **all** cluster components are 3.0.

.. _3.0-upgrade-mongodb-cr-to-scram:

Upgrade 2.6 ``MONGODB-CR`` User Credentials to SCRAM User Credentials
---------------------------------------------------------------------

.. warning::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-scram-irreversible.rst

.. important::

   To use SCRAM, a driver upgrade is **necessary** if your current
   driver version does not support SCRAM. See :ref:`required driver
   versions <considerations-scram-sha-1-drivers>` for details.

.. include:: /includes/steps/3.0-upgrade-mongodb-cr-to-scram.rst

Result
------

After this procedure is complete, all users in the database will have
SCRAM credentials, and any subsequently-created users will also have
this type of credentials.
