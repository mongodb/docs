title: Disable the Balancer.
level: 4
ref: 3.6-upgrade-disable-balancer
content: |

   Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance in
   the sharded cluster, and run :method:`sh.stopBalancer()` to
   disable the balancer:

   .. cssclass:: copyable-code

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.stopBalancer()

   .. note::

      If a migration is in progress, the system will complete the
      in-progress migration before stopping the balancer. You can run
      :method:`sh.isBalancerRunning()` to check the balancer's current
      state.

   To verify that the balancer is disabled, run
   :method:`sh.getBalancerState()`, which returns false if the balancer
   is disabled:

   .. cssclass:: copyable-code

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.getBalancerState()

   For more information on disabling the balancer, see
   :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily`.

   At this point, you can run the |newversion| binaries without the
   |newversion| :ref:`features that are incompatible
   <3.6-compatibility-enabled>` with |oldversion|. That is, you can run
   the 3.6 sharded cluster with feature compatibility version set to 3.4

   .. important::

      For MongoDB 3.6.0-3.6.3, you should upgrade your drivers to
      :ref:`3.6 feature compatible drivers <3.6-drivers>` only after
      you have updated the feature compatibility version of the sharded
      cluster to 3.6. For more information, see :issue:`SERVER-33763`.

   To enable these |newversion| features, set the feature compatibility
   version (``FCV``) to |newversion|.

      This command must perform writes to an internal system
