Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use indexes with the {+driver-long+}. Indexes can
improve the efficiency of queries and add functionality to querying and storing
documents.

Without indexes, MongoDB must scan *every* document in a collection to find the documents
that match each query. These collection scans are slow and can negatively affect the
performance of your application. However, if an appropriate index exists for a query,
MongoDB can use the index to limit the documents it must inspect.

Query Coverage and Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you execute a query against MongoDB, your query can include various
elements:

- Query criteria that specify fields and values that you are looking for
- Options that affect the query's execution, such as read concern
- Projection criteria to specify the fields you want MongoDB to return
- Sort criteria to specify the order of documents returned from MongoDB

When all the fields specified in the query, projection, and sort are in the same index,
MongoDB returns results directly from that index, also called a **covered query**.

For more information about how to ensure your index covers your query
criteria and projection, see the :manual:`Covered Query </core/query-optimization/#covered-query>`
section in the MongoDB server manual.

Operational Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve query performance, build indexes on fields that appear often in your
application's queries and operations that return sorted results. Each index that you add
consumes disk space and memory when active, so it might be necessary to track index memory
and disk usage for capacity planning. In addition, when a write operation updates an
indexed field, MongoDB also updates the related index.

Since MongoDB supports dynamic schemas, applications can query against fields whose names
cannot be known in advance or are arbitrary. MongoDB 4.2 introduced :manual:`wildcard indexes </core/index-wildcard/>`
to help support these queries. Wildcard indexes are not designed to replace workload-based
index planning.

For more information about designing your data model and choosing indexes
appropriate for your application, see the Server documentation on
:manual:`Indexing Strategies </applications/indexes>` and
:manual:`Data Modeling and Indexes </core/data-model-operations/#indexes>`.

Index Types
-----------

MongoDB provides several different index types to support querying
your data. The following sections describe the most common index types
and provide sample code for creating each index type.

.. note::
  
  These example uses the ``sample_mflix.movies`` and ``sample_mflix.theaters`` collections
  from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
  free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see :ref:`csharp-quickstart`.

Single Field Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Single-field indexes**  are indexes with a reference to a single field within a
collection's documents. They improve single field query and sort performance, and support
:manual:`TTL Indexes </core/index-ttl>` that automatically remove documents from a
collection after a certain amount of time or at a specific clock time.

.. note::

   The ``_id_`` index is an example of a single-field index. This index is automatically
   created on the ``_id`` field when a new collection is created.

The following example creates an index in ascending order on the ``title`` field within
the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Indexes.cs
   :language: csharp
   :start-after: begin-single-index
   :end-before: end-single-index
   :dedent:

The following is an example of a query that is covered by the index
created in the preceding code snippet:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Indexes.cs
   :language: csharp
   :start-after: begin-single-index-query
   :end-before: end-single-index-query
   :dedent:

For more information, see :manual:`Single Field Indexes </core/index-single>` in the Server manual.

Compound Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Compound indexes**  hold references to multiple fields within a collection's documents,
improving query and sort performance.

The following example creates a compound index on the ``type`` and ``rated`` fields within
the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Indexes.cs
   :language: csharp
   :start-after: begin-compound-index
   :end-before: end-compound-index
   :dedent:

The following is an example of a query that is covered by the index
created in the preceding code snippet:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Indexes.cs
   :language: csharp
   :start-after: begin-compound-index-query
   :end-before: end-compound-index-query
   :dedent:

For more information, see :manual:`Compound Indexes </core/index-compound>` in the Server manual.

Multikey Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multikey indexes** collect and sort data from fields containing array values. You can
define a multikey index using the same syntax as a single field or compound index.

The following example creates a compound, multikey index on the ``rated``, ``genres``
(an array of Strings), and ``title`` fields within the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Indexes.cs
   :language: csharp
   :start-after: begin-multi-key-index
   :end-before: end-multi-key-index
   :dedent:

The following is an example of a query that is covered by the index created in the
preceding code snippet:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Indexes.cs
   :language: csharp
   :start-after: begin-multi-key-query
   :end-before: end-multi-key-query
   :dedent:

Multikey indexes behave differently from other indexes in terms of
query coverage, index bound computation, and sort behavior. To learn more about multikey
indexes, including a discussion of their behavior and limitations, see the
:manual:`Multikey Indexes page </core/index-multikey>` in the Server manual.

Clustered Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Clustered indexes** instruct a collection to store documents ordered by a key value.
To create a clustered index, specify the clustered index
option with the ``_id`` field as the key and the ``Unique`` property as
``true`` when you create your collection. A collection can only contain a single clustered
index. If you want to create a clustered index, then it must be specified when you create
a collection.

The following example creates a clustered index on the ``_id`` field while creating a new
``sample_mflix.reviews`` collection:

.. code-block:: csharp

    var database = mongoClient.GetDatabase("sample_mflix");
    var clusteredIndexOptions = new ClusteredIndexOptions<Review>
    { 
        Key = Builders<Review>.IndexKeys.Ascending(r => r.Id),
        Unique = true
    };

    database.CreateCollection("reviews", new CreateCollectionOptions<Review>
    {
        ClusteredIndex = clusteredIndexOptions
    });

To learn more, see
:manual:`Clustered Indexes </reference/method/db.createCollection/#std-label-db.createCollection.clusteredIndex>` and
:manual:`Clustered Collections </core/clustered-collections>` in the Server manual.

.. _search-indexes:

Atlas Search Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Atlas Search feature enables you to perform full-text searches on collections hosted
on MongoDB Atlas. The indexes specify the behavior of the search and which fields to
index.

To learn more about MongoDB Atlas Search, see the :atlas:`Atlas Search Indexes </atlas-search/atlas-search-overview/#fts-indexes>`
documentation.

.. note::

   The Atlas Search Index management methods run asynchronously. The
   driver methods can return before confirming that they ran
   successfully. To determine the current status of the indexes, call the
   `IMongoSearchIndexManager.List() <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Driver/MongoDB.Driver.Search.IMongoSearchIndexManager.List.html>`__ method.

The following sections contain links to tutorials that demonstrate how to create and
interact with Atlas Search indexes.

Create a Search Index
+++++++++++++++++++++

Before you can perform a search on an Atlas collection, you must first
create an Atlas Search index on the collection. To learn how to create an Atlas Search
index using the {+driver-short+}, see :atlas:`Create an Atlas Search Index </atlas-search/create-index/>`
in the Atlas manual and select :guilabel:`C#` from the language dropdown.

List Search Indexes
+++++++++++++++++++

To learn how to view a list of your Atlas Search indexes using the {+driver-short+}, see
:atlas:`View an Atlas Search Index </atlas-search/view-index/>` in the Atlas manual
and select :guilabel:`C#` from the language dropdown.

Update a Search Index
+++++++++++++++++++++

To learn how to modify an existing Atlas Search index using the {+driver-short+}, see
:atlas:`Edit an Atlas Search Index </atlas-search/edit-index/>` in the Atlas manual
and select :guilabel:`C#` from the language dropdown.

Drop a Search Index
+++++++++++++++++++

To learn how to delete an Atlas Search index using the {+driver-short+}, see
:atlas:`Delete an Atlas Search Index </atlas-search/delete-index/>` in the Atlas manual
and select :guilabel:`C#` from the language dropdown.

Text Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Text indexes**  support text search queries on string content. These indexes can
include any field whose value is a string or an array of string elements. MongoDB supports
text search for various languages. You can specify the default language as an option when
creating the index.

.. tip::

   MongoDB offers an improved full-text search solution,
   :atlas:`Atlas Search </atlas-search/>`. To learn more about Atlas Search
   indexes and how to use them, see the :ref:`search-indexes` section of this
   guide.

   Note that text indexes cannot support Atlas Search queries, and Atlas Search indexes
   cannot support text queries.

Single Field
++++++++++++

The following example creates a text index on the ``plot`` field within the
``sample_mflix.movies`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Indexes.cs
   :language: csharp
   :start-after: begin-text-index
   :end-before: end-text-index
   :dedent:

The following query uses the text index created in the preceding code snippet:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Indexes.cs
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-text-query
   :end-before: end-text-query
   :dedent:

Multiple Fields
+++++++++++++++

A collection can only contain one text index. If you want to create a
text index for multiple text fields, you must create a compound
index. A text search runs on all the text fields within the compound
index.

The following snippet creates a compound text index for the ``title`` and ``genre``
fields within the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection:

.. code-block:: csharp

    var indexModel = new CreateIndexModel<Movie>(Builders<Movie>.IndexKeys
        .Text(m => m.Title)
        .Text(m => m.Genre));
    collection.Indexes.CreateOne(indexModel);

For more information, see :manual:`Compound Text Index Restrictions </core/indexes/index-types/index-text/text-index-restrictions/#compound-text-index>`
and :manual:`Text Indexes </core/index-text>` in the Server manual.

.. _geospatial-indexes:

Geospatial Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports queries of geospatial coordinate data using **2dsphere
indexes**. With a 2dsphere index, you can query the geospatial data for
inclusion, intersection, and proximity.

To create a 2dsphere index, you must specify a field that contains
only **GeoJSON objects**. For more details about this type, see :manual:`GeoJSON objects </reference/geojson>`
in the MongoDB Server manual.

The ``location.geo`` field in the following sample document from the
``sample_mflix.theaters`` collection is a GeoJSON Point object that describes the
coordinates of the theater:

.. code-block:: json

   {
      "_id" : ObjectId("59a47286cfa9a3a73e51e75c"),
      "theaterId" : 104,
      "location" : {
         "address" : {
            "street1" : "5000 W 147th St",
            "city" : "Hawthorne",
            "state" : "CA",
            "zipcode" : "90250"
         },
         "geo" : {
            "type" : "Point",
            "coordinates" : [
               -118.36559,
               33.897167
            ]
         }
      }
   }

The following example creates a ``2dsphere`` index on the ``location.geo`` field:

.. important::

   Attempting to create a geospatial index on a field that is already covered by a geospatial index results in an error.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Indexes.cs
   :language: csharp
   :start-after: begin-geospatial-index
   :end-before: end-geospatial-index
   :dedent:

The following is an example of a geospatial query using the "location.geo" index:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Indexes.cs
   :language: csharp
   :start-after: begin-geospatial-query
   :end-before: end-geospatial-query
   :dedent:

MongoDB also supports ``2d`` indexes for calculating distances on a Euclidean plane and
for working with the "legacy coordinate pairs" syntax used in MongoDB 2.2 and earlier.
To learn more, see :manual:`Geospatial Queries </geospatial-queries>` in the Server manual.

Unique Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Unique indexes**  ensure that the indexed fields do not store duplicate values. By
default, MongoDB creates a unique index on the ``_id`` field during the creation of a
collection. To create a unique index, specify the fields that you want to prevent
duplication on and set the ``Unique`` option to ``true``.

The following example creates a unique, descending index on the ``theaterId`` field within
the ``sample_mflix.theaters`` collection.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Indexes.cs
   :language: csharp
   :start-after: begin-unique-index
   :end-before: end-unique-index
   :dedent:

If you attempt to perform a write operation that stores a duplicate value
that violates the unique index, MongoDB will throw an error that resembles
the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   E11000 duplicate key error index

To learn more, see :manual:`Unique Indexes </core/index-unique>` in the Server manual.

Wildcard Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Wildcard indexes** enable queries against unknown or arbitrary fields.
These indexes can be beneficial if you are using a dynamic schema.

The following example creates an ascending wildcard index on all
values of the ``location`` field within the ``sample_mflix.theaters`` collection,
including values nested in subdocuments and arrays:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Indexes.cs
   :language: csharp
   :start-after: begin-wildcard-index
   :end-before: end-wildcard-index
   :dedent:

For more information, see the :manual:`Wildcard Indexes</core/index-wildcard>` page in the
Server manual.

List Indexes
------------

You can use the `List() <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Driver/MongoDB.Driver.IMongoIndexManager-1.List.html>`__
method to retrieve a list of indexes in your collection.

The following example uses the ``List()`` method to list
all indexes in a collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Indexes.cs
   :language: csharp
   :start-after: begin-list-indexes
   :end-before: end-list-indexes
   :dedent:
