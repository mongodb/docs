Server Code Style

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

Basics
------

- Use spaces, no literal tabs.

- 4 spaces per indentation.

- Limit lines to 100 columns.

- Use LF (Unix-style) line endings, not CR-LF (DOS).
  git has a config option in Windows to convert line endings
  automatically (``core.autocrlf``)

- Starting with MongoDB 3.2 code, all code changes must be formatted by Clang-Format 3.6.0 before they
  are checked in. See :ref:`clang-format-label` for more information.

- All new files added to the MongoDB code base should use the following copyright notice
  and AGPL license language, substituting the current year as appropriate:

  .. code-block:: cpp

- For anything that isn't explicitly covered here, default to the
  `Google C++ Style Guide <http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml>`_
  and the `Google JavaScript Style Guide <http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml>`_.

Case
----

Use camelCase for most ``varNames``.
Use ProperCase for names of classes and structs. Use camelCase for instances of such classes.

Comments
--------

Refer to :ref:`getting-started-coding-style-guidelines` for basic guidelines. Otherwise, default to
`<http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml#Comments>`_ for placement of comments.

Inlines
-------

- If you must have long inline functions, put them in a `-inl.h
  <http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml#The_-inl.h_Files>`_
  file.

- If your inline function is a single line long, put it and its decl on
  separate lines:

  .. code-block:: cpp

       int getLength() const {
           return _length;
       }

- If a function is not performance sensitive, and it isn't one
  line long, put it in the cpp file. Keep code out of headers.

Strings
-------

See :file:`util/mongoutils/str.h` and :file:`bson/stringdata.h`

- Use

  .. code-block:: cpp

    str::startsWith()
    str::endsWith()

  and not ``strstr()``.

- Use

  .. code-block:: cpp

     << 'c'

  and not ``<< "c"``.

- Use

  .. code-block:: cpp

     str[0] == '\0'

  and not ``strlen(str) == 0``.

See :ref:`server-string-manipulation`.

Brackets
--------

.. code-block:: cpp

   if (0) {
   } else if (0) {
   } else {
   }

   do {
   } while (0);

Class Members
-------------

.. code-block:: cpp

    class Foo {
    private:
        int _bar;
    };

Functions
---------

Declaration
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: cpp

   void foo(int v, MyType myItem);

Avoid declarations of extern functions in source files. Instead,
``#include`` a proper ``.h`` file. Be sure to match the header filename
to the source filename where the function definition appears.

Definition
~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: cpp

   void foo(int v, MyType myItem) {
   }

Namespaces
----------

.. code-block:: cpp

   namespace foo {
   // Contents of namespace are not indented.
   int foo;
   namespace bar {
   int bar;
   }  // namespace bar
   }  // namespace foo

Assertions
----------

See :ref:`Kernel exception architecture <server-exception-architecture>`

Return Early
------------

- BAD

  .. code-block:: cpp

     int foo() {
        if (x) {
          ...
        }
     }

- GOOD

  .. code-block:: cpp

     int foo() {
        if (!x)
          return;

        ...
     }

Keeps indentation levels down and makes more readable.

Numeric Constants
-----------------

Large, round numeric constants should be written in multiplied form so
that you never need to count digits.

.. code-block:: cpp

   const int tenMillion = 10 * 1000 * 1000;
   const int megabyte = 1024 * 1024;

Explicit Constructors
---------------------

To avoid implicit type conversion, use the ``explicit`` keyword before
constructors that take a single parameter.

#includes
---------

- Use "double quotes" for local code, <angle brackets> for 3rd party or library headers.

  .. code-block:: cpp

     examples:
     #include "mongo/platform/basic.h"
     #include <boost/thread.h>
     #include <vector>

- Always use forward relative path from ``mongo/src/``; do not use ``..``

  .. code-block:: cpp

     correct:
     #include "mongo/db/namespace_details.h"

     incorrect:
     #include "../db/namespace_details.h"

For ``cpp`` Files
-----------------

- Include :file:`mongo/platform/basic.h` first. blank line.

- Include your :file:`.h` file next, if applicable. blank line.

- Include third party headers next, sorted. blank line.

- Include local headers last, sorted.

.. code-block:: cpp

   example for classy.cpp:
   #include "mongo/platform/basic.h"

   #include "mongo/db/classy.h"

   #include <boost/thread/thread.hpp>
   #include <cstdio>
   #include <string>

   #include "mongo/db/db.h"
   #include "mongo/db/namespace_details.h"
   #include "mongo/util/concurrency/qlock.h"

For ``h`` files
---------------

- ``#pragma once`` at the top, after the licence

- Include third party headers first, sorted. blank line.

- Include local headers last, sorted.

- Forward declare, if possible, in lieu of including local headers in
  headers. Only include things that are directly used in the header
  itself.
  
- Do not include :file:`platform/basic.h` in a header; assume that all source 
  files will include it prior to including the header.

File Names
----------

- Class definitions should go in a header file with the same name as
  the class. Insert ``_`` in place of a capital letter. Do not use capital
  letters in filenames. For example:

  - ClassyClass's definition goes in :file:`classy_class.h`.

  - ClassyClass's member function implementations go in :file:`classy_class.cpp`.

- Do not be afraid to make another file, even if it is small.
  This is preferable to inserting your new class into a preexisting
  file.

Casting
-------

- Do not use C-style casts, ever.

- Use ``static_cast<>`` as needed.  Use ``const_cast<>`` when no other solutions will work.

- Be aware that ``dynamic_cast<>``, unlike other casts, is done at run-time and calls a function.
  You should always check the return status of ``dynamic_cast<>`` for ``null``.

- ``reinterpret_cast<>`` should be used sparingly and is typically done
  for converting structures to raw bytes for use with I/O drivers.

RAII and Bare vs. Smart Pointers
--------------------------------

- Aspire to embrace RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)

- When writing functions that take or return bare pointers, document
  the ownership semantics in a header comment.

  - Is the caller responsible for managing returned pointer's memory?

  - Does the callee take ownership of the pointed-to parameter, or does
    the caller retain ownership?

  Prefer caller-retains ownership of parameters and takes ownership of
  returned pointers, but use the appropriate policy for each situation.

- Generally, bare calls to ``delete`` and ``free()`` are red flags

  - except in destructors

- Use smart pointers such as ``std::unique_ptr`` and
  ``std::shared_ptr`` (know the difference between them!) to avoid memory
  leaks and ensure all ``new``'s and ``malloc``'s are paired with ``delete``'s and
  ``free``'s

- Use ``ON_BLOCK_EXIT`` or ``ScopeGuard`` to protect other resources that must be released

  - e.g. ``fopen``/``fclose`` pairs

  - Or, write an object to do this for you via constructor and destructor

Fields that Include Units
-------------------------

In things like ``serverStatus``, include the units in the stat name if
there is any chance of ambiguity. For example:

- ``writtenMB``

- ``timeMs``

We should have standards for these -- i.e. megabytes should always be
``MB`` and not ``Mb`` and ``Megabytes`` in different places. So the
standards are:

- For bytes: use ``MB`` and show in megabytes unless you know it will be
  tiny. Note you can use a float so ``0.1MB`` is fine to show.

- For time: use millis (``Ms``) for time by default. You can also use
  Secs and a float for times you know will be very long.

- For microseconds, use ``Micros`` as the suffix, e.g., ``timeMicros``.

.. _clang-format-label:

Clang-Format
------------

As of the 3.2 code, MongoDB  uses  `Clang-Format
<http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html>`_ version 3.6.0 to enforce coding
style. Clang-Format is a C/C++ code formatting tool that uses the config file
located at ``src/mongo/.clang-format`` to control the format of the code.

.. important::
    All code changes must be formatted by clang-format before they are checked in.

Plugins are available for most editors that will automatically run clang-format on file save.
It is recommended to use one of these plugins.

Use the Python script ``buildscripts/clang_format.py`` to check that the code is
formatted correctly as well as to reformat the code.

To lint code:
  .. code-block:: sh

     python buildscripts/clang_format.py lint

To format code:
  .. code-block:: sh

     python buildscripts/clang_format.py format
