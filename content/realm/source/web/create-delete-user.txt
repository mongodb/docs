.. _web-create-user:

Create a User
-------------

For most :ref:`authentication methods <authentication-providers>`, Atlas App Services 
automatically creates a :ref:`user account <user-accounts>` the first time 
a user authenticates. The only exception is email/password authentication. 
When you use email/password authentication, you must :ref:`register 
<web-email-password-register-new-user>` and :ref:`confirm 
<web-email-password-complete-confirmation>` a user before the user can 
authenticate to an App.

.. _web-delete-user:

Delete a User
-------------

.. versionadded:: 1.7.0

Call the ``App.deleteUser()`` on a user object to delete 
the user's account from your Realm application. This deletes the account from
the server in addition to clearing local data.


.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/authenticate.snippet.delete-user.js
   :language: javascript

To use your app in the future, the user must sign up for a new account. 
They can use the same credentials (depending on the authentication provider),
but will not have the same User ID as their deleted account.

.. important:: Deleting All User Data

   Deleting a user only deletes the :ref:`user object <user-objects>`, 
   which may contain associated metadata from the associated auth provider. 
   This does not delete :ref:`custom user data <web-access-custom-user-data>`
   or other user data that your app stores in a linked collection or external services.

   Use the :ref:`Authentication Trigger DELETE event <authentication-event-operation-types>`
   to programmatically clean up other data when you delete a user. For example, you can delete the user's data from your custom user data collection or another service.
