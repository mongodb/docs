.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. operator:: $polygon

   .. versionadded:: 1.9

   Use :operator:`$polygon` to specify a polygon for a bounded query
   using the :operator:`$within` operator for :term:`geospatial`
   queries. To define the polygon, you must specify an array of
   coordinate points, as in the following:

       [ [ x1,y1 ], [x2,y2], [x3,y3] ]

   The last point specified is always implicitly connected to the
   first. You can specify as many points, and therefore sides, as you
   like. Consider the following bounded query for documents with
   coordinates within a polygon:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { loc: { $within: { $polygon: [ [0,0], [3,6], [6,0]  ] } } } )
