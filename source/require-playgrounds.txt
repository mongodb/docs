You can use the `require()
<https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_require_id>`__ function in
your playgrounds to reuse code in your playgrounds. The code you
include with ``require()`` can be either:

- A native Node module (such as `fs
  <https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_file_system>`__)

- An external Node module downloaded from `npm
  <https://www.npmjs.com/>`__

- A local JavaScript file

Use Cases
---------

Using ``require()`` to import code helps keep your playgrounds
organized. If you are often performing the same tasks in your
playgrounds, you can use ``require()`` to reuse code and avoid writing
full functions in each of your playgrounds.

For example, consider the following scenarios where reusing code can
simplify logic and improve productivity:

- You need to ensure that documents are inserted with a consistent
  structure. You can import a JavaScript file to validate the data
  format before the playground script performs the insert.

- You store monetary data and want to convert values between different
  currencies. You can import a JavaScript function to perform conversion
  calculations.

- You need to import data from files on your local computer. You can use
  the native Node module ``fs`` to read data from local files.
