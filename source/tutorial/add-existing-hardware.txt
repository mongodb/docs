=============================
Add Existing Servers to |mms|
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can allow |mms| to install, manage, and discover MongoDB processes on
your existing servers. To do so, you install the :doc:`Automation Agent
</tutorial/nav/install-automation-agent>` on each server.

Prerequisites
-------------

Ensure that the :ref:`directories used by the
Automation Agent <automation-agent-directories>` have appropriate
permissions for the user running the agent.

You can install the Automation Agent on the operating systems listed in
|mms| on the :guilabel:`Administration` tab's :guilabel:`Agents` page.

To install the agent using ``rpm`` or ``deb`` packages, you must have root
access.

.. important::

   If a server runs :term:`MongoDB Enterprise`, you must install the
   :ref:`prerequisite packages <mongodb-enterprise-dependencies>` on the
   server before deploying MongoDB Enterprise on the servers.

Procedure
---------

Install the Automation Agent on each each server that you want |mms| to
manage. The following procedure applies to all operating systems. For
instructions for a specific operating system, see
:doc:`/tutorial/nav/install-automation-agent`.
