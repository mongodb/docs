Release Notes for MongoDB 2.4 (2.3 Development Series)
======================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB 2.4 is currently in development, as part of the 2.3
development release series. While 2.3-series releases are currently
available, these versions of MongoDB are for **testing** *only*, and
are *not for production use* under any circumstances.

*All* interfaces *and* functionality described in this document are
subject to change before the 2.4.0 release.

This document will eventually contain the full release notes for
MongoDB 2.4; during the development cycle this document will contain
documentation of new features and functionality only available in the
2.3 releases.

Additional Authentication Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   These features are only present in the `MongoDB Subscriber Edition
   <https://www.10gen.com/mongodb-subscriber-edition-download>`_. To
   download 2.3 development releases of the Subscriber Edition, use
   the following resources:

   - `Amazon Linux 6.4 <http://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.10gen.com/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-subscription-amzn64-2.3.1.tgz>`_
   - `Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 <http://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.10gen.com/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-subscription-rhel62-2.3.1.tgz>`_
   - `Ubuntu 11.04 <http://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.10gen.com/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-subscription-ubuntu1104-2.3.1.tgz>`_
   - `SUSE 11 <http://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.10gen.com/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-subscription-suse11-2.3.1.tgz>`_

An improved authentication system is a core focus of the entire 2.3
cycle, as of 2.3.1, the following components of the new authentication
system are available for use in MongoDB:

- SASL Support in :program:`mongod`, the :program:`mongo` shell, and C++ client library
  (driver.)

- New :dbcommand:`acquirePrivilege`, :dbcommand:`saslBegin`, and :dbcommand:`saslContinue`
  database commands.

.. note::

   As of 2.3.1 support for SASL/Kerberos in :program:`mongos` is
   forthcoming. Test Kerberos with standalone :program:`mongod`
   instances and :term:`replica sets <replica set>`.

Initial SASL/Kerbros  Support
`````````````````````````````

Development work on this functionality is ongoing, and additional
related functionality is forthcoming. To use Kerberos with MongoDB as
of the current 2.3-series release, consider the following requirements:

- add users to MongoDB as with the existing authentication
  mechanism:

  - Usernames *must* correspond to the Kerberos
    principal (e.g. ``<username>@<REALM>`` as in
    ``mongodbuser@EXAMPLE.COM``),

  - You *must* have a user document in the :data:`system.users
    <<database>.system.users>` collection with the Kerberos principal
    for any database that you want to grant access.

- every :program:`mongod` using Kerberos must have a fully resolvable
  fully qualified domain name. This includes all members of replica
  sets.

- every :program:`mongod` using Kerberos must have a Kerberos service
  principal, in the form of: ``mongodb/<fqdn>@<REALM>``.

- each system running a :program:`mongod` with Kerberos must have a
  key tab file that holds key data granting access to it's principal
  that the :program:`mongod` can read.

To start :program:`mongod` with support for Kerberos, use the
following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   env KRB5_KTNAME=<path to keytab file> <mongod invocation>

You must start :program:`mongod` with :setting:`auth` or
:setting:`keyfile`, [#keyfile-auth]_ so that an actual command would
resemble:

.. code-block:: sh

   env KRB5_KTNAME=/opt/etc/mongodb.keytab /opt/bin/mongod --auth --dbpath /opt/data/db --logpath /opt/log/mongod.log --fork

Replace the paths as needed for your test deployment.

To use Kerberos with the :program:`mongo` shell, begin by initializing
a Kerberos session with ``kinit``. Then start a 2.3.1 or greater
:program:`mongo` shell instance, and run the following operations to
associate the current connection with the Kerberos session:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getMongo().saslAuthenticate( {mechanism: "GSSAPI", principal: "<username>@<REALM>"} )

The value of the ``principal`` field *must* be the same principal that
you initialized with ``kinit``. Continue to gain privileges using the
:dbcommand:`acquirePrivilege` in an operation that resembles the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { acquirePrivilege: 1, resource: <dbname>, principal: <principalName>, actions: [ <actionString> ] } )

Replace the ``<dbname>`` with the name of the database you want
privileges, replace ``<principalName>`` with the Kerberos principal
you initialized with ``kinit``. The ``<actionString>`` list, contains
the privileges you are acquiring, currently this value must be either:

- ``oldRead``, or

- ``oldWrite``.

The ``oldRead`` action string corresponds to the "*read only*"
privileges in the existing authentication system, while ``oldWrite``
corresponds to the existing "*read/write*" privileges.

.. see:: :doc:`/security`

.. [#keyfile-auth] :setting:`keyfile` implies :setting:`auth`, and you
   *must* use :setting:`keyfile` for replica sets.

New Authentication Control Database Commands
````````````````````````````````````````````

In the 2.3 series, MongoDB adds the following database commands:

.. leaving these undocumented at the moment, given changing use, and
   the fact that the previous section satisfies current requirements.

.. dbcommand:: acquirePrivilege

.. dbcommand:: saslBegin

.. dbcommand:: saslContinue


Default Java Script Engine Switched to v8 from SpiderMonkey
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default JavaScript engine used throughout MongoDB, for the
:program:`mongo` shell, :dbcommand:`mapReduce`, :operator:`$where`,
and :dbcommand:`eval` is now v8.

.. data:: db.serverBuildInfo().interpreterVersion

   The :data:`interpreterVersion` field of the document output by
   :method:`db.serverBuildInfo()` in the :program:`mongo` shell
   reports which JavaScript interpreter the :program:`mongod` instance
   is running.

.. method:: interpreterVersion()

   The :method:`interpreterVersion()` in the :program:`mongo` shell
   reports which JavaScript interpreter this :program:`mongo` shell
   uses.

New Geospatial Indexes with GeoJSON and Improved Spherical Geometry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 2.3 series adds a new type of geospatial index that supports
improved spherical queries and GeoJSON. Create the index by specifying
``s2d`` as the value of the field in the index specification, as
any of the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { geo: "s2d" } )
   db.collection.ensureIndex( { type: 1, geo: "s2d" } )
   db.collection.ensureIndex( { geo: "s2d", type: 1 } )

In the first example you create a spherical geospatial index on the
field named ``geo``, in the second example, you create a compound
index where the first field is a normal index, and the index of the
second field is a spherical geospatial index. Unlike ``2d`` indexes,
fields indexed using the ``s2d`` type can do not have to be the first
field in a compound index.

You must store data in the fields indexed using the ``s2d`` index
using the `GeoJSON`_ specification, at the moment. Support for storing
points, in the form used by the existing ``2d`` (i.e. geospatial)
indexes is forthcoming. Currently, ``s2d`` indexes only support
the following GeoJSON shapes:

- ``Point``, as in the following:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 40, 5 ] }

- ``LineString``, as in the following:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ 40, 5 ], [ 41, 6 ] ] }

- ``Polygon``, as in the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ 40, 5 ], [ 40, 6 ], [ 41, 6 ], [ 41, 5 ], [ 40, 5 ] ] }

To query ``s2d`` indexes, all current geospatial :ref:`query operators
<query-selectors-geospatial>` with an additional
:operator:`$intersect` operator. Currently, all queries using the
``s2d`` index must pass the query selector (e.g. :operator:`$near`,
:operator:`$intersect`) a GeoJSON document. With the exception of the
GeoJSON requirement, the operation of :operator:`$near` is the same
for ``s2d`` indexes as ``2d`` indexes.

.. operator:: $intersect

   The :operator:`$intersect` selects all indexed points that
   intersect with provided geometry. (i.e. ``Point``, ``LineString``,
   and ``Polygon``.) You must pass :operator:`$intersect` a document
   in GeoJSON format.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { $intersect: { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 40, 5 ] } } )

   This query will select all indexed objects that intersect with the
   ``Point`` with the coordinates ``[ 40, 5 ]``. MongoDB will return
   documents as intersecting if they have a shared edge.

``mongod`` Automatically Continues in Progress Index Builds Following Restart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your :program:`mongod` instance was building an index when it
shutdown or terminated, :program:`mongod` will now continue building
the index when the :program:`mongod` restarts. Previously, the index
build *had* to finish building before :program:`mongod` shutdown.

To disable this behavior the 2.3 series adds a new run time option,
:setting:`noIndexBuildRetry` (or via,q ``--noIndexBuildRetry`` on the
command line,) for :program:`mongod`. :setting:`noIndexBuildRetry`
prevents :program:`mongod` from continuing rebuilding indexes that did
were not finished building when the :program:`mongod` last shut down.

.. setting:: noIndexBuildRetry

   By default, :program:`mongod` will attempt to rebuild indexes upon
   start-up *if* :program:`mongod` shuts down or stops in the middle
   of an index build. When enabled, run time option prevents this
   behavior.

New Hashed Index and Sharding with a Hashed Shard Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support an easy to configure and evenly distributed shard key, version 2.3 adds a
new "``hashed``" index type that indexes based on hashed values. This
section introduces and documents both the new index type and its use
in sharding:

Hashed Index
````````````

The new ``hashed`` index exists primarily to support automatically
hashed shard keys. Consider the following properties of hashed
indexes:

- Hashed indexes must only have a single field, and cannot be compound
  indexes.

- Fields indexed with hashed indexes must *not* hold arrays. Hashed
  indexes cannot be multikey indexes.

- Hashed indexes cannot have a ``unique`` constraint.

  You *may* create hashed indexes with the ``sparse`` property.

- MongoDB can use the hashed index to support equality queries, but
  cannot use these indexes for range queries.

- Hashed indexes offer no performance advantage over normal indexes.
  *However*, hashed indexes may be smaller than a normal index when
  the values of the indexed field are larger than 64 bits. [#hash-size]_

- it's possible to have a hashed and non-hased index on the same
  field: MongoDB will use the non-hashed for range queries.

.. _hashed-index-warning:

.. warning::

   Hashed indexes round floating point numbers to 64-bit integers
   before hashing. For example, a hashed index would store the same
   value for a field that held a value of ``2.3`` and ``2.2``. To
   prevent collisions do not use a hashed index for floating point
   numbers that cannot be consistently converted to 64-bit integers (and
   then back to floating point.) Hashed indexes do not support
   floating point values larger than 2\ :sup:`53`.

Create a hashed index using an operation that resembles the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.ensureIndex( { a: "hashed" } )

This operation creates a hashed index for the ``records`` collection
on the ``a`` field.

.. [#hash-size] The hash stored in the hashed index is 64 bits long.

Hashed Sharding
```````````````

To shard a collection using a hashed shard key, issue an operation in
the :program:`mongo` shell that resembles the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.shardCollection( "records.active", { a: "hashed" } )

This operation shards the ``active`` collection in the ``records``
database, using a hash of the ``a`` field as the shard
key. Consider the following properties when a hashed shard key:

- As with other kinds of shard key indexes, if your collection has
  data, you must create the hashed index before sharding. If you
  collection does not have data, sharding the collection will create
  the appropriate index.

- The :program:`mongos` can route all equality queries to a specific
  shards or set of shards using the hashed index; however, the
  :program:`mongos` must route range queries to all shards.

- When using a hashed shard key on a collection without data, MongoDB
  automatically pre-splits the range of 64-bit hash values into
  chunks. By default, the initial number of chunks is equal to twice
  the number of shards at creation time. You can change the number of
  chunks created, using the ``numInitialChunks`` option, as in the
  following invocation of ``numInitialChunks``:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.adminCommand( { shardCollection: "test.collection", key: { a: "hashed"}, numInitialChunks: 9001 } )

.. warning::

   Avoid using hashed shard keys when the hashed field has floating
   point values, see :ref:`hashed indexes <hashed-index-warning>` for
   more information.
