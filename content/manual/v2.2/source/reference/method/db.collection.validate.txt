.. method:: db.collection.validate()

   :param Boolean full: Optional. Specify ``true`` to enable a full
                        validation. MongoDB disables full validation
                        by default because it is a potentially
                        resource intensive operation.

   Provides a wrapper around the :dbcommand:`validate` :term:`database
   command`. Call the :method:`db.collection.validate()` method on a
   collection object, to validate the collection itself. Specify the
   full option to return full statistics.

   The :dbcommand:`validation <validate>` operation scans all of the
   data structures for correctness and returns a single
   :term:`document` that describes the relationship between the
   logical collection and the physical representation of that data.

   The output can provide a more in depth view of how the collection
   uses storage. Be aware that this command is potentially resource
   intensive, and may impact the performance of your MongoDB
   instance.
