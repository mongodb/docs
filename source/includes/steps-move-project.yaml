  .. admonition:: Billing a Moved Project

    An :authrole:`Organization Owner` of two different Organizations can
    move projects between those Organizations at any time. Usage in any
    particular project during any particular hour is accrued to the
    Organization under which the project was at that time.

    .. example::

        An Organization Owner owns the **Telecomm** and **Storage**
        Organizations in |service|. They decide to move their **Backup**
        project from **Telecomm** to **Storage** at 11:40 am.

        The **Telecomm** project is billed for the full 11:00 to 11:59
        am hour. **Storage** starts getting billed at 12:00 pm.
