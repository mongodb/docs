The {+atlas-admin-api+} follows the principles of the |rest| 
architectural style to expose a number of internal resources which 
enable programmatic access to |service|'s features.

As with changes made through the |service| web interface, changes made
through the {+atlas-admin-api+} are subject to |service| :doc:`billing
</billing>`. If you incur charges, you must have a valid credit card on
file with |service| or risk having your account locked.

The |api| has the following features:

Resource Versioning 
  |service| provides a versioned {+atlas-admin-api+}, which includes
  versioning at the individual {+atlas-admin-api+} resource-level. Use
  these resources and the following sections to learn more about the 
  {+atlas-admin-api+}: 

  - :ref:`API Versioning Overview <api-versioning-overview>`
  - :ref:`Migration Guide <atlas-migrate-api-version>`
  - :ref:`API Specification <api-resources-spec>`
  - :ref:`API Changelog <versioned-api-changelog>`

|json| entities
  All entities are expressed in |json|.

Browsable interface
  Using a consistent linking mechanism, you can browse the entire
  {+atlas-admin-api+} by starting at the root resource and following
  links to related resources.

|https|-Only
  You can only access the {+atlas-admin-api+} via |https|, ensuring all 
  data sent over the network is fully encrypted using |tls|.

User Access Control
  Each |service| user's {+atlas-admin-api+} capabilities match the
  permissions granted by their :ref:`user-roles`.

  .. example::

     A user with the :authrole:`Project Read Only` role in a |service|
     project can't modify any resource within that project whether
     through the |service| user interface or the {+atlas-admin-api+}. 

|api| Network Access List
  |service| can secure access to its {+atlas-admin-api+} through an
  |api| :ref:`access list <enable-api-access-list>`. This list restricts
  access to the |api| to specific IP or |cidr| addresses. Each
  :ref:`authentication method <api-authentication>` has its
  own {+atlas-admin-api+} access list. When you create a new
  organization using the {+atlas-ui+}, |service| enables the |api|
  access list requirement by default.

     :ref:`atlas-admin-api-access`.

|http| Methods
--------------

All resources support a subset of these common |http| Methods:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Method
     - Purpose

   * - ``GET``
     - Retrieve the |json| representation of a resource.

   * - ``POST``
     - Create a new resource using the provided |json| representation.

   * - ``PUT``
     - Replace a resource with the provided |json| representation.

   * - ``PATCH``
     - Update the specified fields in a resource using the provided
       |json| representation.

   * - ``DELETE``
     - Remove a resource.

   * - ``HEAD``
     - Returns the response header without the |json| representation of
       the resource.

|json|
------

All entities are represented in |json|. The following rules and
conventions apply:

- **Content Type Request Header**

  When sending |json| to the server via ``POST`` or ``PUT``, make sure
  to specify the correct content type request header: ``Content-Type:
  application/json``.

- **Invalid Fields**

  Invalid fields are *rejected* rather than *ignored*. For example,
  if you attempt to create a new entity and misspell one of the fields, or
  attempt to update an existing entity and include a field that
  can't be modified, the server responds with a 400 status code and an
  error message stating which field is invalid.

- **ISO-8601-Formatted Dates**

  All dates are returned as `ISO-8601`_-formatted strings designated in
  UTC. When sending dates to the server (i.e., as query parameters or
  fields in ``POST`` or ``PATCH`` request entities), use
  ISO-8601-formatted dates. If you do not specify a time zone, UTC is
  assumed. However, it is highly recommended that you include a time
  zone designator to avoid any ambiguity.

- **BSON Timestamps**

  In some cases, a timestamp is returned as a `BSON timestamp`_, most
  notably in the backup resources. These are represented in |json|
  documents as an object with two fields: ``date``, which is an
  ISO-8601-formatted date string in UTC with granularity to the second,
  and ``increment`` a 32-bit integer.

- **Field Names for Fields with Numbers**

  Fields that contain numeric values in a particular unit will be named
  so as to disambiguate the unit being used.

  .. FUTURE: add an example to above para similar to the one in the
     Cloud/Ops docs:
     For example, a host's uptime is returned in milliseconds, so the name of
     the host entity field is ``uptimeMsec``.

- **Empty Fields**

  Fields that do not have a current value are returned with an
  appropriate default value.

  .. FUTURE: add an example to above para similar to the one in the
     Cloud/Ops docs:
     For example, |service| will not have any statistics for a newly
     discovered host, so any statistics-related fields will have a value of
     zero.

  Fields that do not have a sensible default value are omitted from the
  entity.

  .. FUTURE: add an example to above para similar to the one in the
     Cloud/Ops docs:
     For example, a host that is not using authentication will omit the
     ``username`` field from the returned entity.

- **Field Order**

  The fields in the |json| documents returned by the server are in no
  particular order, and the order may change. Do not depend on the
  order of the fields.

.. _atlas-api-linking:

Linking
-------

Each resource includes one or more links to sub-resources and/or
related resources. Links are placed in the ``links`` field of an
entity, which is an array of link relation objects. Each link relation
has two fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``rel``
     - Name (or type) of the relation. Many of these are considered
       Extension Relation Types and are prefixed by
       ``http://mms.mongodb.com``.

   * - ``href``
     - The target |url|.

All entities include at least one link relation called ``self``, which
is simply its own |url|. When an entity is part of a list, then it only
includes the ``self`` link relation.

.. FUTURE: Add an example similar to the example in the Cloud/Ops docs.

For more information, refer to the `Web Linking Specification
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8288>`_. Note that although the
specification describes a format for including links in the |http|
response headers, doing so is not a requirement. To make the
{+atlas-admin-api+} easily browsable, it includes the links in the
response body rather than in the response headers.

.. _atlas-api-lists:

Lists
-----

Some resources return a list of entities. When a list of entities is
expected in a response, the results are returned in batches bounded by
the following query parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``pageNum``
     - Page number (1-based). Defaults to ``1`` if not specified.

   * - ``itemsPerPage``
     - Number of items to return per page, up to a maximum of 500.
       Defaults to ``100`` if not specified.

   * - ``includeCount``
     - Specifies whether the response returns the ``totalCount`` field.
       Defaults to ``true`` if not specified. 

The response entity contains three fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``totalCount``
     - The total number of items in the entire result set.

   * - ``results``
     - The result set, which is an array of entity documents.

   * - ``links``
     - Contains one to three link relations: ``previous`` for the
       previous page of results (omitted for the first page); ``next``
       for the next page of results (omitted for the last page); and
       ``self`` for the current page (always present).

If you make a request for a list of entities and there are no results,
then the {+atlas-admin-api+} responds with a 200 status code and the ``results``
array is empty. It does *not* respond with a 404 in this case, since
the list of entities may not be empty at some point in the future.
However, if you request a list of entities in a context that does not
exist (e.g., the list of hosts for a non-existent project), then this
*does* result in a 404 response status.

.. FUTURE: Add an example similar to the example in the Cloud/Ops docs.

.. _api-envelope:

Envelopes
---------

Some clients might not be able to access the |http| response headers
and/or status code. In that case, you can request that the response
include an "envelope," which is simply an extra layer of information in
the |json| document and contains any relevant details that would
normally be in the response headers. By default, the {+atlas-admin-api+}
does *not* include the response in an envelope. To request one, simply
add the query parameter ``envelope=true``.

For responses that contain a single entity, the envelope contains two
fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``status``
     - The |http| status code.

   * - ``content``
     - The requested entity.

For responses that contain a list of entities, there is already an
envelope that wraps the results, so specifying ``envelope=true`` only
adds the ``status`` field to the existing envelope.

Pretty Printing
---------------

By default, extraneous whitespace is stripped from the |json| returned
by the server. To ask for pretty-printed |json|, simply append the
``pretty=true`` query parameter to any request:

.. code-block:: shell
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   curl --user '{USERNAME}:{APIKEY}' --digest \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --include \
     --request GET "https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/atlas/v1.0?pretty=true"

Response Codes
--------------

Responses use the standard |http| response codes, including:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 5 20 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Code
     - Meaning
     - Notes

   * - 200
     - OK
     - The request was successful. This is typically the response to a
       successful ``GET`` request.

   * - 201
     - Created
     - A new resource was created. This is typically the response to a
       successful ``POST`` request.

   * - 202
     - Accepted
     - A request for an asynchronous operation was accepted.

   * - 400
     - Bad Request
     - Something was wrong with the client request.

   * - 401
     - Unauthorized
     - Authentication is required but was not present in the request.
       Typically this means that the authentication information
       was omitted from the request, the provided credentials are
       incorrect, or the user associated with the given
       authentication method is not allowed to access the requested
       resource. 

   * - 403
     - Forbidden
     - Access to the specified resource is not permitted.

   * - 404
     - Not Found
     - The requested resource does not exist.

   * - 405
     - Method Not Allowed
     - The |http| method is not supported for the specified resource.
       Keep in mind that each resource may only support a subset of |http| methods.
       For example, you can't ``DELETE`` the root resource.

   * - 409
     - Conflict
     - This is the response to a request to create or modify
       a property of an entity that is unique when an existing entity
       already exists with the same value for that property.

   * - 5xx
     - Various server errors
     - Something unexpected went wrong. Try again later and consider
       notifying |service| Support.

Errors
------

When a request returns an error, the response body contains a |json|
document. This document includes details about why the
{+atlas-admin-api+} request failed. The document contains five
parameters: 

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 14 66

   * - Parameter
     - Data Type
     - Description

   * - detail
     - string
     - Human-readable description that |service| returns for the errant
       {+atlas-admin-api+} request.

   * - error
     - integer
     - :rfc:`Status code <2616#section-6.1.1>` returned in the
       header of the |http| response.

   * - errorCode
     - string
     - Named constant that represents the errant {+atlas-admin-api+}
       request. To learn about these constants, see
       :ref:`atlas-api-error-codes`. 

   * - parameters
     - array
     - List of parameters included in the {+atlas-admin-api+} request.

   * - reason
     - string
     - :rfc:`Status code definition <2616#section-6.1.1>` returned in
       the header of the |http| response.

.. example::

   |service| returns the following response body when you make a
   request in the incorrect format:

   .. code-block:: json
      :copyable: false
      :linenos:

      {
        "detail" : "Cannot find resource /api/atlas/v1.0/softwareComponents/version.",
        "error" : 404,
        "errorCode" : "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
        "parameters" : [ "/api/atlas/v1.0/softwareComponents/version" ],
        "reason" : "Not Found"
      }

.. _group-id:
.. _project-id:

Project ID
----------

Your Project ID is a string value that uniquely identifies a
|service| project.

|service| projects were previously identified as "groups". Some
|service| endpoints reference ``group`` or ``{GROUP-ID}`` as part of
the request path, query, or body parameters. For any endpoint that
requires your ``{GROUP-ID}``, specify your Project ID instead.

To retrieve your project ID:

.. include:: /includes/steps-view-project-id.rst

Authentication
--------------

The {+atlas-admin-api+} uses one of two methods to authenticate
requests: |api| keys or service accounts. This ensures that the keys and the access tokens 
that serve as usernames and passwords are never sent over the network.
To learn more, see :ref:`api-authentication`.

For usage details, see :ref:`prog-access-usage`.

.. _api-rate-limiting:

Rate Limiting
-------------

Certain resources limit how many requests they can process per minute.

For these resources, |service| allows up to 100 requests per minute
*per project*. {+atlas-admin-api+} :ref:`authentication methods <api-authentication>` 
belong to an organization, but can be granted access to multiple projects.

.. example::

   Consider two users: A and B. User A belongs to project X, and user B
   belongs to projects X and Y.

   - At 1:00:00pm, User A makes 50 requests to a rate limited resource
     in project X, all of which are complete by 1:00:20pm.

   - At 1:00:30pm, User B attempts to make 60 requests to a rate
     limited resource in project X.

     Since User A has already used up 50 requests within the 1:00pm
     minute for project X, the last 10 requests User B attempts to make
     are rejected.

     However, User B can make requests to a rate limited resource in
     project Y, since each project maintains a separate request
     counter.

   - At 1:01:00pm, requests to project X may proceed, because the
     request counter used for rate limiting resets each minute.

If you exceed the rate limit, the {+atlas-admin-api+} returns a `429
<https://httpstatuses.com/429>`__ (Too Many Requests) |http| status
code.
