If MongoDB cannot split a chunk that exceeds the :ref:`specified chunk
size <sharding-chunk-size>`, MongoDB labels the chunk as 
:ref:`jumbo <jumbo-chunks>`.

If the chunk size no longer exceeds the :ref:`specified chunk size
<sharding-chunk-size>`, MongoDB automatically clears the ``jumbo`` flag
for the chunk when the :binary:`~bin.mongos` rewrites the chunk
metadata.

In cases where you need to clear the flag manually, however, the
following procedures outline the steps to manually clear the ``jumbo``
flag.

Procedures
----------

.. _preferred-method-clear-jumbo:

Divisible Chunks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The preferred manual way to clear the ``jumbo`` flag from a chunk is to
attempt to split the chunk. If the chunk is divisible, MongoDB removes
the flag upon successful split of the chunk.

.. include:: /includes/steps/clear-jumbo-flag-preferred.rst

Indivisible Chunks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some instances, MongoDB cannot split the no-longer ``jumbo`` chunk,
such as a chunk with a range of single shard key value. As such, you
cannot split the chunk to clear the flag.

In such cases, you can either refine the shard key so that the chunk
can become divisible or manually clear the flag.

Refine the Shard Key
````````````````````

Starting in 4.4, MongoDB provides the
:dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command. Using the
:dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command, you can refine a
collection's shard key by adding a suffix field or fields to the
existing key. By adding new field(s) to the shard key, indivisible
jumbo chunks can become divisible.

.. _clear-jumbo-flag-manually:

Manually Clear the ``jumbo`` Flag for an Indivisible Chunk
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

You can manually clear the flag using the following steps. 

.. important::

   If you clear the ``jumbo`` flag for a chunk that still exceeds the
   chunk size, MongoDB will re-label the chunk as ``jumbo`` when
   MongoDB tries to move the chunk.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoDB 4.2.3 and later (4.0.15 and later)
      :tabid: clear-flag-command

      Starting in version 4.2.3 and 4.0.15, MongoDB provides the
      :dbcommand:`clearJumboFlag` command to manually clear the
      ``jumbo`` flag.

      .. important::

         Only use this method if the :ref:`preferred method
         <preferred-method-clear-jumbo>` is *not* applicable.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/clear-jumbo-flag-command.rst
   

   .. tab:: MongoDB 4.2.2 and earlier (4.0.14 and earlier)
      :tabid: clear-flag-manual


      .. important::

         Only use this method if the :ref:`preferred method
         <preferred-method-clear-jumbo>` is *not* applicable.

         Before modifying the :doc:`config database
         </reference/config-database>`, *always* back up the config database.
