This guide provides background about the {+driver-short+} and its
asynchronous API before showing you how to use the driver and MongoDB in
the :ref:`Quick Start guide <javars-quickstart>`.

.. note::

   See the :ref:`Installation guide <javars-install>`
   for instructions on how to install the driver.

Reactive Streams
----------------

This library is an implementation of the reactive
streams specification. The reactive stream API consists
of the following components:

1. `Publisher <{+rs-docs+}/Publisher.html>`__
#. `Subscriber <{+rs-docs+}/Subscriber.html>`__
#. `Subscription <{+rs-docs+}/Subscription.html>`__

A ``Publisher`` is a provider of a potentially
unbounded number of sequenced elements, published
according to the demand received from its ``Subscriber`` or multiple
instances of ``Subscriber``.

In response to a call to ``Publisher.subscribe(Subscriber)``, the
possible invocation sequences for methods on the ``Subscriber`` class
are given by the following protocol:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: false

   onSubscribe onNext* (onError | onComplete)?

This means that ``onSubscribe`` is always
signaled, followed by a possibly unbounded number
of ``onNext`` signals, as requested by
``Subscriber``. This is followed by an ``onError`` signal
if there is a failure or an ``onComplete`` signal
when no more elements are available, as long as
the ``Subscription`` is not canceled.

   the `Reactive Streams documentation <http://www.reactive-streams.org>`__.

Subscribers
-----------

The {+driver-short+} API mirrors the :driver:`Java Sync driver
</java/sync/current/>` API and any methods that cause network 
I/O to return a ``Publisher<T>`` type, where ``T`` is the type of response
for the operation.

.. note::

   All ``Publisher`` types returned from the API are
   `cold <https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#reactor.hotCold>`__,
   meaning that nothing happens until they are subscribed to. So just
   creating a ``Publisher`` won’t cause any network I/O. It’s not until
   you call the ``Publisher.subscribe()`` method that the driver executes
   the operation.
   
   Publishers in this implementation are *unicast*. Each
   ``Subscription`` to a ``Publisher`` relates to a single MongoDB
   operation, and the ``Publisher`` instance's ``Subscriber`` receives its
   own specific set of results.

Subscribers in the Quick Start
------------------------------

In the Quick Start, we have implemented a couple of
different ``Subscriber`` types. Although this is an
artificial scenario for reactive streams, we do
block on the results of one example before starting
the next, to ensure the state of the database.

- ``ObservableSubscriber``
    The base subscriber class is the
    `ObservableSubscriber<T>
    <{+driver-source-gh+}/blob/master/driver-reactive-streams/src/examples/reactivestreams/helpers/SubscriberHelpers.java>`__,
    a ``Subscriber`` that stores the results of the ``Publisher<T>``. It
    also contains an ``await()`` method so we can block for results
    to ensure the state of the database before going
    on to the next example.

- ``OperationSubscriber``
    An implementation of the
    ``ObservableSubscriber`` that immediately calls
    ``Subscription.request()`` when it is subscribed to.

- ``PrintSubscriber``
    An implementation of the ``OperationSubscriber``
    that prints a message when the ``Subscriber.onComplete()`` method is
    called.

- ``ConsumerSubscriber``
    An implementation of
    ``OperationSubscriber`` that takes a ``Consumer`` and calls
    ``Consumer.accept(result)`` when ``Subscriber.onNext(T result)`` is
    called.

- ``PrintToStringSubscriber``
    An implementation of
    ``ConsumerSubscriber`` that prints the string version of the
    ``result`` when the ``Subscriber.onNext()`` method is called.

- ``PrintDocumentSubscriber``
    An implementation of the
    ``ConsumerSubscriber`` that prints the JSON version of a ``Document``
    type when the ``Subscriber.onNext()`` method is called.

Blocking and Non-Blocking Examples
----------------------------------

As our ``Subscriber`` types contain a latch that is only
released when the ``onComplete()`` method of the
``Subscriber`` is called, we can use that latch
to block further actions by calling the ``await`` method.
The following two examples use our auto-requesting
``PrintDocumentSubscriber``.

The first is non-blocking and the second blocks
waiting for the ``Publisher`` to complete:

.. code-block:: java

   // Create a publisher
   Publisher<Document> publisher = collection.find();

   // Non-blocking
   publisher.subscribe(new PrintDocumentSubscriber());

   Subscriber<Document> subscriber = new PrintDocumentSubscriber();
   publisher.subscribe(subscriber);
   subscriber.await(); // Block for the publisher to complete

Publishers, Subscribers, and Subscriptions
------------------------------------------

In general, ``Publisher``, ``Subscriber`` and
``Subscription`` types comprise a low level API and it’s
expected that users and libraries will build more
expressive APIs upon them rather than solely use
these interfaces. As a library solely implementing
these interfaces, users will benefit from this
growing ecosystem, which is a core design principle
of reactive streams.
