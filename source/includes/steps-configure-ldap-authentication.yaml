  a. Enter values for the following **required LDAP configuration** fields:

     .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1
        :widths: 25 50 25

        * - Field

          - Action

          - Example

        * - :guilabel:`User Authentication Method`

          - Select :guilabel:`LDAP`.

          - ``LDAP``

        * - :guilabel:`LDAP URI`

          - Type the hostname and port of the LDAP server.

          - ``ldap://ldap.example.com:389``

        * - :guilabel:`LDAP SSL CA File`

          - Type the path to a PEM key file containing the certificate for
            the CA who signed the certificate used by the LDAPS server.
            This optional field is used by the |mms| application to
            verify the identify of the LDAPS server and prevent man-in-
            the-middle Attacks. If this configuration is not provided,
            |mms| uses the default root CA certificate bundle that
            comes with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). If your
            LDAPS server certificate cannot be verified by a root CA
            (i.e. if it is self-signed), requests to the LDAPS server
            fail.

          - ``/opt/cert/ca.pem``

        * - :guilabel:`LDAP SSL PEM Key File`

          - Type the path to a PEM key file containing a client certificate
            and private key. This field is optional and should be used
            only if your LDAPS server requires client certificates be
            passed by client applications. This is used to sign
            requests sent from the |mms| application server to the
            LDAPS server. This allows the LDAPS server to verify the
            identify of |mms| application server.

          - ``/opt/cert/ldap.pem``

        * - :guilabel:`LDAP SSL PEM Key File Password`

          - Type the password that decrypts the LDAP SSL PEM Key File. If your
            client certificates specified in the LDAP SSL PEM Key File field
            are required by the LDAPS server and if the client certificate
            specified in LDAP SSL PEM Key File is stored encrypted on the file
            system, this field is required.

          - ``<encrypted-password>``

        * - :guilabel:`LDAP Bind Dn`

          - Type a credentialed user on the LDAP server that can conduct searches for users.

          - ``cn=admin,
            dc=example,
            dc=com``

        * - :guilabel:`LDAP Bind Password`

          - Type the password for the Bind Dn user on the LDAP server.

          - ``<password>``

        * - :guilabel:`LDAP User Base Dn`

          - Type the Distinguished Name that |mms| uses to search for users on
            the LDAP server.

          - ``dc=example,
            dc=com``

        * - :guilabel:`LDAP User Search Attribute`

          - Type the LDAP field in the LDAP server that specifies the
            username.

          - ``uid``

        * - :guilabel:`LDAP User Group`

          - Type the LDAP attribute that contains the list
            of groups to which the LDAP user belongs. The LDAP attribute can
            use any format to list the groups, including Common Name (``cn``)
            or Distinguished Name (``dn``). All |onprem| settings that specify
            groups must match the chosen format.

          - ``memberof``

        * - :guilabel:`LDAP Global Role Owner`

          - Type the LDAP group to which |mms| Global Owners belong.

          - ``cn=global-owner,
            ou=groups,
            dc=example,
            dc=com``

     .. note::

        Each Global Role group provides the members of its associated
        LDAP group or groups with |a-mms| :ref:`global role <global-roles>`.
        Global roles provide access to all the |mms|
        :doc:`groups </tutorial/create-group>` in the |mms| deployment.

  b. Type values for the following **Optional LDAP Configuration**
     fields if needed.

     .. important::
        **Multiple LDAP Groups Can Map to One Role**

        |onprem| roles can include more than one LDAP group. Type
        multiple LDAP group names in the relevant role fields separated by
        two semicolons (``;;``).

     .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1
        :widths: 30 70

        * - Field

          - Action

        * - :guilabel:`LDAP User First Name`

          - Type the attribute of LDAP users that specifies the user's first
            name.

        * - :guilabel:`LDAP User Last Name`

          - Type the attribute of LDAP users that specifies the user's last
            name.

        * - :guilabel:`LDAP User Email`

          - Type the attribute of LDAP users that specifies the user's email
            address.

        * - :guilabel:`LDAP Global Role Backup Admin`

          - Type the LDAP group(s) to which |mms| Global Backup Administrators
            belong. You can type multiple LDAP groups into this field if they
            are separated by two semicolons (``;;``).

        * - :guilabel:`LDAP Global Role Monitoring Admin`

          - Type the LDAP group(s) to which |mms| Global Monitoring
            Administrators belong. You can type multiple LDAP groups
            into this field if they are separated by two semicolons
            (``;;``).

        * - :guilabel:`LDAP Global Role User Admin`

          - Type the LDAP group(s) to which |mms| Global User Administrators
            belong. You can type multiple LDAP groups into this field if they
            are separated by two semicolons (``;;``).

        * - :guilabel:`LDAP Global Role Read Only`

          - Type the LDAP group(s) to which |mms| Global Read Only Users
            belong. You can type multiple LDAP groups into this field if they
            are separated by two semicolons (``;;``).
