object:
  name: geoNear
  type: command
field:
  optional: true
  type: field
name: limit
type: number
position: 3
description: |
  The maximum number of documents to return. The default value is ``100``.
  See also the ``num`` option.

object:
  name: geoNear
  type: command
field:
  optional: true
  type: field
name: num
type: number
position: 4
description: |
  The ``num`` option provides the same function as the ``limit`` option.
  Both define the maximum number of documents to return. If both options
  are included, the ``num`` value overrides the ``limit`` value.

object:
  name: geoNear
  type: command
field:
  optional: true
  type: field
name: maxDistance
type: number
position: 5
description: |
  A distance from the center point. Specify the distance in meters for
  :term:`GeoJSON` data and
  in radians for :term:`legacy coordinate pairs <legacy coordinate
  pairs>`. MongoDB limits the results to those documents that fall
  within the specified distance from the center point.
---
object:
  name: geoNear
  type: command
field:
  optional: true
  type: field
name: query
type: document
position: 6
description: |
  Limits the results to the documents that match the query. The query
  syntax is the usual MongoDB :ref:`read operation query
  <read-operations-query-argument>` syntax.
---
object:
  name: geoNear
  type: command
field:
  optional: true
  type: field
name: spherical
type: Boolean
position: 7
description: |
  If ``true``, MongoDB references points using a spherical surface. The
  default value is ``false``.
---
object:
  name: geoNear
  type: command
field:
  optional: true
  type: field
name: distanceMultiplier
type: number
position: 8
description: |
  The factor to multiply all distances returned by the query. For
  example, use the ``distanceMultiplier`` to convert radians, as
  returned by a spherical query, to kilometers by multiplying by the
  radius of the Earth.
---
object:
  name: geoNear
  type: command
field:
  optional: true
  type: field
name: includeLocs
type: Boolean
position: 9
description: |
  If this is ``true``, the query
  returns the location of the matching documents in the results. The
  default is ``false``. This option is useful when a location field
  contains multiple locations. To specify a field within a
  subdocument, use :term:`dot notation`.

object:
  name: geoNear
  type: command
field:
  optional: true
  type: field
name: uniqueDocs
type: Boolean
position: 10
description: |
  .. deprecated:: 2.5.5

  If this value is ``true``, the query returns a matching document once,
  even if more than one of the document's location fields match the
  query. If this value is ``false``, the query returns a document
  multiple times if the document has multiple matching location fields.
  See :query:`$uniqueDocs` for more information.
