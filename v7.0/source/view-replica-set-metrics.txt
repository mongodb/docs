A :manual:`replica set </replication>` in MongoDB is a group of 
:binary:`~bin.mongod` processes that maintain the same data set. To 
view the metrics for a specific |mms| replica set deployment
in a :ref:`project <projects>`, click the :guilabel:`Metrics`
button for that deployment. Alternatively, click on the name of
the deployment to open the deployment overview, then click the
:guilabel:`Metrics` tab.

The :guilabel:`Metrics` view has three distinct sections:

Chart Controls

|mms| provides the following controls for the :guilabel:`Metric`
view. Adjusting any of these options affects all charts
displayed under the :guilabel:`Metrics` view:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 35 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Control

Chart Selection
---------------

|mms| displays the available metrics to chart for the selected
deployment under the :guilabel:`Toggle Charts` header. Metrics
are grouped into two sections:

:guilabel:`MongoDB Metrics`
  Metrics associated with the MongoDB process. For metrics
  related to database performance, such as
  :guilabel:`DB Storage`, |mms| presents the sum total across
  all databases in the deployment.

  If you enable
  :guilabel:`Display Opcounters on Separate Charts`,
  |mms| replaces the :guilabel:`Opcounters` option with the
  individual components of that chart.

:guilabel:`Hardware Metrics`
  Metrics associated with the host machines supporting the
  deployment.

  - Charts marked with :icon:`plus` are inactive.
  - Charts marked with  :icon:`minus` are active.

Click on any chart to toggle the chart state.
